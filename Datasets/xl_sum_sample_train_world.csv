"Mr Kim still maintains ""absolute authority"", but handed various policy areas to others to reduce his stress levels, the spy agency reportedly said. Ms Kim is now ""steering overall state affairs"", the National Intelligence Service added. However, Seoul's spy agency has been wrong about North Korea in the past. The claims were reportedly made during a closed-door briefing on Thursday to South Korea's National Assembly. Lawmakers then discussed the assessment with journalists. ""Kim Jong-un is still maintaining his absolute authority, but some of it has been handed over little by little,"" the agency was quoted as saying. Ms Kim now has responsibility for Pyongyang's policy towards the US and South Korea, among other policy issues, and is ""the de-facto number two leader,"" it added, although it stressed that Mr Kim had ""not selected a successor."" Mr Kim's decision to delegate was in part to ""relieve stress from his reign and avert culpability in the event of policy failure,"" it said. However, some analysts have been sceptical of the intelligence, with website NKNews noting that she appeared to have missed two important meetings this month, leading to speculation from some observers that she may have been demoted. Who is Kim Yo-jong? She is the younger sister of Kim Jong-un and the only one of his siblings considered a close and powerful ally. Born in 1987, she is four years younger than Mr Kim. The two of them lived and studied in Bern, Switzerland, at the same time. Ms Kim first gained international attention in 2018, when she was the first member of the Kim dynasty to visit South Korea. She was part of the delegation to the Winter Olympics, where North and South competed as a joint team. She also worked alongside her brother at international summits, including his meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, China's Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. There's no doubt Kim Yo-jong is on the rise. Some analysts believe the crisis earlier this year between North and South Korea which saw the inter-Korean liaison office blown to bits was manufactured just to give her a major platform. She issued her first public statement in March. It was a scathing verbal attack condemning the South. She later noted that she had been given ""power authorised by the Supreme Leader, our Party and the state"". She also wrote about the potential for a summit between Kim Jong-un and President Trump later this year, insisting that North Korea did not have the ""slightest intention to pose a threat to the US"". All of which suggests she may have been given responsibility to influence policies toward the United States and South Korea. Let's caveat this a little. This does not mean she will succeed her brother as leader of North Korea. She is also not the only one to have been given extra responsibilities. Other aides have been handed some power too. It is also worth noting that the intelligence briefing specifically states that Kim Jong Un remains in overall control - he is merely delegating. He will still have the final say. But it is yet another indication that Kim Yo-jong has gone from hiding behind pillars at public events and carrying ashtrays for her brother to being at the forefront of North Korea's foreign policy. How reliable is South Korea's spy agency? North Korea is one of the world's most secretive societies. South Korea's National Intelligence Service may have more intelligence on the North than most other organisations, but it has still had a mixed record. For example, in 2016, South Korean media cited a similar briefing by the spy agency in which it was said that the chief of staff of the North Korean army, Ri Yong-gil, had been executed. Three months later, the South Korean government said that he appeared to be alive, as his name had appeared on a list of party officials. In 2017, the spy agency also admitted it tried to manipulate the result of the 2012 presidential election in the South.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has delegated more responsibilities to his aides, including his sister Kim Yo-jong, South Korea's spy agency claims."
"Overgrown bushes and trees could result in people jumping traffic lights or missing important signs, the States of Guernsey has said. A law states hedges bordering a public road must be cut between 1-15 June and 15-30 September. Parish constables are to check the law is complied with. However, residents should make sure road signs are clear throughout the year, a States spokesperson added.",Residents are being urged to trim vegetation on roadsides in Guernsey because of fears about accidents.
"And anyone doubting the determination needed to undertake such an event in Swaziland, now known as eSwatini, just needed to open last week's Sunday Observer. A full-page letter accused those organising the march of promoting ""paedophilia and bestiality"", calling on the organisers to ""cancel this gay Pride until Emaswati have decided that they will choose this unnatural behaviour"". 'Turn hate into love' But for Melusi Simelane, communications officer for LGBTI rights group Rock of Hope, which is organising the event in the capital, it was a case of: ""If not now, when?"" ""The right time will never come,"" he told the BBC. ""It is an issue of being courageous enough. So we decided if no-one is going to do it, we would."" So on 30 June, in a country where homosexuality is still illegal, Mr Simelane will join what he hopes will be 2,000 other LGBTI people and supporters in the capital Mbabane, united by the slogan ""turn hate into love"". ""I was so impressed by his determination, really against all the odds, to pull this off,"" said Matt Beard, chief executive of All Out, a ""global movement for love and equality"" which helped support the event. ""There have not been many Prides in Africa, and this is a small country - an absolute monarchy where homosexuality is illegal - and this young guy had this vision to pull together this moment. ""This will be the first time this community has been able to come together in public, to have that level of dignity and pride in themselves."" However, that doesn't mean the idea of walking proudly through the streets of this tiny nation - home to just 1.1 million people - isn't slightly nerve wracking, even if the authorities have given permission for it to go ahead. You might also like: ""It's mixed feelings,"" one man - a gay preacher - told the BBC. He asked not to be named. ""If they see you, they will disown you and reject you and all this stuff,"" he explained. ""But my other side is that I am happy. We will have a stand for the church to support the LGBTI community."" That support is something which has been lacking from his own experience, and those of the largely LGBTI community he already preaches to. According to a human rights report by the US embassy in 2017, LGBTI people who live openly face ""censure and exclusion"". And while prosecutions are rare, high-profile figures often take a very public stance against the LGBTI community. King Mswati III is widely reported to have called homosexuality ""satanic"", while the country's chief police communications officer, Khulani Mamba, who doubles up as a preacher, told his congregation last weekend that ""this country will not tolerate the LGBTI community"", according to the Swazi Times. The rhetoric is something Mr Simelane recognises. ""There is persecution each and every day,"" Mr Simelane said. ""We are harassed, we are violently abused, we are emotionally abused."" And yet, Mr Simelane, who is a full-time student alongside his role at Rock of Hope, says that in fact, most people are excited to see what Saturday brings. ""We are a small country with a very welcoming culture. Everyone is interesting to see what it is going to look like,"" he said. And as they get closer to the march, which will be followed by a family-friendly event complete with bouncy castle at the Prince of Wales stadium, the excitement grows. Nontobeko Dlamini, the executive director of another Swazi LGBTI group, House Of Our Pride, told the BBC: ""It makes me happy to be alive and to see this day. ""We have lost the ones that started this but we are here to see it through."" More about Swaziland/ eSwatini:",Africa's last absolute monarchy is holding its first LGBTI Pride event this weekend.
"The court in Lahore also ordered Shahzad Saqib to pay a £1,433 ($1,900) fine, rejecting his argument that Islam allowed him to have up to four wives. Saqib's first wife Ayesha Bibi had successfully argued that marrying without her written approval was a breach of Pakistan's family law. Women's rights activists said the verdict would discourage polygamy. They also said it would empower women and could result in more women in similar situations taking up their cases with the courts. ""It is encouraging that a wronged woman has used this law to complain to the court,"" Romana Bashir, who heads the Peace and Development Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, told Reuters news agency. ""The decision augurs well for women's empowerment,"" she added. In Pakistan, men who take multiple wives usually do so after a period of several years - and must get written approval from their first wife prior to a second marriage. Pakistan's Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), a body that provides legal advice to the government on Islamic issues, has often criticised the country's family law. However, recommendations by the CII are not legally binding. Saqib has the right to appeal against Wednesday's verdict.",A Pakistan court has jailed a man for six months for marrying a second woman without his wife's permission.
"The old facility at Manor Stores closed last year and the bins moved to a temporary site at St Martin's Garage. The Public Services Department has since been looking for a new permanent home for the bins in the parish. While discussions are continuing with the owners of Manor Stores a planning application has been put forward for an alternative in Burnt Lane. A spokesperson for the department said: ""We are very keen that the parish does not lose its recycling facilities, so we are looking at all options to maintain these provisions.""","Work is continuing to try to find a permanent home for a recycling bank in St Martin, Guernsey."
"A 40 sq km area including Ramsey Bay has been put forward as a possible site for the nature reserve. Under the proposal the area would be closed to scallop dredging and queenie trawling to help replenish fish stocks. The suggestion was made by the Manx Fish Producers Organisation and is being supported by the IOM government. Queenie fisherman, Michael Inglesfield said: ""Everything is for the future. We do fish in Ramsey Bay when there are South Westerly winds but if it is closed then we will just have to get round it. ""If this is going to benefit the next generation of fishermen then it can only be a good thing."" The Isle of Man government has held a series of public meetings for anyone with an interest in marine matters to determine where the zone should be located - this latest news indicates that the north of the island is now a strong possibility. Marine biodiversity officer, Fiona Gell said: ""It means we can combine protection of this special marine habitat with our efforts to allow the scallop fisheries to recover"". There will now be a formal consultation on the proposal with more workshops and meetings to be arranged.",Plans to make a stretch of the Isle of Man's coastline into a Marine Conservation Zone have been welcomed by local fisherman.
"The ""milestone"" follows only one positive test result in the last seven days, according to the latest government statistics. The medical officer of health Dr Susan Turnbull said the achievement was ""testament"" to the public's efforts. Jersey is due to reopen its borders to all travellers on 3 July under level two of its exit strategy. The island has experienced 319 positive cases of the virus, and 31 Covid-related deaths. On Monday, the government announced there were only two active cases of coronavirus, both of whom were asymptomatic. The latest statistics show there are 415 test results pending. 'Not gone away' Dr Susan Turnbull said: ""It is a testament to the collective efforts and resilience of the people of Jersey, and the actions of government as well as my exceptional colleagues, notably Dr Ivan Muscat as our expert on infection control, that we - meaning all islanders - have managed to contain, and now suppress the spread of Covid infection so effectively. ""We find ourselves in an excellent position as we move into midsummer."" Dr Muscat described it as an ""important day"", but urged islanders to remember ""coronavirus has not gone away."" Under level two of the lockdown, people must keep a 1m (3ft 3in) physical distance in public spaces, but shops, restaurants and pubs have all been allowed to reopen. The States of Jersey is due to make a final decision on opening the island's borders on Wednesday.","Jersey has no ""known"" active cases of coronavirus, the island's government has confirmed."
"Byun Hui-soo, 22, joined the army as a man but had gender reassignment surgery last year after suffering from gender dysphoria and mental health issues. She accused the military of ""deep-rooted intolerance"" of sexual minorities. South Korea remains conservative on matters of sexual identity. Ms Byun's case has led to debate over the treatment of transgender soldiers as well as those from the wider LGBT community. All able-bodied South Korean men are required to carry out military service for nearly two years. What did Byun Hui-soo say? During an emotional 45-minute appearance, the staff sergeant said she had wanted to stay in the army after her operation, which took place in Thailand in November. ""I will continue to fight until the day I can remain to serve in the army. I'll challenge the decision until the end, to the Supreme Court,"" she said. She had not planned on having gender reassignment surgery, she said, but was recommended to do so by doctors at a military hospital where she was sent after suffering mental health problems. They arose from gender dysphoria - defined as distress from the internal conflict between physical gender and gender identity. ""It was an extremely difficult decision to let my base know of my identity, but once I did, I felt much better,"" she said. ""I thought I would finish serving in the army and then go through the transition surgery and then re-enter the army as a female soldier. But my depression got too severe,"" she added. Ms Byun said she had not expected to be forced to leave the army. Her superior officers had visited her in hospital and had been discussing where she would be redeployed after her treatment, she said. They had suggested she could become a role model for LGBT people in the armed forces, she said. ""Apart from my gender identity, I want to show everyone that I can also be one of the great soldiers who protect this country,"" she added. What has the military said? In its ruling, the military said the case ""constitutes a reason for being unable to continue service"". A defence ministry spokesman told AFP news agency that the soldier had been undergoing tests at a military hospital, which classified the loss of male genitals as a mental or physical handicap. That prompted a panel review of her service. The military does not have regulations governing the service of transgender soldiers. The military statement added that it was determined to avoid ""unfair discrimination and treatment"". But Lim Tae-hoon from the Center for Military Human Rights said Ms Byun's discharge was unusual because it was effective the day after the decision was made. Usually they are effective after a period of up to three months, he said. It suggested that the army did not want Ms Byun to have contact with her unit, Mr Lim said. An army official who was aware of the case told Reuters news agency there should be no reason for the military to deny Ms Byun if she reapplied to serve in the female corps after legally becoming a woman. How are attitudes towards transgender people in South Korea? In South Korea, being LGBT is often seen as a disability or a mental illness, or by powerful conservative churches as a sin, and there are no anti-discrimination laws in the country. In Ms Byun's case, anti-LGBT campaigners had attempted to identify her online. They also held demonstrations urging the military to dismiss her after news about the case emerged and have called for further demonstrations. Rights groups that have taken up her cause have been accused of tarnishing the military's image. However BBC Korean's Hyung Eun Kim says that the rise of events such as LGBT parades shows attitudes in the country are changing, albeit slowly. Rights groups have also previously expressed concern about the way South Korea treats gay soldiers. They are banned from engaging in sexual contact and can face up to two years in prison if caught. Gay sex is not illegal in civilian life. Where in the world can transgender soldiers serve? They could in the US, until President Donald Trump banned certain transgender people from the military. The ban was upheld by the Supreme Court last January although legal challenges have been continuing in lower courts. The policy prohibits ""transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition"" from serving. Mr Trump announced on Twitter in 2017 that the ban was needed due to ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". There are nearly 9,000 active duty transgender troops, non-profit groups say. The move reversed Obama administration policy that ruled transgender Americans could serve openly in the military as well as obtain funding for gender reassignment surgery. In the UK, transgender people are able to serve openly in the military. Last June a transgender former army officer was awarded a medal for services to the LGBT community in the military. Other countries to allow transgender people to serve openly include many Western European countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Israel and Bolivia.",A transgender soldier in South Korea says she will sue the army after it dismissed her for violating regulations following her sex change.
"Ben Gerring, 29, was in the water near Mandurah, south of Perth, when the attack occurred on Tuesday afternoon. Western Australia Police said Mr Gerring's injuries were too severe to overcome and he died on Friday night. On Thursday, a 4.2m (14ft) great white shark was captured near Mandurah, but it is not known if this shark was to blame for the attack. ""He was right out the back looking to get a big wave, one of the set waves that had been coming through during the day,"" Brian Williams, president of the Mandurah Boardriders Club and friend of the victim, told ABC on Tuesday. ""He'd sort of paddled out the back, sort of past the pack slightly. And next thing all hell broke loose and they were trying to bring him in. ""His board was broken in half, they found the tail part of his board,"" Mr Williams said. Surf Lifesaving Western Australia had reportedly issued a warning before the attack, after an unknown species of shark was seen in the area.","A surfer who lost his leg in a shark attack in Western Australia last week has died, police say."
"By Paul CarterHobart, Tasmania It was the worst mass shooting in Australia's history and for many years it has defined the town, although among locals it is a sensitive, almost taboo topic. The gunman, Martin Bryant, is one of the country's most notorious villains, but his name is rarely spoken in Port Arthur. So people were surprised and dismayed in March this year when an actor drove a yellow Volvo around the massacre site at the behest of a major Australian television network. ""To hire a yellow Volvo with a surfboard on the roof and a have a blonde, long-haired man drive around the site so they could film it was an extraordinarily horrible thing to do,"" said local mayor Roseanne Heyward. The media rehashing of Australia's Port Arthur shooting massacre in the lead-up to Thursday's 20th anniversary has been upsetting for the community, leaving many people keen for the day to be done. Since March there has been an outpouring of reports on the massacre, boasting of never-before-seen material, first-time accounts, graphic retellings and television re-enactments. Capping that was news this week of a graphic movie of the massacre, playing to conspiracy theories Bryant wasn't the killer, that is due to start filming this year. Stephen Large is chief executive of the Port Arthur Historic Site, the former penal colony and world heritage-listed site where Bryant shot most of his victims. Mr Large said the television re-enactments and rehashing of the massacre were disappointing, particularly the Volvo drive-by re-creation. ""That rocked quite a few people here and certainly upset a lot of people in the local community, and I'm sure a lot of people that were directly affected by 1996,"" Mr Large said, adding that any requests to film a movie at the site would be assessed on their merits. 'How could you refuse?' Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull heads the dignitaries attending a Thursday ceremony marking 20 years since the massacre. The two-hour ceremony, the first at the site since the 10th anniversary, will be broadcast live on two of the country's television networks. Former prime minister John Howard, who moved swiftly and decisively to ban the possession, use and importation of semi-automatic and automatic rifles following the shootings, will also be among those at the ceremony. Despite the reluctance of some locals to mark the tragedy, many victims' relatives were determined to hold a milestone ceremony. Some survivors will return to the site for the first time since that Sunday in 1996. Mayor Heyward said compassion for these people made the service a necessity. ""How could you refuse them?"" she asked. ""But we have moved on, we'll never forget, but we have to get up every morning and get on with our lives and that is what this community has done."" Better forgotten Martin Bryant, now aged 48, is serving 35 consecutive life sentences. Many people object even to the use of Bryant's name, with local media often bombarded with complaints if he is mentioned in reports. Tasmania Times news website editor Lindsay Tuffin said Tasmanians wanted Bryant excised from memory. ""There is no doubt that they do not want to even ponder it,"" he said. ""They just wish he never existed."" The feeling is so strong that visitors to the Port Arthur Historic Site are usually urged not to ask questions about the massacre. ""Rather than ask a guide, please read the plaque at the Memorial Garden or pick up a brochure at the Visitor Centre,"" an instruction reads. Hobart Mercury editor Matt Deighton said local media approached the topic in a completely different way to mainland publications. ""It's as sensitive an issue as I've experienced in 26 years of journalism,"" he said. ""Our coverage will be subtle and respectful, focusing on the anniversary and how the community has tried, at varying levels of success, to move on."" Thursday's ceremony may be unsettling for those who would rather forget the senseless violence in 1996. But Stephen Large from the Port Arthur Historic Site is hopeful that it will be a positive experience for victims and the community. ""There are some people coming who we know haven't been back to the site for 20 years so it will be particularly poignant for them and we hope it's worthwhile for them,"" Mr Large said.","Twenty years ago a young, blonde-haired man who drove a yellow Volvo with a surfboard strapped to the top killed 35 people at Port Arthur, a historic tourist town in Tasmania."
"Video of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam being beaten by an officer on 10 March went viral. The incident in Fort McMurray, Alberta, began over an expired registration plate. Mr Adam was charged with assaulting police and resisting arrest. After seeing the clip, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had ""serious questions"" about the officer's conduct. Mr Adam learned about the charges being dropped on Wednesday as he was due in court. ""I'm overwhelmed that the charges have been withdrawn,"" Mr Adam said at a news conference. ""My wife and I knew we didn't do nothing wrong. It was just for an expired licence plate."" Mr Adam has said he was targeted because he was indigenous, and is calling for Canadian policing reforms. The incident, which took place last March, is being investigated by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, which oversees incidents involving police where someone is hurt. The RCMP's Alberta division has previously said they reviewed the footage and found the officer's actions ""reasonable"". Constable Simon Seguin, the officer who arrested Mr Adam, remains on duty, and is facing charges of unlawfully entering a house, mischief and assault stemming from an unrelated incident on 5 August 2019. On Wednesday, the division confirmed charges had been dropped. RCMP said in a written statement: ""The role of the police is to investigate and gather evidence in support of a charge and the RCMP fulfilled that role on this file. ""The Crown's role is to assess the elements of the offence and to determine if they prosecute."" What happened? The incident began when an RCMP officer approached Mr Adam and his wife over an expired registration plate in a car park outside a casino. The nearly 12-minute video, recorded by a dashcam from the RCMP officer's vehicle parked behind Mr Adam's lorry, begins with Mr Adam having a tense and profanity-laden discussion with the officer. ""I'm tired of being harassed by the RCMP,"" he says. Mr Adam and the officer continue to have a heated argument. At about the 4:45 mark, the officer tries to arrest Mr Adam's wife, twisting her arm behind her back until she says: ""Ow!"" That is when Mr Adam gets out again, shouting: ""Leave my wife alone!"" He pushes the officer away. Everyone gets back in the vehicle. Backup is called, and Mr Adam gets out of the lorry. The officer begins to arrest him, and Mr Adam says ""don't touch me"", using an expletive. That is when a second officer runs at him full speed, knocks him down, and repeatedly punches him while shouting: ""Don't resist.""",All charges have been dropped against an indigenous chief who was battered by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
"The binding decision came after heated discussions at a summit in Brussels, as some members had argued that their varied interests should be protected. Correspondents say the final deal is a compromise between countries that rely heavily on coal, and those willing to instil greater emissions cuts. Environmental groups welcomed the deal, but said it did not go far enough. The bloc also agreed to boost the use of renewable energy to 27% in the total energy mix and increase energy efficiency to at least 27%. There were deep divisions within the EU on emissions cuts. Poland, which is heavily reliant on coal, fears that the costs of decarbonising its economy will slow business growth. Its concerns at the summit were echoed by other central and east European members. The President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, said afterwards that some poorer EU members would get help - including additional funds - in reaching the agreed targets. The UK also had opposed nationally binding targets for renewables - mainly wind, solar and hydroelectric power. It is embracing shale gas and nuclear as alternatives to the current over-reliance on oil and gas imports. 'Very modest' package Leaders had been cautious about the prospect of a deal, before holding talks late into the night. But in the early hours of Friday, Mr Van Rompuy, wrote in a tweet: ""Deal! At least 40% emissions cut by 2030. World's most ambitious, cost-effective, fair #EU2030 climate energy policy agreed ."" The EU Commissioner for Climate Action, Connie Hedegaard, said she was ""very proud"" that the leaders ""were able to get their act together on this pressing climate challenge"". Ed Davey, the UK's Energy Secretary, described the deal as ""a historic moment"". ""Europe has sent a clear and firm message to the world that ambitious climate action is needed now,"" Mr Davey said. ""This morning only five countries in Europe had climate targets post 2020, now 28 countries do. ""It's good for consumers because we can decarbonise at the lowest possible cost using a diverse mix of technologies. And it's good for business as it provides the certainty they have been calling for to unlock billions in low carbon investment."" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""We made a decisive step forward."" The EU is already on target to cut its CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, compared with 1990 emission levels. EU officials earlier said they wanted the EU to have an ""ambitious position"" in the run up to the UN climate change conference in Paris in December 2015. Analysis: By Roger Harrabin, BBC Environment Analyst The EU calls its climate deal ambitious- but it's unlikely to achieve Europe's own commitment to avoiding the risk of dangerous climate change. Tackling climate change needs a transformation of the world's energy economy over decades - and experts say a 40% cut in 2030 leaves too big a task for the next generation of politicians. Europe says it accepts the need to reduce emissions by more than 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. But this new deal leaves future leaders to cut CO2 threefold within 20 years - an effort UN experts say is nigh impossible. The deal is a compromise between countries like the UK, willing to stretch to 50% by 2030, and Poland and others which heavily rely on coal. Scientists and environmentalists will not be happy - but Europe's leaders have been under heavy pressure not to impose much higher energy costs, especially when the economy is struggling. The EU leaders said the crisis in Ukraine and turmoil in the Middle East had made it clear Europe needed to be less reliant on outside sources of energy, the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels reports. And they will now be able to press large polluters like China and India to follow Europe's lead, our correspondent adds. However, environmentalist groups said the EU could have done more. Joris den Blanken of Greenpeace called it a ""very modest"" package. ""It will mean a slowdown in clean energy development in Europe,'' he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Natalia Alonso of Oxfam welcomed the 40% target but said it fell ""far too short"", while the European Environment Bureau, a coalition of environmental organisations, condemned the targets as ""desperately ineffective"". Jeremy Wates, EEB Secretary General, said the targets needed to be higher, adding: ""With this abysmal result, Europe's leaders have failed their citizens and failed the world."" In the Belgian capital, the EU leaders were also expected to agree to boost measures to stop the spread of Ebola. The UK is expected to urge its EU partners to send more medics and equipment to West Africa, in line with the UK's help for Sierra Leone.","EU leaders have reached a landmark deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels."
"Mr Capriles said there were more than 300,000 incidents from Sunday's poll that needed to be examined. But the electoral authorities said Socialist Nicolas Maduro would be confirmed as the winner. He has called for the results to be respected. The National Electoral Council is due to formally proclaim Mr Maduro's victory at a ceremony and rally in Caracas later on Monday. The election was called after Mr Chavez's death from cancer on 5 March. Mr Maduro, a former bus driver whom Mr Chavez had named as his preferred heir, won 50.7% of the vote against 49.1% for Mr Capriles. The National Electoral Council said the results, which it announced on Sunday night, were ""irreversible"". Russian President Vladimir Putin and Cuban leader Raul Castro were among the first heads of state to congratulate Mr Maduro on his win. But the US has called for an audit of the results. ""This appears an important, prudent and necessary step to ensure that all Venezuelans have confidence in these results,"" a White House spokesman said. 'Work together' As the news of Mr Maduro's victory emerged, celebrations erupted in the capital, Caracas. Thousands of jubilant supporters took to the streets, dancing, singing and blasting car horns, while fireworks lit up the night sky. Opposition voters banged pots and pans in protest. Speaking outside the presidential palace, Mr Maduro told crowds that the result was ""just, legal and constitutional"". He said his election showed Hugo Chavez ""continues to be invincible, that he continues to win battles''. Mr Maduro, who was wearing a tracksuit top in the colours of the Venezuelan flag, said he had spoken to Mr Capriles on the phone, and that he would allow an audit of the election result. He called for those who had not voted for him to ""work together"" for the country. But Mr Maduro's margin of victory was far narrower than that achieved by Chavez at elections last October, when he beat Mr Capriles by more than 10 percentage points. Almost immediately, one member of the National Electoral Council who does not have government sympathies called on the authorities to carry out a recount by hand, a call later echoed by Mr Capriles himself. At Mr Capriles' campaign headquarters the mood was sombre, as his supporters watched the results on television. Some cried, while others hung their heads in dismay, Shortly afterwards, Mr Capriles emerged, angry and defiant. ""It is the government that has been defeated,"" he said. Then, addressing Mr Maduro directly, he said: ""The biggest loser today is you. The people don't love you. ""Mr Maduro, if you were illegitimate before, now you are more so."" The new president faces an extremely complex task in office, says the BBC's Central America correspondent, Will Grant. Venezuela has one of the highest rates of inflation in the region and crime rates have soared in recent years, particularly in Caracas. Food shortages and electricity blackouts are also common. But perhaps Mr Maduro's biggest challenge will be trying to govern a country which is so deeply divided and polarised, and where the opposition say they have an increasingly legitimate stake in the decision-making process, our correspondent says. The closeness of the race has also caused introspection inside Mr Maduro's own United Socialist Party (PSUV). The man considered to be Mr Maduro's main rival, National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, tweeted that the results ""oblige us to make a profound self-criticism"". Divisive legacy Mr Maduro had been serving as acting president since Mr Chavez died. He is due to be sworn in on 19 April and serve until January 2019 to complete the six-year term that Mr Chavez would have begun in January. Mr Chavez was a divisive leader. To his supporters he was the reforming president whose idiosyncratic brand of socialism defeated the political elite and gave hope to the poorest Venezuelans. He effectively used his country's vast oil reserves to boost Venezuela's international clout, and his strident criticism of the US won him many political allies in Latin America. However, his political opponents accused him of being an autocrat, intent on building a one-party state.","Defeated Venezuelan presidential candidate Henrique Capriles has demanded a recount of votes, rejecting the election of Hugo Chavez's successor as ""illegitimate""."
"By Ritu PrasadBBC News ""In the first round of flooding, we had over 150 acres under water,"" Mr Hurst recalls. ""A lot of it had been planted, so those crops are lost."" That was in March, when the Midwest's first bout of heavy rainstorms coupled with melting snow saw rivers inundate communities. ""It's been one damn thing after another."" Since then, America's heartland has had little reprieve from rain. May was the second-wettest month in recorded US history. In addition to rain, the thunderstorms brought a slew of tornados - over 500 in May alone, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service (NWS). And all the while, rivers and lakes continued to fill and crest, breaking years of records, pouring over levees and barriers, covering highways, bridges and towns. There have been over 35 flood-related deaths in the region so far, according to NWS. ""The US is split in two for hundreds of miles,"" says Mr Hurst, who is the president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, describing the water's sprawl from north of Omaha, Nebraska, down past St Louis, Missouri. As of 10 June, around 200 river gauges along the Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas rivers are still reporting flood levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ""We've seen more flooding in the past decade than we've seen in the decades before. This has gone past that into something historic."" Environmental scientist Prof Samuel Munoz of Northeastern University also says 2019 will make the history books. It's ""unusual"" for the Great Plains and Midwest, he notes, to see this number of repeated strong storms and severe weather in one spring. Part of that could be because of El Niño - a natural weather event that brings unusually warm sea-surface temperatures to the Pacific. ""El Niño conditions tend to enhance precipitation and severe weather over the areas that are flooding,"" Prof Munoz explains. ""Manmade climate change intensifies these natural variations, causing more rain to fall in what would already have been a wet year."" More on climate change Keith Hillman, director of the emergency management team in Vilonia, Arkansas, says his city has seen over 4.5ft [1.4m] of rain since January. ""It's well above the normal rainfall this year and anytime you have that much rain, it's gotta go somewhere eventually. ""I've been told by our county judge that they think the river won't be at normal stages until the end of July."" When I spoke to Mr Hillman last week, his team was preparing for nearby Lake Conway to flood. At one point, officials said the water levels in the lake's reservoir were rising a foot per hour. ""It's hard to control Mother Nature,"" Mr Hillman told me, resigned. ""This is just our time."" But the way these major rivers are managed could also be contributing to these historic floods. The Mississippi River system contains an elaborate network of dams, levees and spillways, run by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Prof Munoz says. ""These management efforts have straightened, steepened, and narrowed the river, and our research has shown that these changes cause floodwaters to flow higher and faster."" Such structures are undoubtedly needed from an economic standpoint, but Prof Munoz says the problem lies in the fact that these systems were designed for a mid-20th Century climate. ""As the climate continues to change, we need to have a conversation nationally and globally about how we are going to live and work in low-lying areas,"" he says. ""If we ignore this problem, our water management systems will continue to be overwhelmed - and we'll continue to have our assumptions of what is 'safe' from flooding challenged."" Unlike some disasters, flooding - especially on this scale - is a long haul, says Lori Arnold, director of the Greater Arkansas American Red Cross. The Red Cross has been operating 10 shelters in Arkansas and around as many in neighbouring states. In addition to providing food and a safe place to stay to hundreds, Ms Arnold notes the volunteers have been providing mental health services, too. Midwesterners are proud of being self-sufficient, she says. Many try to last out the floods in their own homes as long as possible. But this year things have been different. ""People living on the riverbanks, they're used to flooding and they hear about this all the time,"" Ms Arnold says. ""The hardest thing for them is flooding fatigue."" She says many shelter residents have told her that they were reticent to leave their homes because of how many times official warnings had exaggerated the situation. ""So for those who actually had to leave, they're a bit in shock because they'd gotten immune to it."" The Mississippi and its tributary, the Missouri, make-up the longest river system in North America. Floods are expected - but 2019 harkens back to the worst of them. The swollen rivers this spring have broken a dam in one instance and dramatically breached levees across the region. ""In our part of the world, you think of 1952, 1993, and now we're going to think about 2019,"" Missouri farmer Blake Hurst says. In 1993, following persistent spring and summer storms, the waters of the Mississippi lurched over their banks and flooded 400,000 sq miles across nine states. Fifty people died. Damages were close to $15bn (£11bn). It rained nearly every day in June and July of 1993. Forecasts for 2019 predict between 33-50% chances of above-average rainfall on the Midwest's already water-logged soil. This week, the National Weather Service had flood alerts along the Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. Waters are receding in parts, but the NWS reports 125 river gauges from Minnesota to Missouri predict a 50% or greater chance of flooding from June to August. On Sunday, the Mississippi crested in St Louis at just over 46ft - its second-highest in history, and only 3.5ft short of its 1993 record, according to the NWS. And all along the Midwest, the river stands to break records from 1927 if it remains at flood levels through the summer. AccuWeather estimates the flooding damage along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers is already over $12bn. But, barring another system of severe storms, ""we're sort of on the downhill side, I hope"", Mr Hurst says. He adds: ""Just because we haven't had rain in a few days doesn't mean that people's homes are dry or that their farms aren't covered with water."" And some of the farms that have flooded, he says, were still dealing with damage from local flooding in 2011. As the floodwaters ebb and the acres of drowned land emerge again, a long clean-up process begins. The receding water leaves feet of sand and mud, rubbish and sewage in its wake, but it will be months yet before proper clean-up efforts can start - let alone farming. Mr Hurst says some farmers believe climate change has caused the severe weather this year, while others blame improper management of river operations. ""It doesn't matter whether our problem is caused by poor management or climate change, we need to figure out how to do better,"" he tells me. ""Having said all that: Would any kind of management of the river prevented flooding in 2019? No. There's nothing that could have prevented this."" Additional reporting by Halle Kendall","Five hundred acres of Blake Hurst's farm in Westboro, Missouri, are under water."
"The unrest entered its fifth day on Saturday, with at least five people killed in the latest clashes in the capital Baghdad. The security forces are again reported to have used live rounds. Demonstrators say they are taking a stand against unemployment, poor public services and corruption. It is the deadliest unrest since so-called Islamic State was declared defeated in Iraq in 2017. It is seen as the first major challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi's fragile government, nearly a year since he came to power. The authorities have been trying to control the protests through curfews and a near-total internet blackout. An emergency session of parliament failed to go ahead on Saturday afternoon. What's the latest? The daytime curfew in Baghdad was lifted on Saturday, and smaller groups of protesters began to renew their action. The city's Tahrir Square has been the focal point of protests, but it was blocked on Saturday, according to local news agencies. The violence has also affected majority Shia Muslim areas in the south, including Amara, Diwaniya and Hilla. A number of deaths were reported on Friday in the southern city of Nasiriya, about 320km (200 miles) away. A total of 540 protesters have been arrested, of whom nearly 200 remain in custody, the human rights commission said. It also said more than 3,000 people had been injured. The demonstrators do not appear to have any clear leadership at the moment, and their anger is increasingly radicalising their demands, says the BBC's Sebastian Usher. Read more from Iraq: What's been the reaction? On Friday, Prime Minister Mahdi vowed to respond to protesters' concerns but warned there was no ""magic solution"" to Iraq's problems. He said he had given his full backing to security forces, insisting they were abiding by ""international standards"" in dealing with protesters. Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged the government to respond to the demands for reform, saying it had ""not answered the demands of the people to fight corruption or achieved anything on the ground"". The UN and US have expressed concern over the violence, and urged the Iraqi authorities to exercise restraint. Why is this happening now? Corruption, unemployment and poor public services are at the heart of the discontent faced by young Iraqis today. The unrest began spontaneously with no formal leadership in mostly Shia areas in the south, and quickly spread. Iraq has the world's fourth-largest reserves of oil, but 22.5% of its population of 40 million were living on less than $1.90 (£1.53) a day in 2014, according to the World Bank. One in six households has experienced some form of food insecurity. The unemployment rate was 7.9% last year, but among young people it was double that. And almost 17% of the economically active population is underemployed. The country is also struggling to recover after a brutal war against the Islamic State group, which seized control of large swathes of the north and west in 2014. Living conditions remain dire in many conflict-affected areas, with insufficient services.","The death toll from anti-government protests in Iraq has risen to almost 100, says the country's parliamentary human rights commission."
"Mr Chavez left the country on 8 June for Cuba, where he had surgery, apparently for a pelvic abscess. On Tuesday Cuban state TV showed images of the president talking animatedly to former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. But on Wednesday Venezuelan officials said the summit, which he was due to host, had been delayed. Analysts say the suspension of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) meeting will be a blow to President Chavez. He was due to chair the first gathering of the new regional bloc on Margarita island, off the Venezuelan coast. Venezuelan officials had earlier said the videos from Cuba proved that the president's recovery was continuing. Extended footage of Mr Chavez and Mr Castro talking was broadcast by Cuban and Venezuelan TV on Wednesday. Vice-President Elias Jaua said Mr Chavez had been in close contact with officials in an effort to ""continue driving the national plans forward"". Mr Chavez's unexpectedly long absence from the country has prompted debate on whether he should delegate executive power to the vice-president. Venezuelan officials have said he underwent emergency surgery on 10 June for a pelvic abscess, but there has been speculation in the Venezuelan and foreign press that the president's condition could be more serious. He had been widely expected to be back in time to host the CELAC summit which also coincides with Venezuela's bicentennial celebrations. President Chavez is one of the driving forces behind CELAC, seen as an alternative to the Organization of American States (OAS). Unlike the OAS, CELAC excludes the US and Canada. The BBC's Sarah Grainger in Caracas said President Chavez wants to see greater co-operation between Latin American nations and less US influence in the region.",Venezuela has suspended a regional summit scheduled for 5 July amid continuing speculation over the health of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
"""I just watched the lights of the boat disappear. I screamed, I screamed with everything I had in my lungs, but I realised very quickly that they were never going to hear me."" Brett Archibald relives the moment he thought his life was over. At 02:30 local time on 17 April 2013, in the middle of a storm in the Indian Ocean, he had fallen overboard after passing out on the top deck of a hired boat off the coast of Indonesia. It was dark and pouring with rain. He was on a surfing holiday with nine friends, but had fallen ill from food poisoning during a 10-hour journey along a stretch of water known as the Mentawai Strait in Indonesia's West Sumatra province. He had gone to the side of the boat - the Naga Laut - to be ill overboard, when he became dizzy and blacked out. When he woke, he was in the water - the boat already 10 or 15 metres ahead of him. ""I swam with everything I could, but there was no way I was going to catch a boat,"" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Brett - then aged 50 - from Cape Town, South Africa, remembers being in complete shock. He had never imagined he would be susceptible to falling overboard. As the boat continued into the distance he remembers staring at the sky, his ears pricking up at the sound of an animalistic cry - that was coming from within. ""I thought there was a hyena in the water - it was a manic, crazy laugh. I looked around me and it was me. It was this crazy noise coming out of my throat, like hysterical laughter."" For the next 28 hours Brett was alone in the water, but determined not to succumb to the elements. As a surfer, and strong swimmer, he knew that he needed to take a deep breath and swim through any oncoming waves. He went through his book and CD collections, title by title, in his head to try to forget the unbearable cramp in his limbs - before singing to himself. He became exhausted, and started to hallucinate, but a series of events gave him the adrenalin, and the fight, to stay alive. Brett - who has written a book about the ordeal - says he invented his own form of breaststroke to keep his head above water. But as his energy dwindled, he fell asleep - only to be woken by gulls. ""This thing smacked me on the back of the head,"" he says. ""I lifted my head up to see what on earth it was and out of the blue this bird just exploded into my face. ""I felt the bridge of my nose, blood started flowing. I didn't know what had happened - I felt like someone had hit me with a baseball bat. Find out more The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. ""These two gulls were just dive-bombing me, they were coming from nowhere, squawking and screaming."" Brett believes the gulls were intent on plucking out his eyeballs, but in his crazed state of mind, his main thought was to turn the tables. ""Suddenly I thought, 'I can catch one of them and I can eat him'. ""I thought I could actually pluck one of them out of the air, bite its head off and eat him. I would have eaten that thing feathers and all at that stage."" It was, of course, a plan that went unfulfilled, but it was not Brett's only encounter with life out in the ocean. 'It's a shark' Around 15 hours after first falling overboard - by Brett's best estimate - he felt a bump to the back of his left kidney. ""I thought it was a barracuda initially, this big fish. Then the thing nudged me again and actually turned me in the water and I thought 'oh it's a shark, I know it's a shark'."" As he was flipped around, he caught a glimpse of what at the time seemed like ""the size of a red bus in London"". ""It's weird the human mind. My first thought was 'oh he's going to eat me'. I remember lifting my throat and saying 'buddy, just rip my throat out'."" Then he noticed the black edgings of its vertical fin - it was a blacktip reef shark. As a keen surfer in South Africa, where the shark also resides, he knew it did not pose a threat to humans. His mind quickly turned to a new survival hope. ""I thought 'I could catch this guy and he could tow me to a reef'. ""I started in my mind plotting. I even used the words 'Bear Grylls, take off your mask, here comes Archie. I'm going to catch you [shark] and I'm going to tow you to land'."" But then, something very simple happened. It should have brought Brett utter relief, but instead left him distraught and bereft of hope. The shark swam away. ""I've never been so devastated in my life. It was the closest I came to crying, because it was the first time I'd found something that I thought could save my life."" Looking back, he can only describe the mentality as ""absolutely crazy"". It was a further 13 hours before he was discovered, around 20 kilometres from where he had fallen overboard the previous day. After his friends saw he had not arrived for breakfast they had contacted the Indonesian coastguard, who co-ordinated a search and rescue effort. Other nearby vessels joined in, and at around 6.30am local time, a Sydney couple aboard a boat known as the Barrenjoey spotted him in the water, miraculously still alive. Shaking and in pain - his eyes swollen and his feet, lips and hands nearly bloodless - he was rescued and taken for a medical assessment nearby. He had lost nearly 13lb (6kg) in weight in the water. Thoughts of his family - his wife and children aged six and nine at the time - had pulled him through, he says. He remembers at one point saying out loud: ""I'm fighting, I'm hanging in there for you"" from the water. Three years on, he says he still shudders each time he goes to the water's edge, but - quite remarkably - still calls the sea his ""happy place"". The very next day after his ordeal Brett was back on his surfboard to ride the waves, which he still enjoys to this day. ""I knew I just had to get back in the ocean. If I hadn't, I never would have gone back in again.""","When Brett Archibald fell overboard in the middle of a stormy night in the Indian Ocean he thought he was going to die. For more than 28 hours he was alone at sea, encountering a shark and being attacked by gulls for his eyeballs. Here is his story."
"By Andrea GliotiBBC Monitoring In Manbij, in northern Syria, war-weariness seems to prevail over politics. Most residents long for stability after witnessing various groups wage fierce battles for control of the town since the start of Syrian civil war. In 2012, rebel groups drove out security forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Two years later, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) seized control. And in 2016, the town was captured by a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Now, Manbij finds itself in the crosshairs once again. The Turkish government has long threatened to launch an assault to force the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - to withdraw from the predominantly Arab town and move east of the River Euphrates. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades, and sees the militia's presence along its southern border as a security threat. The Turkish military was dissuaded from attacking Manbij, which is about 30km (20 miles) from the border, by the presence of troops from a US-led multinational coalition, which has relied on the SDF to battle IS militants on the ground in northern and eastern Syria. But the situation changed on 19 December, when US President Donald Trump declared victory over IS and announced that US military personnel would begin withdrawing from Syria immediately. The decision came as a surprise to the SDF, who warned that a US pull-out would allow IS to ""revive itself again"" and ""create a political and military vacuum in the area, leaving its people between the claws of hostile parties"". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was not in a hurry to carry out an operation in Manbij, but activists reported that reinforcements had been sent to the border and a nearby Syrian area controlled by Turkish-backed rebel factions. Fearing an attack, the SDF called on the Syrian government to step in. On 28 December, the Syrian army said its troops had entered the town. But the reality turned out to be different, with troops and allied militiamen remaining stationed to the south. On Wednesday, the state news agency Sana reported that almost 400 Kurdish fighters had withdrawn from Manbij in line with an agreement, but residents told the BBC that the Kurdish-led administration was still firmly in control. ""If the regime enters Manbij it will do it through armed tribal militias. Big tribes such as al-Boubana are supportive of the regime,"" says Ali, the engineer. Ali, who is an Arab, says the current administration has ""brought us stability"", but he believes negotiations are ""the best option"" for the town. There are some residents, though, who would prefer to see Turkish-backed rebels take control. They include Arabs who have accused Kurdish fighters and officials of discrimination and human rights abuses over the past two years. People who have opposed President Assad's rule or dodged conscription to the Syrian army over the past seven years could also face being prosecuted or drafted under government rule. However, the actions of rebel factions when they controlled Manbij between 2012 and 2014 have left other people wary of their return. ""Some support the regime as they are more worried about the opposition. Others are driven by their personal interests or political beliefs,"" says one Kurdish resident. ""Most people just want the end of the war."" All residents are now waiting anxiously for outside powers to decide the town's fate. US National Security Adviser John Bolton is due to arrive in Ankara on Monday to discuss Syria with Turkish officials, while President Trump has reportedly agreed to give the US military four months to withdraw the 2,000 troops in Syria, rather than the 30 days he initially decreed. ""As long as the [US-led] coalition troops are there, neither Syria nor Turkey will intervene,"" says another local Arab, who used to work as a journalist.","""Each time this town gets back on its feet a new faction turns it into rubble,"" says Ali, a 35-year-old agricultural engineer. ""We are tired of war."""
"Ilham Tohti had spoken out on China's policies towards the Muslim Uighur minority in the restive Xinjiang region, but had denied being a separatist. Correspondents say China is taking a tougher line amid rising Xinjiang-linked violence. Amnesty International has called the verdict ""deplorable"". The EU, US and the United Nations have all previously called for his release. The Urumqi People's Intermediate Court found Tohti guilty after a two-day trial that ended last week. It also ordered all of Tohti's money and property seized. His lawyer, Li Fangping, told BBC Chinese that he would be filing an appeal. ""He told us that no matter the verdict, he will not be angry nor seek revenge. No matter whether he is in jail or if he is freed in the future, he will still advocate for dialogue between Uighurs and Han Chinese,"" he said. Carrie Gracie, China Editor, BBC News ""I won't give in."" The last words Ilham Tohti uttered before police dragged him from a courtroom to start a life sentence for attempting to divide China. Calling for independence is illegal and always punished severely when the offender belongs to China's minority Uighur community. But what is so extraordinary about the sentence is that Ilham Tohti was not an independence activist, far less a terrorist, but an outspoken advocate of building bridges between the two communities. Until his arrest in January he was an academic at a university in the capital and a member of the Communist Party. In his academic essays and on the website he ran, he insisted that Xinjiang should remain part of China and frequently expressed revulsion against growing violence employed by Uighurs against the state. But he likewise criticised the mounting police crackdown in Xinjiang, complaining that punitive policies were radicalising young Uighurs and convincing them that the battle was not between China and terrorists, but between China and Islam. Today's life sentence is a message that amid the battle to contain Xinjiang's surging violence, there is no longer room in China for an outspoken moderate. 'Deplorable' In recent years Xinjiang has seen rising tensions between Uighurs and Han Chinese migrants, and observers say the sentence could further stoke tensions. Tohti was detained in January after he criticised Beijing's heavy response to a suicide car attack near Tiananmen Square carried out by Uighurs from Xinjiang. Prosecutors at the trial alleged he was engaging in separatist activities including promoting independence on his website, according to his lawyers. A spokesman for the exiled World Uyghur Congress said Tohti was being persecuted. ""China has sent a clear message...thoroughly disappointing all those who hope to use the legal process or reasonable proposals to change the status quo of Uighurs,"" said Dilxat Raxit in an emailed statement to Reuters news agency. Uighurs and Xinjiang Who are the Uighurs? Human rights group Amnesty International said the verdict was an ""affront to justice"" and full of legal shortcomings. ""His legal team were refused access to evidence and they were unable to meet Tohti for six months. One of Tohti's lawyers was also forced to quit the case following political pressure,"" the group said. Liu Xiaoyuan, a lawyer for Tohti, told the BBC that several foreign embassies were not allowed into the court to witness the proceedings.","A court in China has found a prominent Uighur scholar guilty of separatism and jailed him for life, his lawyer says."
"Supermac's, which owns more than 100 fast food restaurants in Ireland, complained to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO ruled McDonald's had not proved genuine use of the ""Mc"" prefix on some of the products it trademarked. It is Supermac's second partial victory this year in the EU branding dispute. 'McBully' However, the EUIPO upheld McDonald's right to own the ""Mc"" trademark on chicken nuggets and some of its sandwich products. The ruling also stated that as both firms had succeeded in some parts of the case and failed on others, each party must pay its own costs. Supermac's was founded by Galway businessman Pat McDonagh in 1978 and is now the largest Irish-owned fast food restaurant firm in the Republic of Ireland. Mr McDonagh, who previously referred to his global fast food rival as ""McBully,"" said the latest ruling was a ""victory for small businesses"". ""The Mc is back,"" he declared in a company statement. ""McDonald's tried to argue that because they had some products that started with Mc, that the term Mc was so synonymous with them, that they had the right to own and trademark Mc,"" he added. ""We are delighted that the EUIPO found in our favour and that we can now say that we have rid Europe of the McDonald's self-styled monopoly of the term Mc."" 'Core menu items' However, a statement from McDonald's pointed out that the EUIPO ruling had reinforced its ownership of the Mc trademark on a selection of its fast food products. ""The EUIPO upheld McDonald's EU registration for the trademark ""Mc"" standing alone for certain core menu items which McDonald's uses in connection with its famous family of Mc-prefixed trademarks,"" the US firm's statement said. ""This decision does not impact McDonald's ability to use its Mc-prefixed trademarks or other trademarks throughout Europe and the world, and McDonald's will continue to enforce its rights."" Supermac's took the case after a branding dispute halted the Irish company's attempts to expand its restaurant chain into the UK and Europe. Long-running dispute McDonald's had won an earlier battle over the similarity between the name Supermac's and the Big Mac. Supermac's then asked the EUIPO to rule on the issue and the Irish firm won a partial victory in January 2019. At that time, the EUIPO ruled that McDonald's had not proved genuine use of the trademarked term ""Big Mac"" as a burger or restaurant name. The latest EUIPO ruling revokes McDonald's automatic trademark rights to the use of the term ""Mc"" on a long list of food products, drinks and restaurant services within the EU. However, the EU body upheld the US firm's right to own the ""Mc"" trademark on chicken nuggets and a range of its sandwich products including meat, fish, pork and chicken sandwiches. 'Common surnames' McDonald's had argued that due to its long and continuous use of the 'Mc' term, the trademark had become widely and exclusively associated with McDonald's by EU consumers. The US firm also pointed to several earlier decisions in its favour issued by courts and trade mark offices throughout Europe. But Supermac's argued that 'Mc' was a ""very common prefix for surnames throughout Ireland, the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the European Union"". It pointed out that there were a huge number of pubs, hotels, restaurants, and food products which contain the prefix 'Mc' as part of a surname. The Irish firm claimed that McDonald's had never used the prefix 'Mc' in a standalone sense, but only in combination with other words to brand their products. ""It is not a 'Mc' chicken sandwich, it is a 'McChicken' sandwich,"" the document states. The EUIPO agreed with Supermac's that there was no evidence of use of the contested trademark 'Mc' alone, but ""only accompanied by further elements"".","McDonald's has lost its exclusive claim to the ""Mc"" trademark on some of its food products within the EU after a dispute with an Irish fast food chain."
"She told a French-language newspaper she was struggling to balance her schedule only having one staff member. ""I'd love to be everywhere but I can't,"" she said. ""I have three children and a husband who is prime minister."" Some are ridiculing her for what they perceived as pretentious comments. What exactly was her complaint? She told Le Soleil newspaper that she is ""flooded with requests"" for appearances and projects and that she does not have the time to do it all. ""It's hard to choose because it is affecting the people who want your help,"" she said. ""You say to yourself: I will try to convey a message that will reach as many people as possible."" ""There is always a price to pay, but the price shouldn't be as high,"" she said of balancing work and family. She made the comments while promoting an organisation for active and healthy lifestyles. In her youth, she suffered with eating disorders, she told the newspaper, and she wants to help young women build self-confidence. How did people react? Canadians on Twitter started a hashtag, #PrayForSophie, to poke fun at her request, with some people even drawing comparisons between the Trudeaus and the Kardashians. ""I'm setting up a lemonade stand this weekend, all proceeds going to fund help for Sophie,"" one person tweeted. Opposition politicians in Canada called Ms Gregoire Trudeau out of touch and pointed out that previous prime ministers' wives dealt with only having one personal aide. Tory MP Candice Bergen said Canadian families are struggling financially and questioned how the government could afford to hire another assistant. Another Tory MP, Jason Kenney, said former prime minister Stephen Harper's wife, Laureen, never complained. ""Harpers paid for babysitters, not taxpayers,"" he tweeted. ""And they didn't inherit millions. Nor did Laureen whinge about it."" Did anyone come to her defence? A Toronto Star editorial argues that she should have the help she needs to fulfil her role. The conversation should shift to what is expected of the spouse of a prime minister in Canada, the newspaper writes. ""It should come as no surprise that the demands on her are greater than those on previous PMs' wives,"" the editorial reads, pointing out that previous PM's wives have had one or multiple assistants. ""Justin Trudeau is riding a wave of popularity that extends to his entire family, especially his wife."" ""It should be noted that Gregoire Trudeau is not asking for another employee to lessen her workload, but to increase it. She lamented that because she doesn't have enough staff she is forced to make difficult choices about who she can help."" Mr Trudeau himself came to his wife's defence, sharing a letter on Facebook written by a woman supporting his wife. ""I don't know what it's like to be you, and because of this I support you,"" the letter reads. ""I know there are others like me out there, but the loudest voices in any conversation are always the angry ones."" The prime minister's office is looking into hiring another aide, federal officials told the Globe and Mail. Government House leader Dominic LeBlanc also defended her. ""It's no secret that Ms Gregoire Trudeau is asked to attend an enormous number of events,"" Mr LeBlanc said. ""She's participated in a whole series of very worthy causes. So we find that a perfectly appropriate conversation to have - Does she have the adequate support to undertake these official functions?"" How does her role differ from First Lady in the US? In the US, First Lady is a formal role within the executive office, with its own headquarters in the White House and staff, including but not limited to a social secretary, a chief of staff, a press secretary and a chef. In Canada, the wife of the prime minister has no formal status and no personal office, but as the Toronto Star editorial notes, Canadians expect the PM's spouse to play a ""significant public role"", with the opportunity to represent Canada and promote causes. Men are rarely asked about their domestic life and how they balance it, Suzanne Moore writes in the Guardian. ""Gregoire Trudeau has indeed committed a crime - against this fairytale that so many women are burdened with by simply telling the truth: 'I need help'.""","Canadians are debating the role of the prime minister's wife after Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said she wants to do more for the country but ""needs help""."
"The 2015 Travel Survey showed that only 13,100 business visitors came for a day in 2015, compared to 21,600 in 2014 - a drop of 39%. Overall, there were 11,000 fewer business visitors last year. Tony Rowbotham, chairman of Guernsey's Chamber of Commerce, said it was ""massively disappointing"" and blamed ""uncompetitive"" transport links. Visitor numbers stable He said: ""We are price uncompetitive on our flights compared with our jurisdictions and that's the feedback we've been getting for the past two years. ""Chamber members [say] they are finding it difficult to get clients to come here; those clients feel we are too expensive and expense is comparative, whether you like it or not, we are compared against other jurisdictions."" The survey showed visitor numbers were up annually by 0.8% on 2014, but down by 7.8% in the final quarter.

"He made the comments at the Obama Foundation's annual summit in Chicago on Tuesday. Mr Obama said that calling people out on social media did not bring about change, and that change was complex. ""Woke"" is described as being alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice, along with being aware of what's going on in the community. Mr Obama told the audience: ""I get a sense among certain young people on social media that the way of making change is to be as judgemental as possible about other people. ""If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself because 'Man did you see how woke I was? I called you out!'"" ""That's enough,"" he said. ""If all you're doing is casting stones, you are probably not going to get that far."" Mr Obama added that ""people who do really good stuff have flaws"". His comments come as Democrats prepare for the 2020 presidential nomination race. So far, there has been a focus on how ""woke"" candidates are, with a number apologising for past incidents. Before withdrawing from the race, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand went on television to apologise for using the term ""illegal alien"" in the past. Elizabeth Warren has apologised for identifying as Native American, while Pete Buttigieg has apologised for his use of the phrase ""all lives matter"". It isn't the first time Mr Obama has raised the issue. Last April, he told a crowd at an Obama Foundation event in Berlin: ""One of the things I do worry about among progressives in the United States, maybe it's true here as well, is a certain kind of rigidity where we say 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be' and then we start sometimes creating what's called a 'circular firing squad', where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues."" Jen Psaki, former Obama White House communications director, told CNN that she believed Mr Obama's most recent comments were a message for the Democratic Party and those running for election. ""If we are launching purity tests, we are going to have such a small party and will not be able to win. Governing is not about saying: 'You don't agree with me, then you can't be part of the conversation.'""","Former US President Barack Obama has challenged ""woke"" culture telling young people: ""The world is messy."""
"Surveillance footage from Sunday's incident shows a metal panel at the top of the escalator giving way, causing the woman and her toddler to stumble. The woman, identified by local media as Xiang Liujuan, 30, was able to push her child to safety as she fell in. The incident in Jingzhou, in Hubei province, has sparked widespread anger at the department store. The woman fell into the escalator at 10:09 local time (02:09 GMT) on Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV and newspaper Wuhan Evening News reported. Employees standing at the top of the escalators tried to pull the woman to safety, but were unable to stop her from being pulled in. It took until 14:00 for rescuers to retrieve her body, CCTV said. There was no immediate comment from the shopping centre, but local authorities are investigating the incident, media reports said. Unconfirmed reports said that maintenance works had been carried out on the escalator recently, and workmen had replaced the metal panel but forgotten to secure it with screws, Wuhan Evening News said. The incident has sparked fury on Chinese social media, with many demanding answers from the shopping centre's management. As of Monday morning, microblog posts on the subject had attracted more than 20 million views. One user called for the department store to temporarily suspend operations, while another demanded: ""Where were the screws to secure the panel? If the screws had been removed why didn't they shut down the escalator? What brand was that escalator?"" ""This is heartbreaking!"" User Maqi Yaduo wrote. ""Why didn't store employees cordon off or shut down the escalator? The department store definitely bears responsibility for this."" Many paid tribute to the mother for ensuring her child was safe. ""When I saw her fall in I felt awful - but at the same time I felt how strong a mother's love can be - during such a sudden event, the mother's first reaction was still to push the child away from the gap,"" user I am a Promising Youth said. Others expressed concerns about safety standards in China. ""I used to think only lifts would kill people - now it looks like escalators aren't safe either,"" user Wang Wentao wrote. ""Next time I'm on an escalator, I'll jump across [the top]."" China has seen several escalator-related accidents in recent years, including an escalator in Shanghai that suddenly reversed direction in 2014, injuring 13 people, and a Beijing escalator that malfunctioned in 2011, killing a teenage boy.","A woman was killed after falling into an escalator in a shopping centre in central China, local media report."
"The migrants, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, must then undergo health checks, Italian officials said. The German rescue vessel, Alan Kurdi, has been refused access to Italian and Maltese ports over coronavirus fears. Italy's transport ministry said the move was necessary because Sicily's health services were already stretched. Allowing the migrants to disembark from the Alan Kurdi ship, operated by the German humanitarian group Sea-Eye, would put too much pressure on the island's local authorities, Italy's civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said. As of Sunday, Italy as a whole had reported 19,899 coronavirus deaths and more than 156,363 confirmed infections. The country reported 431 deaths over a 24-hour period - the lowest daily rise in more than three weeks. Mr Borrelli signed a document on Sunday ordering the Coast Guard, with the assistance of the Italian Red Cross, to provide a ship ""in the next few hours"" to quarantine and test the 156 migrants near Italian territorial waters, local media report. No decision has been made about the final destination of the migrants, who were rescued from small boats in distress off the Libyan coast, officials said. Italy has previously said that migrants rescued and brought to its shores become the responsibility of the European Union (EU) and should be fairly distributed among member states. Sea-Eye has also called on EU leaders to find a more permanent solution to the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. Earlier this month, the EU's top court - the European Court of Justice - ruled that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had broken EU law by refusing to take in refugees under an agreement to ease the burden faced by Italy and Greece. In Greece, a number of migrant facilities were recently quarantined after residents tested positive for coronavirus. Aid groups have warned that an outbreak of Covid-19 at overcrowded camps - where sanitation is poor - could allow the virus to spread quickly. There have so far been no confirmed cases of the virus in camps on five Greek islands, where roughly half of all EU asylum seekers live.",Italy has ordered 156 migrants on board a German rescue ship off the western coast of Sicily to be transferred to another vessel and quarantined.

"In early 2014 Crimea became the focus of the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War, after Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power by violent protests in Kiev. Kremlin-backed forces seized control of the Crimean peninsula, and the territory, which has a Russian-speaking majority, voted to join Russia in a referendum that Ukraine and the West deem illegal. Crimea was annexed by the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine The Great in 1783 and remained part of Russia until 1954, when it was transferred to Ukraine under the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Ethnic Russians make up the majority of the population, but with significant Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities. Under Greek and Roman influence for centuries, in 1443 Crimea became the centre of a Tatar Khanate, which later fell under Ottoman control. Rival imperial ambitions in the mid 19th century led to the Crimean War when Britain and France, suspicious of Russian ambitions in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire declined, sent troops. Given autonomous republic status within Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, Crimea was occupied by the Nazis in the early 1940s. Tatar deportation Stalin accused the Tatars of collaborating with the German occupiers and deported them en masse to Central Asia and Siberia in 1944. Many did not survive. Only as the Soviet Union collapsed were they allowed to return. By the time over a quarter of a million did so in the early 1990s, it was to an independent Ukraine where they faced very high unemployment and extremely poor housing conditions. There were persistent tensions and protests over land rights, and allocation of land to Crimean Tatars was a contentious issue. After Ukrainian independence, political figures from the local Russian community sought to assert sovereignty and strengthen ties with Russia through a series of moves declared unconstitutional by the Ukrainian government. The 1996 Ukrainian constitution stipulated that Crimea would have autonomous republic status, but insisted that Crimean legislation must be in keeping with that of Ukraine. Crimea has its own parliament and government with powers over agriculture, public infrastructure and tourism. The Crimean Tatars have their own unofficial parliament, the Mejlis, which states its purpose as being to promote the rights and interests of the Crimean Tatars. Ukraine-Russia tension The port of Sevastopol is a major naval base and has been home to the Black Sea Fleet since 1783. Following the collapse of the USSR, the fleet was divided up between Russia and Ukraine. The continuing presence of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol has been a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. In 2008, Ukraine - then under the pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko - demanded that Moscow not use the Black Sea Fleet during the its conflict with Georgia. Both countries had agreed to allow the Russian fleet to stay until 2017, but after the election of the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych as president in 2010, Ukraine agreed to extend the lease by 25 years beyond 2017, in return for cheaper Russian gas.","The Republic of Crimea, officially part of Ukraine, lies on a peninsula stretching out from the south of Ukraine between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.

"Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst - dubbed the ""Luxury Bishop"" - is facing calls for his resignation after spending 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on his residence. He is also accused of lying about the over-spend on the property in Limburg. In Rome, he will meet the head of the Catholic Church in Germany, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch. It is not clear if Pope Francis will intervene. Since taking office in March, Pope Francis has urged the Church to promote a lifestyle of frugality and simplicity. The allegations have stoked controversy among Catholics in Germany, where Martin Luther launched the Reformation in Europe five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church. Active German Catholics also pay a tax to the Church as part of their income tax, and many are shocked by the apparent financial waste - prompting some to stage demonstrations outside the bishop's residence in Limburg, a town in Hesse near Frankfurt-on-Main. ""The bishop has made it clear that any decision about his service as a bishop lies in the hands of the Holy Father (Pope Francis),"" said a statement issued by the diocese on Saturday. ""The bishop is saddened by the escalation of the current discussion. He sees and regrets that many believers are suffering under the current situation,"" it said. 'Sounds frightening' Bishop Tebartz-van Elst is also accused of twice lying under oath about a flight he took to India on a trip to visit poor children. The 53-year-old had filed a civil court claim against Der Spiegel magazine, which is based in Hamburg, for reporting that he had flown first-class on the trip. After being forced to print a retraction, the magazine filed a legal complaint of its own. As evidence, it published mobile phone video (in German) of its interview with Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, in which he clearly stated that he had flown business class. Asked by the German daily Bild about the high cost of his new residence, the bishop said: ""I understand that the high cost of 31m euros sounds frightening. Those who know me know that I don't have a pompous lifestyle."" Archbishop Zollitsch said he had set up a commission to investigate the finances of Limburg diocese. He said he would ""speak to the Holy Father and the relevant people"" about the issue in Rome.",A German bishop has flown - reportedly with a budget airline - to the Vatican in Rome to discuss his lavish spending.
"In an announcement on Wednesday, President Waheed Hassan's office said that this was the earliest date allowed by the constitution. Former president Mohamed Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) criticised the move, saying elections should be held in 2012. Mr Nasheed, who quit in February, says he was removed from office by force. On Monday, the Commonwealth's human rights watchdog had reiterated its call for Mr Waheed's government to hold polls before the end of 2012. Mr Nasheed resigned as president on 7 February amid unrest over the arrest of a senior judge. He said at the time that he was stepping down to prevent ""bloodshed"", but later claimed that he was forced to do so at gunpoint.

"Mr Turnbull, himself a republican, said momentum must come from the public, and that he did not want to face another ""heroic defeat"" in a referendum. His comments, on Australia Day, come amid mounting pressure on the government to restart the debate. The new Australian of the Year, ex-army chief David Morrison, has said it is time to ""have the conversation"". In his acceptance speech on Monday night, Lt Gen Morrison said the time was right to ""at least revisit the question so that we can stand both free and fully independent amongst the community of nations"". His speech came hours after all but one of of Australia's state and territory leaders signed a document in support of dropping the Queen as head of state. Critics have said republicans have yet to propose a viable alternative to being a constitutional monarchy. 'Timing has to be right' Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum. Mr Turnbull - who was leading the republican movement at that time - said he had ""no doubt in the future there will be another referendum, and the matter will be decided, as it should be, by the Australian people"". ""But the timing of that referendum has to be right,"" he said, repeating his view that it should not take place until the end of the Queen's reign. ""I've led the 'yes' case for a republic into a heroic defeat once, I've got no desire to do so again,"" he told reporters at an Australia Day event in Canberra. Lt Gen Morrison was named Australian of the Year at a ceremony in Canberra on Monday in recognition of his commitment to gender equality.

"Their evidence, obtained from the cockpit voice recorder and other information outlines in more detail how co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28, brought down the Airbus. So how did this final half hour unfold? Germanwings flight 4U 9525 took off from Barcelona Airport in Spain heading for Duesseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board, at 09:00 GMT on 24 March. The Airbus 320 began travelling over the sea towards France, taking about half an hour to climb to 38,000ft (11,600m). It should have been a two-hour flight and, in the first 20 minutes, the pilots could be heard discussing the stop-over at Barcelona with a flight attendant. At 09:30 the plane made its final contact with air traffic control - a routine message about permission to continue on its route. Everything seemed to be going as planned. Shortly afterwards, the captain told the co-pilot he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications. The cockpit door is heard opening and closing on the recording. Seconds later, shortly before 09:31, the selected altitude was changed from 38,000 ft to 100 ft and the plane began its descent. At 09:33, the plane's speed increased. Air traffic control contacted the co-pilot - and continued to do so over the coming minutes - but received no answer. A buzzer requesting access to the cockpit sounded at 09:34. Knocking and muffled voices asking for the door to be opened can be heard until the end of the recording. At 09:39, ""noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions"" over the course of a minute. The flight crew of another plane also tried to make contact with the cockpit by radio around this time. In the next minute - 93 seconds before impact - ""low amplitude inputs"" on the co-pilot's flight controls were recorded. But the level of movement was too low to disengage the autopilot, so the input made no change to the flight path. The ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull up"" warning was triggered at 09:40: 41 and it continues until the end of the recording at 09:41:06. French prosecutor Brice Robin gave details of events on board the Airbus when he briefed journalists after the cockpit voice recorder was analysed in the days after the crash. During the first 20 minutes of the flight, he said, the co-pilot's responses were courteous but he became ""curt"" when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing. It was shortly after this that the captain left the cockpit, probably to go to the toilet, and within seconds Lubitz had altered the flight monitoring system to send the aircraft into descent. ""This action on the altitude controls can only be deliberate,"" said Mr Robin. In the 10 minutes it took for the plane to plummet through the sky, Lubitz did not say a word and his breathing remained normal - despite repeated attempts by crew members and air traffic control to get him to respond. The Airbus descended at a rate of about 3-4,000ft per minute. The last radar contact was at 09.40:47 GMT at 6,175ft. During the very last moment of the recording passengers can be heard screaming. Mr Robin said he believed they were unaware of what was happening in the cockpit up until this point. The plane hit the mountain at 700km/h (430mph) an hour. ""Death was instant,"" he added.","French accident investigators released their final report into Germanwings Flight 4U 9525, which crashed in the Alps in March 2015, about a year later."
"Mark UrbanDiplomatic and defence editor, BBC Newsnight The foreign ministers and envoys once again have to apply their wits trying to unravel that Gordian knot of international affairs since 1948, the Israeli-Palestinian issue. So, US Secretary of State John Kerry talks about the urgent need to clarify the status of Jerusalem's holy places, while last week the French canvassed support in the UN Security Council for a new initiative, while all the time the death toll climbed in Israel and the occupied territories. On Thursday, there are plans for Mr Kerry to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Berlin. What are they going to talk about these statesmen and women? What value can there be, going to and fro, when so many different approaches have been tried before and failed? Isn't the new Palestinian uprising, or intifada, fundamentally an upsurge of frustration with the hopelessness of it all? We have some idea what these new approaches involve - but let's park that for a moment, because whatever people have in mind, it remains a fiendishly hard problem. Having covered the search for a solution for the past 25 years, I can remember only too well the many different ways that were tried. Back in 1991, a ""comprehensive approach"" was attempted at the Madrid Conference, with the idea that Israel should make peace with all its neighbours at once, resolving at the same time the Palestinian refugee issue. Diplomats later abandoned this grandiose concept and tried incremental approaches in more recent years, from ""Gaza First"", to ""Virtual Palestinian Statehood"". The idea was to work on what seemed achievable rather than get deadlocked on the most intractable final status issues (principally the question of Jerusalem and fate of Palestinian refugees). Perhaps the most successful phase of peacemaking, the Oslo Agreement of 1993, involved a combination of these approaches, moving forward with a raft of Palestinian self-rule measures in Gaza and the West Bank, while pledging to resolve those intractable questions at the heart of the conflict later. Both the Israeli far right and the militant Islamists of Hamas rejected the Oslo approach. And in 2000, when the second Intifada broke out, it died and thousands of lives were lost. One of the widespread assumptions of negotiations back then was that the US would have to deliver Israel for a peace deal, and the EU and certain Arab states would have to get the Palestinians on board. But all of this looks very problematic now - Mr Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama are hardly on speaking terms after Israel's abortive attempts to halt the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, many of the biggest donors to the Palestinian cause have held up cash intended to rebuild Gaza because of the failure of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority to move ahead with a process of reconciliation aimed at ending their near decade-long feud. Without progress towards a working unity government, Palestinian participation in talks is problematic. With things looking so bad, both Mr Netanyahu and senior Palestinian figures had started to flirt in recent years with abandoning the ""two-state solution"" or partition of disputed lands, and hint instead at a unitary state, each side implying it would hold the upper hand. Seven months ago, Mr Netanyahu seemed to go back on a 2009 commitment to a Palestinian state, saying it had been given before turmoil engulfed the Arab world and that as of 2015, ""any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists"". Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, meanwhile, has focused efforts on taking Israel to the International Criminal Court for its 2014 campaign in Gaza, trying to halt settlement activity and drawing attention to what he characterises as Israeli attacks on Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. Some background to the conflict After a period of relative quiet, violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. They were fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter a long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank and the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other's communities. What's behind the latest unrest? Profile: Benjamin Netanyahu Profile: Mahmoud Abbas Israel - timeline Palestinian territories - timeline So where can peace brokers possibly go from here? In the first place, they are attempting to calm tensions over the al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock, Federica Mogherini, the EU's top envoy, tweeting last week: ""Respect for holy sites key"". A French proposal at the UN for an international monitoring group to go into Jerusalem's Old City in order to ease tensions at these sites was rejected on Sunday by Israel. US diplomacy, for its part, has been leaning on Mr Abbas, urging him to condemn the recent wave of stabbings by Palestinians. Mr Kerry hopes to see the Israeli leader later this week (though it's possible Mr Netanyahu may postpone his Berlin trip if security deteriorates further) and Mr Abbas in Jordan at the weekend. These planned meetings though are about containing the current violence, not grand designs for the future. With the US moving into election season, and President Obama apparently uninterested in hazarding what remains of his presidency on Middle East peacemaking, the French see an opening. Their proposal on Jerusalem was designed to reassure both Muslim and Jewish people that recent incitement about possible changes to the status quo is unfounded, and limit further clashes. France has also been working on Security Council initiatives aimed at halting Israeli settlement construction and advancing Palestinian statehood. Since the US and EU are consistently trying to prevent Israel from backsliding on the two-state approach to peace, Mr Netanyahu has not repeated the kind of language he used during his election campaign. In fact, last month at the UN General Assembly he said: ""I remain committed to a vision of two states for two peoples."" Oded Eran, onetime head of the Israeli negotiating team with the Palestinians, says the prime minister is to be believed, but that the two-state option is unattainable for the time being, ""the current domestic political circumstances in Israel and the instability in the region make this proposition very unrealistic"". Given that continued expansion of Jewish settlements complicates any eventual two-state solution, foreign negotiators will want to hold Mr Netanyahu's feet to the fire on this, urging a freeze. Ari Shavit, a liberal Israeli commentator and author of My Promised Land, says continuing the settlement project, is ""a suicide option"" for Israel and urges the resumption of step-by-step peacemaking, including a settlement freeze on the West Bank and a project to increase Gaza's water supply. However, stopping this construction, let alone territorial concessions, are anathema to many of Mr Netanyahu's right-wing allies, so the question is whether the outside world can exert any leverage. Mustapha Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator and onetime minister says the ""only way to have two-state solution is to change the balance of power"", and argues that American pressure on Israel is essential for that. This is a familiar refrain among Palestinians, but America's role seems diminished, at least for the time being. Israel's allies in Congress will make sure the Jewish state's arms supplies are not cut off, while the administration sees more urgent problems in Syria and a positive legacy in its Iran agreement. Increasingly, it is within the EU that the key discussions about the Middle East peace process occur. Many countries favour tougher action against Israel, including changes to its favourable trading terms, but they have generally been blocked by the UK and Germany. On this question, as on so many others these days, Germany and the person of Chancellor Angela Merkel are now of central importance. Hence Mr Netanyahu's planned visit this week to Berlin. Germany's traditionally pro-Israeli stance has been shifting, particularly since the 2014 Gaza campaign. A growth in Germany's Muslim population, not least through the acceptance of hundreds of thousands of refugees, may also have an effect, long term. Even so, Oded Eran assesses that the EU ""will not impose trade sanctions capable of changing dramatically Israel's policies"". If the international community is to coalesce on this issue - and it's still a big ""if"" given that Syria's tragedy and its resulting refugee crisis are more central to the concerns of most foreign ministries - the key shifts, at least until a new US president is elected, are likely to take place in the Europe. If France uses its place in the Security Council and Germany its leading role in the EU, pressure could soon build, particularly on Israel, for the meaningful steps back towards a two-state solution.

"The talks, held on Tuesday, were the first in two years and led to the announcement that North Korea would send a delegation to the Olympics in Pyeongchang later this year. Mr Moon said he wanted to show Mr Trump his gratitude. The US president tweeted a week ago that he had brought the talks about. He said he had done so by being ""firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North"". Mr Moon told reporters on Wednesday: ""I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks. ""It could be a resulting work of the US-led sanctions and pressure,"" he said. Later on Wednesday, a lone North Korean representative arrived at the International Olympic Committee headquarters in Switzerland to formalise the agreement to send athletes to the 2018 Games. BBC correspondents in Seoul say Mr Moon is treading a difficult diplomatic line between wanting dialogue with the North but not wanting to annoy the US, an ally, or undermine economic sanctions. Russia's foreign ministry welcomed the agreements reached to negotiate over military issues. ""We hope that their implementation will serve to de-escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula and foster stability in this region,"" the ministry said. A lull in tensions for the Olympics Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Mr Moon's statement in itself is an indication of the difficult line he has to walk. It is not impossible that Mr Trump's tougher line has indeed encouraged Pyongyang to test the diplomatic waters. But can these inter-Korean talks provide a starting point for tackling more fundamental problems like the North's nuclear programme? Two things are clear. North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear arsenal and it will need more tests to prove its capability. And the US insists that Pyongyang will not be allowed to develop a capability to strike at the continental United States. So the warming of ties between the two Koreas may provide a lull in tensions for the duration of the Olympics, but what then? Mr Trump has previously said he would be willing to sit down with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the future, under the right conditions. Moon Jae-in underlined his commitment to a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons a day after the talks. North Korea, however, refused to discuss nuclear matters, though it did agree to improving military contacts. North Korea and South Korea are technically still at war with each other but at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, gymnasts from the two countries were hailed for capturing the spirit of the Games when they posed together for a selfie. What happened at Tuesday's talks? Officials from South Korea reported that:","South Korea's President Moon Jae-in says his US counterpart, Donald Trump, ""deserves big credit"" for talks between South and North Korea."

Mr Unsworth's lawyer Lin Wood said the award would be a ""hard slap on the wrist"" for the Tesla co-founder. Calling Mr Musk, 48, a ""billionaire bully"" in his closing statement, Mr Wood told the court that his client's modest life had been upended by the very public row. ""He dropped a nuclear bomb on Vernon Unsworth,"" he said, adding that the ""fallout"" would impact on him for the rest of his life. Mr Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, responded that the tweets were the result of an argument between the two men. ""In arguments you insult people,"" Mr Spiro said. ""There is no bomb. No bomb went off."" How did the row start? The case of the Thai boys, members of a football team who were trapped deep inside a cave in northern Thailand, captured the world's attention in June 2018. Mr Unsworth, a 64-year-old experienced cave explorer, splits his time between the UK and Thailand. During the rescue, he helped recruit experienced cave divers who were instrumental in freeing the boys safely. Mr Musk sent Tesla engineers and a small submarine to help with the Thai rescue effort, but it was never used. Instead, he and Mr Unsworth got into a public war of words after the diver dismissed the offer of help. Mr Unsworth labelled the submarine a ""PR stunt"", and during an interview with CNN suggested the billionaire ""stick his submarine where it hurts"". Mr Musk, who has 22 million followers, responded with a series of tweets about Mr Unsworth - including one calling him ""pedo guy"", which has since been deleted. What has been said in court so far? Testifying over two days on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr Musk told the court he did not expect the ""pedo"" tweet to be taken literally. He said that at the time he thought Mr Unsworth was ""just some random creepy guy"" who was ""unrelated to the rescue"". Mr Musk apologised on Twitter and in court for his outburst. He also said the term ""pedo guy"" was a common insult in South Africa, where he grew up. Contesting this, Mr Wood cited another now-deleted tweet the billionaire sent to his followers saying: ""Bet ya a signed dollar it's true."" Then, in an email exchange with a Buzzfeed reporter who contacted him for comment on the threat of legal action by Mr Unsworth, Mr Musk said: ""Stop defending child rapists."" On Thursday, Mr Unsworth told the court that Mr Musk's tweet left him feeling ""humiliated"". Court reporters said the diver appeared on the verge of tears as he told jurors: ""It feels very raw. I feel humiliated. Ashamed. Dirtied. Effectively, from day one, I was given a life sentence without parole. It hurts to talk about it."" He added: ""I find it disgusting. I find it very hard to even read the word, never mind talk about.""","A UK diver wants $190m (£145m) damages from Elon Musk for a tweet calling him ""pedo guy"", a US court has heard."
"Blood clinics are being held at Old Noble's Hospital in Douglas, a separate facility from the island's main hospital, during April. Health minister David Ashford said anyone attending sessions would ""not be breaking any stay-at-home rules"". ""Giving blood saves lives and it is vital to ensure that donations continue,"" he added. Donations are needed to treat patients with a range of conditions, including those involved in accidents and women who experience complications during pregnancy. ""Enhanced hygiene protocols"" have been put in place and social distancing was being adhered to at the sessions, a spokesman for the health department said. Mr Ashford said: ""We appreciate there may be some concern or reluctance during the current situation, but we can reassure people that the safety of donors and staff is always our number one priority. ""We need donors in the island who are fit and healthy to keep their appointments, keep giving blood and keep saving lives.""","Isle of Man blood donors have been told it is ""vital"" to attend appointments during the Covid-19 outbreak."
"Noor Salman, 31, was charged with obstruction of justice and aiding Omar Mateen in providing support to the Islamic State militant group. Her lawyers had argued that she was an innocent victim of her husband's lies. Mateen killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in June 2016 before he was shot dead by police. Who was the Orlando club gunman? She could have faced life in prison if found guilty. The 12-member jury returned their verdict on Friday morning on their third day of deliberations. Ms Salman sobbed as the verdict was read while her relatives hugged, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Defence lawyer Charles Swift had said in his closing argument: ""She doesn't go to the mosque, she searches for Hello Kitty on her website. ""We're supposed to believe she had long conversations with Omar Mateen about jihads?"" Her attorneys also argued she was a victim of a ""tragic marriage"" to Mateen, with no prior knowledge of the attack. Mateen, a US citizen who had been known to the FBI since 2013, entered the venue after midnight and opened fire with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, holding people hostage in the bathroom before dying in a gun battle with police. His father, Seddique Mateen, said a possible motive for the attack might have been his son's outrage at seeing two men kissing in Miami. During the trial it came to light that Seddique Mateen was a confidential FBI informant and is now under investigation for money transfers to Turkey and Afghanistan days after the attack. ""Omar Mateen is a monster,"" another defence attorney, Linda Moreno, told the jury. ""Noor Salman is a mother, not a monster. Her only sin is she married a monster."" During the attack, Ms Salman was at home with the couple's three-year-old son. After the verdict was announced, Al Salman, her uncle, addressed reporters outside the courthouse. ""Now, we're looking forward to taking my niece and hiring a therapist for her,"" Mr Salman said. ""I don't know how she's going to make up for the last two years,"" she spent in prison, he said. More than 100 advocacy organisations signed a letter supporting the release of Ms Salman from prison. ""The prosecution of Ms Salman is rooted in gendered Islamophobia and patriarchy,"" the letter read. Orlando nightclub shooting: How the attack unfolded But prosecutors pointed to a statement Ms Salman made to the FBI after her arrest in January 2017, that she knew her husband was going to do something violent. On Monday, that statement to the FBI was shown to the court. ""I wish I had done the right thing but my fear held me back. ""I wish I had been more truthful,"" she wrote. Detectives also said Ms Salman ""knowingly misled"" FBI interrogators in the hours after the attack. Special Agent Ricardo Enriquez said Ms Salman had confessed that her husband had bought a weapon and was watching Islamic State group videos. Near the end of the trial, a forensic clinical psychologist, testified that low intelligence, stress, and lack of sleep can contribute to false confessions. She had been interviewed by officials for 11 hours, and her IQ score is 84, making her ""below average in intelligence,"" said Bruce Frumkin. Orlando police released a statement after the verdict was announced. ""I believe in our criminal justice system and am grateful for the jury's hard work,"" Chief John Mina said. But he added: ""Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murder of 49 of our neighbours, friends, family members and loved ones.""",The widow of a gunman who killed dozens at a Florida nightclub two years ago has been found not guilty of helping him.
"Last week's fare rises prompted protests from his Trinamul Congress party, a key ally of the federal government. His party wants him to roll back the increase, but he refused to do so. India's state-owned railway operates 7,000 passenger trains and carries some 13 million passengers daily. Mr Trivedi raised the fares in Wednesday's railway budget by a maximum of 30 paisa ($0.006; £0.0038) per km, saying the network was passing through a ""difficult phase"". However, within hours of the announcement, Mamata Banerjee, the chief of the Trinamul Congress party, rejected the increase and sought the resignation of the minister. 'Discipline' Mr Trivedi stepped down on Sunday evening after speaking to Ms Banerjee. He said that the Trinamul Congress party had been instrumental in making him a minister and accepted that he ""must obey the party's discipline"". Ms Banerjee has already asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to replace Mr Trivedi with another party MP, Mukul Roy. Mr Trivedi had said he had been advised to impose a big fare increase as there had been none in nearly a decade, but had opted for a modest rise instead, out of ""concern for the common man"". Railways officials say the jump in fuel prices over the last eight years has badly affected their bottom line.",India's Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi has resigned after his party protested against his decision to increase passenger fares.
"By Reality Check teamBBC News Now questions are being asked as to whether a deadly price has been paid for this - in the lives of election officials, more than 500 of whom are reported to have died during the vote and in the following days. Media reports say the burden of organising and counting the votes led to exhaustion and death for some of the seven million or so workers who took part. But were the deaths above the average that would be expected in Indonesia for this group of people had there not been an election? How many officials died? The vote on 17 April was a huge logistical exercise with more than 190 million voters taking part in a country made up of 18,000 islands and covering nearly two million square kilometres. The Indonesian election commission told the BBC there were 7,385,500 personnel involved in running the poll, of whom 5,672,303 were civilian workers. The rest were security personnel guarding polling stations. All the counting was done by hand, and reports suggest it often continued through the night and into the next day to meet deadlines. By 28 April, the election commission said that more than 270 of these election workers had died from overwork-related conditions.. It also said another 1,878 had fallen ill. This death toll was subsequently revised upwards to more than 550. Was the death toll higher than expected? With more than seven million people involved in the poll, you would expect a significant number to die during the poll in line with national death rates. The question is: was this number higher as a result of the election? Well, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia has a death rate of 7.16 per 1,000 per year (2017 data). So applying that death rate to the figure of seven million election workers, you would expect around 137 people to die daily. Let's assume that each election official was involved for four days - that would include any preparation, the poll itself and the subsequent counting. Based on the national death rate above, you would expect around 548 people to die during this time. This is pretty much exactly in line with the figure given by the Indonesian election commission. Which groups were most affected? This very approximate calculation does not take into account age, gender, health conditions or other factors. The Indonesian authorities said that most of those who died were workers aged over 50. So you would perhaps expect a higher death rate among election workers than for the overall population. Continuing controversy It is clear that the conditions under which election officials were required to work remains a matter of intense debate - despite there being no clear evidence that more died than would have been expected over a similar period. In a report on election deaths, released by the Indonesian health ministry, it lists a number of health conditions which it says contributed to the deaths, including heart failure, strokes, respiratory problems, meningitis and sepsis. We do not know how many of those who died had pre-existing health issues. Of those admitted to hospital complaining of fatigue and stress, most had worked non-stop for 24 hours or longer to get their vote counts finished. Add to that the fact they may also have spent several days before the vote ensuring everything was ready. The weather was hot in April. although not excessively so. Jesse Hession Grayman of the University of Auckland says that while the number of deaths is unusual compared to the 2014 election when the death toll was 144, more work is needed before reaching a conclusion. ""It would need a detailed investigation of the demographic and health profiles of the election workers to see if the numbers fall within expected mortality rates,"" he told the BBC. The controversy over the deaths has now sparked a debate about health checks being implemented in future for election officials, and the need for proper breaks and management of the workflow. There have also been suggestions that Indonesia should look to other Asian democracies such as India and South Korea, where voting is staggered and technology is used to help record and count votes.

"""We want to design a novel class of antibiotics with very low propensity for resistance that will treat a wide variety of superbugs,"" says Anand Anandkumar, the CEO of Bugworks, which is based at the government-funded Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms. ""We hope to create a billion dollar drug company with just 18 people."" That's an ambitious goal, not least because the last novel class of antibiotics to be licensed was discovered in 1987. But Bugworks has high-profile support after becoming the first company outside the US or Europe funded by the $455m (£343m) CARB-X accelerator, which supports start-ups combating antimicrobial-resistance (AMR). India is in urgent need of new antibiotics. AMR is a global problem, but earlier this month a report from the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP) in Delhi found India had some of the highest resistance rates in bacteria responsible for common infections. CDDEP director Ramanan Laxminarayan, an unpaid adviser for Bugworks, says uncontrolled antibiotics use in humans and livestock combined with high disease transmission rates and poor sanitation has created a serious problem. ""We probably have among the worst resistance in the world,"" he says. The problem prompted India's government to release a National Action Plan on AMR in April, calling for strengthened monitoring of the spread of drug resistance, better education and training, improved infection control, better regulation of antibiotic use, and investment in research. In unpublished tests in lab dishes and animals, Bugworks' lead candidate has proved potent against several superbugs flagged by the World Health Organization as priorities and it hopes to start clinical trials within two years. Other Indian companies are working on new antibiotics too. Start-ups like Hyderabad-based Vitas Pharma and Bangalore-based GanGagen have promising candidates close to clinical trials and pharmaceutical major Wockhardt announced in April the US Food and Drug Administration had fast-tracked its new superbug-focused antibiotic for clinical trials. The biggest barriers remain financial, says Vitas Pharma CEO, Radha Rangarajan. Investors are put off by high failure rates of new antibiotic candidates as well as short courses and historically low prices that make them less lucrative than treatments for long-term diseases like diabetes or cancer. ""The ecosystem is starting to change, though, because there is an unmet need and there is recognition that highly resistant infections are now a global public health threat,"" she adds. The difficulty in securing investment makes it important for the public sector to take a leading role, says Anil Koul, director of the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH) in the north Indian city of Chandigarh, particularly with diseases affecting India disproportionately, like drug-resistant tuberculosis. ""India accounts for about 25% of the global tuberculosis burden,"" says Dr Koul. ""Unless and until we in the public sector try and address this public heath challenge via parternships, the ambitious goal of ending tuberculosis will remain a distant dream."" Solutions will only get to market with private sector support though, adds Dr Koul, a former research head at healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson, which is why his institute is forging collaborations with multinationals including a recently announced partnership on tuberculosis with his former employer. ""The aim is to have the first tuberculosis drug discovered and developed in India, but to be used by patients across the world."" India is well-positioned to contribute to the global fight back against AMR, says Dr Koul. It has huge numbers of patients who can be enrolled in clinical trials and its large pharmaceutical industry - India is the largest exporter of generic drugs - means there is abundant, skilled manpower and a supportive ecosystem. India's well-developed biotechnology sector has been vital for Bugworks, says Dr Anandkumar, making it easy to hire talent and allowing it to outsource activities like synthesising molecules and carrying out studies so its team can focus entirely on drug discovery. Developing new antibiotics is hard, though. High failure rates, the innate complexities of beating drug resistance and unattractive economics have seen most multinationals retreat from infectious diseases in recent years. Dr Anandkumar thinks the failures were partly because big, process-driven pharmaceutical companies are not suited to the agile, multidisciplinary work required for early-stage drug discovery. They got burned after investing billions on robotic technology to systematically test thousands of candidates, he says, but it turns out drug discovery is as much art as science. ""It's chaotic, it runs on nervous energy, which doesn't lend itself to processes,"" he adds. ""Advanced discovery can only happen in small biotech firms."" It's early days though, says CDDEP's Dr Laxminarayan. Until these companies complete human trials it's hard to judge their products' viability and, even then, new drugs are only one part of the puzzle for India. Without better infection control and regulation of antibiotic use ""it's like mopping the floor with the tap still running"", he says.","In a shared lab on the outskirts of the southern Indian city of Bangalore, a biotech start-up is fighting back against India's looming drug-resistance crisis, writes Edd Gent."
"The wedding scene in The Godfather is a sumptuous affair, replete with hope, but laced with menace. Now, undercover police agents in Italy have infiltrated the real thing and revealed a fascinating insight into modern day organised crime. Weddings, baptisms and other events have been targeted by officers as part of an operation that climaxed this week with the arrest of more than 300 suspected mobsters. Their syndicate is not the ""Mafia"", as such, which is the name given to the Sicilian Cosa Nostra. It's the 'Ndrangheta, a gang that's less well known outside Italy, but which experts believe is now a much more powerful organisation. Surveillance Details of the police undercover operation have just been released. For more than two years they've carried out surveillance on the 'Ndrangheta. It included agents attending one wedding last year of the children of two crime bosses from the 'Ndrangheta. Along with the thousands of well wishers at the event, was Domenico Oppedisano. Police say he was there not only for the wedding, but to be named as the new head of the 'Ndrangheta. Two weeks later, the undercover agents got video of Mr Oppedisano being formally appointed as leader and other senior crime syndicate bosses being elevated to their new positions. Mr Oppedisano was among those arrested in this week's raids. Family meetings Investigators say that since August of last year, they've been able to record all the major negotiations of the various families that make up the 'Ndrangheta. They say that includes around 40 meetings in Lombardy in northern Italy, an area which has become a major focus for the 'Ndrangheta, far from its base in Calabria, in the ""foot"" of southern Italy. It is now believed that as many as 500 members of the 'Ndrangheta operate in Lombardy alone, with Milan at its heart. One hundred and sixty alleged members of the gang were picked up in Lombardy as part of the police raids. That significant move into northern Italy is just one of developments to emerge as a result of this operation. Another is that police didn't realise how well organised the 'Ndrangheta is. They say it has a tight hierarchical structure and is not just an association of clans, as previously thought. That became clear, they say, when the Lombardy branch tried to exert some autonomy from its southern base. Police say Calabrian bosses sent a professional killer to murder the would-be upstarts. Police haven't made clear if that actually happened. The 'Ndrangheta emerged in the mid-1970s, though its origins can be traced back to the 19th Century, when it appeared to surface in the aftermath of Italian unification. It fought a series of bloody internal feuds which left hundreds dead. Submarine Now it appears much more cohesive. As well as operating across Europe, it has links with the Colombian drug cartels. In 2006, Italy's anti-Mafia prosecutor announced the discovery of a submarine in Colombia, which was apparently being constructed on behalf of the 'Ndrangheta for smuggling cocaine. Cocaine is thought to be its biggest source of revenue, along with extortion and money laundering. Italian magistrates have estimated its annual income at more than 35 billion euros. That's more than Fiat. This week's operation against it won't finish off the 'Ndrangheta. It's too wily and entrenched for that. But we've now been given a better glimpse into how it works - and into what the authorities are doing to control an organisation that really has come out from the shadow of its more famous Sicilian neighbours.","Following Tuesday's arrests of at least 300 suspected members of the 'Ndrangheta, the BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome takes a closer look at the Italian crime family."
"The letter was handed over by the envoy, Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae. The contents of the letter were not disclosed, but North Korea said earlier that it was willing to take ""positive action"" to improve strained relations. They cooled after China supported tightened UN sanctions following North Korea's third nuclear test in February. Vice Marshal Choe has said that his country was willing to make joint efforts to resolve problems through six-party talks and other forms of dialogue, the state-run China News Service said. China is North Korea's biggest trading partner and closest ally. Earlier Vice Marshal Choe met senior Chinese official Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of China's Political Bureau. He is the most senior North Korean official to visit China since August 2012 and the talks follow weeks of tension on the Korean peninsula and a series of threats from the North. Mr Liu said that all relevant parties should support the goal of denuclearisation, and also called for a return to six-party talks, Chinese media said. Vice Marshal Choe said North Korea appreciated China's efforts to maintain peace and stability, and was ""willing to accept the suggestion of the Chinese side and launch dialogue with all relevant parties"", China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Traditional allies The two neighbours generally enjoy warm relations. China has prioritised maintaining stability in North Korea to avoid any crisis that could trigger the fall of the regime and propel a flow of refugees across the border. But following North Korea's third nuclear test, China adopted a tougher stance. It supported tightened UN sanctions, and some of its banks have recently suspended trading with North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank. Relations were also strained after a Chinese fishing boat, with 16 crew members, was seized in the Yellow Sea by unidentified North Koreans. The crew were released two weeks later. Tensions in the Korean Peninsula were heightened earlier this year, as Pyongyang threatened to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor and increased its rhetoric with threats to attack Japanese, South Korean and US military targets in the region.","A North Korean envoy visiting China has met President Xi Jinping and handed him a letter written by Kim Jong-un, Chinese state media has reported."
"Protests first erupted in Chile in October and were held almost daily, but largely subsided as coronavirus spread. But anger over low wages, high costs of living and inequality which triggered the protests has not diminished. The police said that they made the arrests because ""mass congregations are prohibited"". Health officials have banned gatherings of more than 50 people, restaurants and bars are closed and an evening curfew is in place. It is not clear exactly how many people attended the protest at Plaza Italia but photos posted on social media appeared to show protesters keeping their distance from each other. During the wave of protests which swept the country last year, President Sebastián Piñera's approval ratings fell to historic lows and he faced repeated calls to resign. Earlier this month, he sparked criticism by posing for photos in an empty Plaza Italia while the city was under a strict lockdown. What sparked the protests? The protests were originally triggered by a rise in the metro fare in Santiago, but soon became a much wider movement denouncing inequality in Chile, the high costs of healthcare and poor funding of education. Excessive use of force by police, with hundreds of protesters blinded by rubber bullets, further stoked Chileans' anger. Protesters also took issue with Chile's constitution, which dates back to the years of military rule under Gen Augusto Pinochet. At the height of the protests in October, Chile pulled out of hosting two major international summits, the COP25 climate summit and the Apec trade forum, for fear of violence.","Chilean police broke up anti-government protests in Santiago and arrested 14 people on Monday night local time, citing social distancing laws."
"Many people are sheltering in schools or other buildings in Hassakeh city and the town of Tal Tamer, the UN says. Turkey took action on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled American troops out of the area. At least 11 civilians have died. Humanitarian groups say the number of people affected will rise further. Dozens of fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and pro-Turkish factions have been killed. The first death of a Turkish soldier was confirmed by Turkey's military. Analysts say the US withdrawal in effect gave Turkey the green light to begin its cross-border assault. Much of the region has been outside the control of the Syrian government as a consequence of the civil war which began in 2011. It has been controlled by the SDF since 2015. The SDF have been key allies of the US in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group but Turkey regards the Kurdish militias of the SDF as ""terrorists"" who support an anti-Turkish insurgency. Turkey defended its offensive as a bid to create a ""safe zone"" free of Kurdish militias which could also house Syrian refugees. ""We will not stop it no matter what anyone says,"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday. One major concern for the international community is the fate of thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, being guarded by Kurdish-led forces in the region. What's the latest on the fighting? On Friday, IS said it had planted a car bomb that killed six people - civilians and members of the security forces - in the border town of Qamishli on Friday. Meanwhile, US media report that an explosion occurred near a US base in Kobane, but no injuries have been reported. On Thursday, Turkish troops partly encircled the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. But while the Turkish military said its operation was going to plan, Kurdish sources and activists from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the offensive had not made much progress. Turkish warplanes have struck targets in both towns, and video footage has shown columns of smoke rising above them. Tal Abyad's only public hospital has been forced to close. The Kurdish Red Crescent said there had been 11 confirmed civilian deaths so far and 28 serious injuries, mostly in Ras al-Ain and another border town, Qamishli. Some are children. At least five people, including a Syrian baby, were reportedly killed in Kurdish shelling of Turkish border towns. The SOHR reported at least 29 deaths among the SDF and 17 from among pro-Turkish Syrian rebels (known as the Syrian National Army), as more than 10 villages fell into Turkish hands. In a later report they said that seven members of pro-Turkish forces including a Turkish soldier had been killed as the SDF retook a village in Tal Abyad region. Turkey's military confirmed a soldier's death, and said three others had been wounded. Turkey's Anadolu news agency said late on Thursday 228 Kurdish militants had been ""neutralised"" since the start of the operation. The casualty reports could not be independently verified. What about displaced people? A refugee crisis is developing. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) gave the figure of 100,000 but aid groups say as many as 450,000 people could be forced to move. According to aid workers on the ground, the vast majority of civilians have fled Tal Abyad and those who remain fear for their lives. OCHA said the Turkish bombardment had affected key civilian infrastructure such as water stations. Thousands of people could lose adequate access to clean water in the Hassakeh region, it reports. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" running for 480km (300 miles) along the Syrian side of the border but says it will not advance deeper than a planned 32km limit. What has the reaction been? On Friday Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had shared ""serious concerns"" about the operation in a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. He expected Turkey, a Nato member, to ""act with restraint"", he added. Mr Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation. Also on Friday, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said the Turkish operation ""risks the security of ISIS prison camps"" and could further destabilise the region. He added that the US was ""not abandoning"" its Kurdish partners there. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that President Donald Trump had authorised new sanctions on Turkey, but added that the US had not yet chosen to activate them. How is the incursion affecting the IS situation? The SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". On Friday the Kurdish-led authorities said discussions were under way on how to move the Ain Issa camp, which had been hit by shelling. Turkey has said it will take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive. Are you in the affected area? If it is safe to do so contact us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

"By Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter It was a tall order for a 12-minute speech, which reflects the complicated, fraught-with-peril position in which the president currently finds himself. He was elected to help disentangle the nation from a Middle East war, and now a majority of the American public seems to support a new military incursion into that same region. He ran for office as the face of a more diverse, inclusive country, and yet some of the Republicans who hope to replace him have called for a religious test for Syrian refugees, racial profiling of Muslim Americans and closing down ""any place where radicals are being inspired"", in the words of Florida Senator Marco Rubio. 'New phase' of terrorism Mr Obama has claimed that the US is winning the war against al-Qaeda and compared its spin-off groups to a ""JV team"" - a term for the squad of lesser athletes in a high school sport programme. But a series of ideologically inspired attacks on US soil, along with the bloodshed in Paris last month, has Americans increasingly concerned. For the first time Mr Obama acknowledged that the nation faces a pattern of violence inspired by ""a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West"". He drew a line connecting the shootings at Fort Hood, a Texas military base, the Boston Marathon bombings, an attack on an Army recruiting station in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the recent bloodshed in San Bernardino and said it represents a ""new phase"" of terrorist threat to the US. ""As we've become better at preventing complex multifaceted attacks like 9/11,"" he said, ""terrorists turn to less complicated acts of violence like the mass shootings that are all too common in our society."" Lax gun laws That reference to the recent strings of US mass shootings - at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado and a church in South Carolina, for instance - was not simply made in passing, as would be clear later in the president's speech. After outlining the steps his administration was already taking to defeat the so-called Islamic State (IS), he spoke of what he sees as a real threat to US security - the nation's lax gun laws. He said individuals on the federal ""no-fly"" list, which prevents suspected militants from boarding US aircraft, should be prohibited from purchasing guns. ""What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semiautomatic weapon?"" he asked. ""This is a matter of national security."" More than that, however, Mr Obama called for Congress to pass legislation making it harder for every American to obtain ""powerful assault weapons, like the ones that were used in San Bernardino"". The president has often urged greater regulation of firearms, but now he is explicitly making the case in terms of safeguarding the nation against threats both at home and inspired abroad. ""The fact is that our intelligence and law-enforcement agencies, no matter how effective they are, cannot identify every would-be mass shooter,"" he said, ""whether that individual was motivated by ISIL or some other hateful ideology"". Mr Obama's call comes the day after the New York Times issued a rare front-page editorial in which it proposed a ban on ""military-style"" semi-automatic rifles, prompting outcry from gun-rights groups. One conservative commentator, Erick Erickson, tweeted a picture of the newspaper, riddled with bullet holes. The president's proposal will likely receive a similarly hostile reception. ""Millions of Americans have chosen to protect themselves and their families by purchasing a firearm,"" Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said in a statement released shortly before the president's speech. ""This is their right; indeed protecting their families is their obligation."" 'Coming together' Mr Obama also asked Congress to provide him with a direct authorisation for the use of force to fight IS and for more thorough screening of visitors who currently enter the US without a visa to see if they've been to war zones, but those requests will likely be overshadowed by the gun-control issue - and questions about Mr Obama's overall IS strategy. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that the president's speech comes in the middle of a heated battle among Republicans for their party's presidential nomination. For the better part of a year, many candidates on the right have been warning that IS presents a pressing national security threat that is being underestimated by the current administration. After the Paris attacks and, in particular, after the San Beranardino shootings, some of the Republicans who hope to replace Mr Obama in the White House are claiming vindication. ""We need to come to grips with the idea that we are in the midst of the next world war,"" New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another presidential aspirant, said on Friday. Mr Obama acknowledged the reality of the US electoral calendar toward the end of his Sunday night speech, after urging Americans not to ""turn against one another"" or frame the conflict as a war between the US and Islam. ""Even in this political season, even as we properly debate what steps I and future presidents must take to keep our country safe, let's make sure we never forget what makes us exceptional,"" he said. ""Let's not forget that freedom is more powerful than fear. That we have always met challenges, whether war or depression, natural disasters or terrorist attacks, by coming together around our common ideals as one nation and one people."" Donald Trump offered his brusque reply to the speech shortly after its conclusion. ""Is that all there is?"" tweeted the current Republican front-runner. ""We need a new president - FAST!"" Until the US presidential race concludes in just under 11 months, national unity is going to be hard to find.","On Sunday night, in his television address on the San Bernardino shootings and the ""broader threat of terrorism"", President Barack Obama sought to tell Americans what he was doing, what Congress should do and what the nation shouldn't do."
"The Vietnam War hero, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians, died a week ago from brain cancer at the age of 81. His daughter Meghan was the first to speak, paying an emotional tribute to her father while also criticising President Donald Trump's agenda. Mr Trump did not attend the service. The two Republicans had major differences, both personal and political, and Mr McCain's family made it clear that Mr Trump was not welcome. Members of the Trump administration who were present included the president's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Following memorial services in the state of Arizona - which Mr McCain represented as a senator, and where he died last Saturday - and in Washington, a private burial service will be held at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday. On Friday Mr McCain's body was taken back to the Congress buildings where he worked for decades and lay in state in the Capitol rotunda overnight. On the way from the Capitol to the cathedral on Saturday morning, the cortege stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where his widow Cindy laid a wreath. 'The real thing' Meghan McCain told mourners at the cathedral: ""We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. ""The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served. ""The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold, she is resourceful and confident and secure, she meets her responsibilities, she speaks quietly because she is strong. ""America does not boast, because she does not need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great."" Former President Obama paid tribute to the man he defeated in the 2008 US presidential election. He described Mr McCain as an ""extraordinary man - a warrior, a statesman, a patriot"" who embodied much of what made America great. Mr Obama said that, despite their many differences, ""we never doubted we were on the same team"". He added: ""John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values - like rule of law and human rights - and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being."" Mr Bush - who defeated Mr McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 - paid tribute to the senator's courage, honesty and sense of honour. ""At various points during his long career, John confronted polices and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: 'We are better than this, America is better than this.' ""John would be the first to tell you he was not a perfect man, but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have as yet conceived."" Other speakers included former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 95. Maverick Before he went into politics, Mr McCain was a US Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi while on a bombing mission in 1967. He was held as a prisoner until 1973, enduring torture that - along with the injuries he sustained bailing out of his jet - left him with life-long injuries. While deeply conservative on some issues, the Arizona senator had a maverick streak that endeared him to political friends and opponents. He championed reform of US immigration, campaign finance and environmental laws, and was outspoken in criticising those who advocated what he considered torture against captured enemies of the US. The pallbearers he chose reflected his desire to reach across political divides. They included Hollywood actor and liberal political activist Warren Beatty; former independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; liberal former Senator Russ Feingold, who drew up campaign finance reform legislation with McCain; and Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara Murza.",Ex-presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have paid tribute to Senator John McCain at a memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral.
"Hundreds of people have reportedly been left homeless by the evacuation of local pastoral communities. One young Maasai is said to have been shot and critically injured. It is part of a longstanding border dispute between local Maasai people and authorities who operate exclusive hunting experiences for tourists. The Tanzanian government had plans to establish a 1,500sq km (579sq mile) wildlife corridor around the national park for a Dubai-based company which offers hunting packages for wealthy tourists from the UAE. The plan would have displaced about 30,000 people, and caused ecological problems for the Maasai community, which depends on the seasonal grasses there to rear livestock. But the country's president tweeted in 2014 that an eviction would not take place, after more than two million people signed a petition against the action. However reported incidents of destruction of Maasai sites persisted. The chairman of Ololosokwani village, Kerry Dukunyi, has told the BBC that villagers have lost property in the latest incident. ""A large percentage of our food has been destroyed. We've lost a lot of food,"" he said. ""A lot of our livestock are also missing."" It's the latest example in East Africa of the growing tensions between wildlife conservation, which attracts tourists, and the need for locals to have pastoral land, especially during droughts. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa formed a commission to investigate the dispute but its report is yet to be made public.",More than 100 Maasai huts in Tanzania have been allegedly burned down by game reserve authorities near the Serengeti National Park.
"The decision on Liberation and Rapide services between the Channel Islands, the UK and France, should help to boost the economy, the company said. The passenger sailings are planned to restart on 21 May. Passengers on Commodore Clipper and the Commodore Goodwill must continue to provide a negative test within 72 hours of departure. Elwyn Dop, operations director, said: ""We stepped up safety protocols earlier this year to protect those on our conventional ships and keep freight shipments secure."" ""The encouraging news of a reduction in cases and a ramping up of vaccinations in the UK has provided us with the confidence that these tests will not be needed for travel on our passenger ferries when we restart, although we will retain this requirement on Clipper and Goodwill,"" he said. He added that the company's decision ""has no bearing on the need for testing by public health authorities on arrivals in Guernsey and Jersey"" and advised passengers to check the requirements for all countries to which they are travelling to.

"Speaking on Russian state TV, he said Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko ""asked me to set up a certain police reserve"" and ""I have done so"". ""We also agreed that it won't be used until the situation gets out of control,"" he told Rossiya 1TV. Mr Lukashenko's disputed 9 August re-election triggered huge protests. Separately, at least 13 journalists - including a BBC team - were detained in the centre of the capital, Minsk, ahead of a planned opposition protest. The interior ministry said they had been taken to a police station for identity checks, but the BBC's Steve Rosenberg said it was a ""clear attempt to interfere with coverage of events"". 'Levelling out' Mr Putin said Russia had an obligation to help Belarus with its security under the two countries' close alliance, and he stressed the deep cultural, ethnic and linguistic ties between the two nations. He said the new reserve force would not go into Belarus unless ""extremist elements using political slogans as cover cross a certain boundary and start armed robbery, setting fire to cars, houses, banks, try to seize government buildings and so forth"". He added that ""on the whole, though, the situation now is levelling out"". Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Mr Putin was using the idea of restoring control in Belarus to hide a hostile breach of international law. He said the plan must immediately be withdrawn. Russia and Belarus are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, made up of a number of post-Soviet countries. The two nations formed a union in 1996 that promoted greater integration as well as guaranteeing citizens the right to work and reside freely in both countries. What's behind Putin's plan? President Putin is upping the ante on Belarus, with a direct confirmation of what Alexander Lukashenko claimed some time ago: that Russia will step in to help him, with force, if things go bad. Just what force, and how bad, Mr Putin hasn't fully defined. By ""law enforcement officers"", he doesn't mean ordinary street police, though. The term is far broader, including riot police, the National Guard (Rosgvardia) and even the FSB. So the potential for some kind of Russian intervention now hangs as an open threat both to opposition leaders and protesters - and to the West. Because Vladimir Putin also underlined the special relationship between Minsk and Moscow - ethnic bonds, family ties, and economic links. Russia cared what happened across its border, he said, more than once. He did nod to the concerns of protesters: if there were no problems, they wouldn't be out on the streets, Mr Putin reasoned. But on the whole, this was a statement of support for President Lukashenko. Russia has got his back. The EU and US have rejected the 9 August Belarus vote as neither free nor fair. The EU is preparing sanctions against officials it accuses of rigging the result to deliver Mr Lukashenko's victory and of cracking down on the opposition movement. The scale of the demonstrations in the Belarusian capital Minsk is unprecedented. Mr Lukashenko claimed a sixth term, after 26 years as president already, with 80% of the vote. A criminal case has targeted the opposition Co-ordination Council, which Mr Lukashenko accuses of trying to seize power. The most prominent opposition leader inside Belarus, Maria Kolesnikova, has been questioned by prosecutors. Arriving at the investigative committee building in Minsk, she was applauded as she urged supporters not to give up. Prosecutors questioned the Nobel literature prize-winner Svetlana Alexievich on Wednesday. She told reporters she had refused to answer their questions, and said the council's activities were totally legal. The council was launched by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the leading opposition candidate for president, who is now in exile in neighbouring Lithuania.","Russian President Vladimir Putin says he has formed a police reserve force to intervene in Belarus if necessary, but that point has not yet been reached."
"A motion to repeal parts of Guernsey's Zero-10 tax regime will be put to States members in June. Deputy Gavin St Pier said: ""If the States pass this measure, we will repeal the regime from 1 January 2013."" The Zero-10 system was introduced in 2008, but was deemed harmful by an EU review in April 2012. The system allows some corporations in Guernsey to pay no tax, while others - such as banks - pay 10% tax. Deputy St Pier said the EU Code of Conduct Group had given its formal assessment of Zero-10 to the States earlier in the week. He said the main change made to the system would be to the ""deemed distribution"" of business profits. Deputy St Pier said this element treated profits as belonging to businesses' shareholders, despite not actually being distributed. He acknowledged that there may be a financial cost to the island of changing the Zero-10 system, and said: ""Our best estimates at the moment are around £3-4m per year."" Jersey and the Isle of Man have similar corporate tax systems, and were also required to make changes to bring them in line with EU guidelines.","The European Union would leave Guernsey alone if the island changed its corporate tax regime, said the States' Treasury and Resources minister."
"By Ahmed MaherBBC Arabic ""When I was 15, we were playing PlayStation in a games arcade, and someone insulted me. I picked up a billiards cue and smashed it over his head. I was screaming abuse at everyone. I even broke the windows."" Abdul Hameed, now 24, remembers the moment he realised his drug habit had spiralled out of control. Two years earlier, aged just 13, he had tried the opioid-based painkiller Tramadol for the first time. Like many young Egyptians, he started by taking one quarter of a 100mg tablet to get high. ""I felt like I was a superhero,"" he says. ""I could do anything."" By the time he went berserk in the games arcade Abdul Hameed was taking 57 painkillers a day - a mixture of Tramadol and other commonly available opioid-based tablets. He has over-dosed and almost died several times since. 'The sad truth' According to the Egyptian Fund for Drug Control and Addiction Treatment, more than 10% of the total population of nearly 100 million had used narcotics, and almost one-in-three addicts are hooked on painkillers. Tramadol is their drug of choice. It first appeared on the market in Egypt 20 years ago. Cheaper than heroin and easily available, it quickly became popular with addicts and then spread to the wider population as a way to deal not just with physical pain but also the stresses of everyday life. Tramadol has taken such a hold in Egypt that addiction helplines say they are getting as many as 500 calls a day from people desperate to break the habit. Addicts are likely to be young. The government-run drug rehab centre at Cairo's Abbasiya Psychiatric Hospital told the BBC more than half its patients are aged between 21 and 30. According to official statistics most Tramadol addicts in Egypt are men - around 70% - but there are also a growing number of women. Young mum Ahlam started taking Tramadol to cope with the drudgery of housework and childcare. Like Abdul Hameed she began with a quarter of a 100mg tablet, but quickly progressed to four tablets a day and now, even if she ups the dose the drug no longer has the same effect. ""I used to enjoy the energy surge,"" she says. ""But now the high isn't there anymore."" The toll addiction is taking on Ahlam is plain to see. She is pale and thin, chain-smokes cigarettes, and looks much older than her 28 years. Her family are also suffering. ""My husband gave me money to buy chicken,"" she says. ""I pretended I'd bought some and the children had eaten it all. But of course it wasn't true. I used the money to buy Tramadol and I fed them cheap pasta instead. This is the sad truth."" Ahlam has sold things from the family home to make money to feed her drug habit, and at one particularly bleak moment she even offered sex to a neighbour, also an addict, in return for some pills. He refused. Over the counter One of the reasons Tramadol has become so popular in Egypt is that it is so easy to get hold of. By law it can only be sold on prescription, and pharmacists caught selling it without a prescription face up to 25 years in jail. But addicts say the restrictions are widely ignored. This was the case when I walked into a pharmacy in central Cairo and asked for Tramadol. I was told they had run out, and was offered two alternative and equally addictive painkillers instead. At no point was I asked for a prescription. Dr Yasin Rajal, the technical director of the Egypt's Central Administration for Pharmaceutical Affairs, told the BBC that the Health Ministry recognised the dangers of painkillers and was making efforts to to crack down on illegal sales. ""Various pieces of legislation are in place to regulate the sale of painkillers,"" he said. ""The Health Ministry keeps an eye on pharmaceutical outlets in Egypt and works alongside the Ministry of the Interior to carry out inspections and spot-checks."" 'Street market' But even if the authorities could stop pharmacies selling Tramadol without prescription, users have found other ways to get hold of it. So-called ""doctor shopping"" is now common practice. Addicts consult several doctors at the same time, feigning a back problem or a sports injury, and get several different painkiller prescriptions which they use in different pharmacies. There is also a thriving black market. In Egypt's third biggest city, Giza, south-west of Cairo, I visit a back street where addicts to come to buy their drugs. The sun has just gone down and there are so many people milling around that it feels like an evening street market. Dealers try to keep order, shouting at the crowds to stand in line - Tramadol to the right, hashish and heroin to the left. Many addicts are buying a drink they call ""cockroaches"" which is based on a drug used to treat Parkinson's Disease. It is all shockingly open and matter of fact. Turning a corner Abdul Hameed hopes that this is world he has finally left behind. He is now three months into his latest attempt to kick his drug habit. Several previous attempts have failed, on his own at home and in unlicensed ""treatment warehouses"" where addicts are locked in a room and left alone to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. Now he is in a private clinic. ""They give us different medication to treat the withdrawal symptoms, and gradually reduce the dosage of addictive substances,"" he says. ""We attend meditation classes, play sport, share experiences. I feel like I'm born again."" For the first time in years he is starting to look to the future with hope. ""I've started private tuition to prepare to go back to school,"" he says. He dreams about getting married one day and having children. He's also hoping to train as a drug treatment specialist. More than anything else, he says, he wants to try to use his own battles with addiction to help others. Top picture illustration by Ismail Moneer Correction 4 June 2018: This story has been amended to make clear that almost one-in-three drug addicts in Egypt are hooked on painkillers, rather than one-in-three Egyptians as stated in an earlier version.","In December 2017 British woman Laura Plummer was jailed for three years for bringing 300 Tramadol painkiller tablets into Egypt. While the sentence shocked many in the UK, the case shone a light on a painkiller addiction problem blighting millions of Egyptians."
"By Lauren TurnerBBC News, El Paso ""I've never been scared of being Hispanic ever before, but now I am,"" says Ivonne Diaz, 31, bursting into tears. ""I can't believe this has happened. El Paso is a city of immigrants and we have always fought for each other."" At 10:30 on a Saturday in August, there is no more ordinary activity than heading to the supermarket. Thousands of people were at the Walmart in El Paso that day. The car park at the border town was full of cars bearing US and Mexican number plates, their drivers and passengers picking up back-to-school supplies or just some bread and milk. Maybe a few beers for the weekend. And then gunshots rang out, killing 20 people. Two more have since died from their injuries. The shockwaves have been reverberating all weekend. ""I'm just worried for the list of names to come out,"" says taxi driver Carla Karam. ""Everyone will have known someone. We all know each other - it's a city of six degrees of separation."" What strikes you here is the friendliness. Strangers are welcomed with open arms - literally in some cases, with hugs being given to journalists along with bottles of water. Cynthia Chavez, 41, says: ""I'm so sad and don't know how we're meant to explain this to our kids. In El Paso, we're the type of people who, if you come to town, we will welcome you with open doors and make you feel part of this town."" Danielle Novoa, 30, who was with her husband, her twin sister and 10-month-old son, says they were heading to the store and were half an hour away when they heard what had happened. ""We knew right away it wouldn't be someone local. There's no way any citizen could live or think that way. ""Being Latina, in a huge Hispanic community, there were times I would think: 'Hey, we could be a target because of how things are now in other states.' But then I never really thought it would happen to us. ""We feel so safe walking out the door in El Paso. But now, we'll be thinking: 'Am I OK to go out and get a gallon of milk? Some diapers for the baby?'"" Julio Novoa, her husband, says: ""We've always been proud of the fact we accept the diversity of being Mexican-Americans and US citizens. And we all get on so well. ""We were targeted because we're the best of what unity and diversity means. They know we are representative of how America really can be. And because of that, it doesn't surprise me that a white supremacist would want to target us."" Others visit the makeshift memorial behind the Walmart store with their own tributes. There are flowers, teddy bears, and signs proclaiming ""El Paso Strong"". There are tears, too, for those who died and for the shattered innocence of the community. Deena Delgado, 26, who is there with her 10-month-old daughter Aerie, is weeping as she tells how her brother and niece were in Walmart at the time of the shooting. They were contemplating looking for one more item to buy when shots were fired. She fears her niece, seven, will be left traumatised. Everyone speaks of the need for the city to come together. They say they will unite and come back stronger than before. And one of the major talking points is the issue of gun control. Jose Rijos, who has lived in the city for more than 30 years, says: ""As long as we have hatred and we have a way to release that anger through guns, we're not going to have the answer. But we have the combination right now to cause this - we have the hatred and we have guns. And this is the result."" But Willa Melendez says: ""I know there's going to be a lot of people doing applications for carrying guns after this. I think that's the reality. It shouldn't be that way, but it's got to that."" She says her sister had just left Walmart when the shooting happened. ""We were on the freeway when I found out. I called everybody to check up on them, everybody,"" she says. ""My 26-year-old grandson got stuck at the mall, where he was working. He's not doing so well. He didn't sleep last night. We're so near the border here - we don't consider it two different countries. ""So this hurts. It hurts."" Jonas Porras, 19, speaks of the suspected gunman, who is just a few years older than him. ""The thought of coming here, of all places, coming here and disturbing the peace… Why not leave alone what's not to be broken? But I think this makes us stronger. It makes us who we are. We're going to pull through."" He had been on his way to Walmart when the cars in front of him started turning around, so he followed suit. ""I feel very blessed at the moment,"" he adds. As night fell, vigils were held in the city. Thousands turned out at the events to remember those who died and to join together as one community. In Ponder Park, a short distance from Walmart, hundreds upon hundreds filled the Little League field. There was a multi-faith procession before people's voices joined together in song, holding phone torches aloft. One of the biggest cheers was for three Walmart employees hailed as the heroes of the community for saving countless lives. They wept on stage as their bravery was applauded. And Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O'Rourke was among the speakers at a rally at the city's Las Americas headquarters, following a silent walk of remembrance. He was cheered as he called for an end to gun violence, alongside the parents of Joaquin Oliver, who died in the Parkland shooting in 2018. Today would have been Joaquin's birthday. As Happy Birthday was sung, people were in tears, the joint tragedies bringing them together. Butterflies were released, flying between and fluttering around people's heads. It was a reminder of the grim list of names this city joins. People held their banners again as they left the rally. One of them read: ""Shaken, not broken."" El Paso is not the kind of place where this happens. That's what its residents repeat, over and over again. The queues to give blood to the injured, with people happily waiting for hours? That's El Paso. Coming out in their thousands at a candlelit vigil to sing Amazing Grace? That's El Paso. A community coming together in one of its darkest moments to vow this can never happen again? That's El Paso.",The US border city of El Paso is in shock after a gunman apparently drove hundreds of miles to commit an atrocity there.
"Mr Jammeh, thought to now be in Equatorial Guinea, is not the first leader accused of lining his own pockets with state funds. In fact, many have taken far more. Here are some of the worst offenders. Sani Abacha, Nigeria Sani Abacha, the Nigerian leader from 1993 to 1998, reportedly looted somewhere between $1bn and $5bn from the country's coffers using fake funding requests. In 2014 the US Justice Department said it had frozen more than $450m of Abacha's stolen assets. Suharto, Indonesia Suharto, the president of Indonesia from 1967 to 1998, is alleged to have cleaned out the country's state funds to the tune of about $35bn. In 2000 he was placed under house arrest and charged with the theft of $570m via fake charities, but court doctors found him too ill to stand trial. He died in 2008. Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire The leader of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) from 1965 to 1997, Mobutu ran a murderous regime which brutally suppressed the opposition. He also lived in great style at the expense of the country's people, accumulating international properties including a 30-room mansion in Lausanne worth $5.5m. He is suspected of stealing about $5bn. Ferdinand Marcos, Philippines It's the shoes that everyone remembers - the supposed 3,000 pairs of designer shoes accumulated by Marcos' wife Imelda. They became an enduring symbol of the corruption of his leadership of the Philippines between 1965 and 1986. But Marcos is suspected of stealing more than $10bn from the country during his reign. After his death a series of lawsuits forced the Swiss banks in which he stashed the cash to release nearly $700m back to the Philippine authorities. Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh is suspected of corruptly amassing as much as $60bn during his time in office - roughly equivalent to Yemen's annual GDP - much of it through schemes to provide oil and gas contracts. He was ousted from power in 2012 after the Arab Spring, but is now allied with the Houthi rebels, locked in battle with the country's internationally recognised government. Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia Slobodan Milosevic, the brutal dictator who ran Serbia between 1989 to 1997, was eventually charged with genocide, but he was first arrested on charges of plundering funds from the Serbian state. The total is not known, but he is suspected of stealing $1-$4bn. He died in 2006, while on trial in The Hague. Hosni Mubarak, Egypt Toppled by the 2011 uprising, Hosni Mubarak went on trial accused of embezzling funds meant for the renovation of presidential palaces to do up his personal properties. Mubarak and his sons were found guilty of embezzling more than $17m over an eight-year period. He was sentenced to three years in prison while his sons, Gamal and Alaa, got four years each. Ben Ali, Tunisia The 2011 overthrow of Ben Ali marked the beginning of the Arab Spring. Ali and his wife fled to Saudi Arabia but a Tunisian court sentenced them in their absence to 35 years in prison for embezzlement and misuse of public funds. At his trial, the prosecution said $27m in jewels and public money had been found at one of his mansions.","More than $11m (£8.8m; €10.3m) is reportedly missing from The Gambia's state coffers following the departure of long-time leader Yahya Jammeh, who clung to power for nearly two months despite losing the presidential election in December."
"Mosul fell to IS in June 2014, with IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaiming the creation of a ""caliphate"" from its ancient and now destroyed Great Mosque of al-Nuri. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers, Kurdish fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, took part in the offensive, which began in October 2016. Final battle Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally declared victory over IS in the city on 10 July. He waved a national flag with troops after announcing the ""collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood"". Only hours earlier, clashes were still being reported in a small part of Old City, where a few dozen IS militants were still holding out. IS forces were pushed back into the Old City, which is a densely built-up area interconnected by small alleyways, after being encircled by pro-Iraqi government forces in the western half of Mosul. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the city, much of which has sustained heavy damage during the eight-month offensive. How the offensive unfolded The operation was launched on 17 October 2016 with the aim of retaking Mosul and the swathe of territory in northern Iraq captured by IS militants in 2014. Progress was initially swift, with pro-government forces advancing from the north, south and east, seizing outlying towns and villages despite strong resistance. Iraqi special forces first entered Mosul on 1 November 2016. But progress slowed as troops encountered fierce resistance from IS, including snipers, suicide bombers and shellfire. By January 2017 eastern Mosul was back under Iraqi government control, who announced its full ""liberation"". But the west of the city presented a more difficult challenge. The densely-packed housing and narrow alleyways enabled a relatively small number of militants to target advancing troops with snipers and suicide bombs. How territory was regained Analysis by IHS Conflict Monitor shows how IS fighters lost their territory in the face of the government offensive. Situation on 3 July Contradictory reports made it difficult to track the progress of the government offensive on the ground. The maps shown here are based on expert analysis from two different sources, the Institute for the Study of War and IHS Conflict Monitor. What damage has been caused? Satellite images show extensive damage to Mosul's infrastructure, buildings and archaeological sites - in particular to the airport and bridges. Imagery released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor in October 2016, showed how IS fighters sabotaged much of the city's airport, with wide trenches carved into it and rubble placed along their lengths. The barriers were made out of concrete blocks and other rubble, Stratfor's analysis said, possibly from the walls of destroyed buildings. Imagery also revealed how the jihadists constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the city, including north of the airport. Meanwhile, coalition air strikes destroyed all bridges linking the east and west of the city across the Tigris river, with the aim of limiting the jihadists' ability to resupply or reinforce their positions in the east. In the centre of the city, four of the five main bridges were put out of action in October and November by coalition air strikes, with the aim of limiting the jihadists' ability to resupply or reinforce their positions in the east. The Old Bridge - the only remaining route open to vehicles in the centre of the city - was then disabled in a US-led coalition air strike at the end of December 2016. Stratfor images showed how the bridges were damaged. Al-Hurriya Bridge A US air strike damaged the al-Hurriya Bridge at the eastern end in October 2016, but IS then set up a barrier on the western side, shown below. Fourth Bridge In November 2016, a US air strike damaged the Fourth Bridge, but was later rendered impassable by further damage, shown below. Iraqi military engineers installed a floating bridge across the Tigris river in May, after recapturing eastern Mosul, reconnecting the two halves of the city to facilitate troop deployments ahead of the final assault to dislodge IS. However, the UN estimates rebuilding the city's basic infrastructure will cost more than $1bn. Reinstating water, sewage and electricity services, as well as reopening schools and hospitals, would cost more than twice initial estimates, the organisation said. Ancient mosque destroyed In June 2017, the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance after declaring a ""caliphate"", was blown up by IS, according to Iraqi forces. IS claims the mosque was destroyed in a US air raid. How have people been affected? More than 800,000 people have currently fled their homes as a result of fighting in Mosul, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Most have taken refuge in nearby camps and reception centres. Others have gone to stay with relatives and friends. Following the recapture of eastern Mosul in January, there was deep concern for thousands of people remaining in the west of the city, with food supplies reported to be very low and clean drinking water in short supply. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. At least 2,463 have been killed and 1,661 injured across Nineveh province since October. UN human rights officials said in June that they had received credible reports of hundreds of civilians being shot dead by IS militants as they attempted to flee the fighting in western Mosul, with reports of others being used as ""human shields"". Dozens more have reportedly died in Iraqi and US-led coalition air strikes. The UN says many of those who have fled Mosul have witnessed the deaths of relatives, friends and neighbours and are suffering from psychological trauma..",The battle for Mosul was a huge military operation to recapture Iraq's second largest city from so-called Islamic State (IS).
"Types five and six plastics will be added to the existing types one and two in early January. Tina Norman-Ross, recycling officer, said: ""Items such as yoghurt pots, sauce bottles and food trays will be recyclable once the bins are in place. ""This will mean that there will be very few plastics that cannot be recycled."" She said additional recycling bins would be made available at many of the bring bank sites to cope with the increased volumes. All the plastics will be baled and shipped to the UK for processing. Mrs Norman-Ross said: ""To aid efficient compaction of plastics for baling, we ask that tops be removed from drinking bottles before being put in the bring banks - they can be included, just separately. ""Whilst from January we will be able to accept a much wider range of material, it is still vital that people take the time to clean their plastics before dropping them off and check they have the correct recycling symbol on it - a triangle with the number one, two, five or six inside it. ""Plastics that still have food on them can contaminate whole batches of material, meaning they have to be sent to landfill.""","More types of plastic will be recyclable in Guernsey in 2011, the Public Services Department has announced."
"The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme would mirror the procedure in operation in the UK since 2010. It would mean the likes of pubs, cafes, grocery stores and takeaways would all be required to display their rating for the public to see. A government spokesman said the system would create ""transparency"". A consultation on the proposals will run until 26 November. Hygiene standards reached by each establishment are not currently publically displayed. The rating system would range from zero, where urgent improvement is needed, to five, where hygiene standards are classed as very good. The scheme would apply to all premises where food is sold or served, including schools, care homes and hospitals. The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture said the new scheme would allow people to make ""informed choices"" about where they eat out or shop for food. The system would also act as ""an important commercial driver for businesses to achieve and maintain compliance with existing food hygiene law"", he continued. Aligning Manx food safety standards with those in the UK was ""essential"" to maintain ""continued growth of the island's food industry"", he added Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

"President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said the suspension included operations to stop people-smuggling, joint military exercises and intelligence exchange. The move came after Jakarta recalled its ambassador from Canberra on Monday. Reports of the spying allegations came out in Australian media from documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The leaked document showed that Australian spy agencies named Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the first lady, the vice-president and other senior ministers as targets for telephone monitoring, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Guardian said. The alleged spying took place in 2009, under the previous government. Australia and Indonesia are key allies and trading partners. ""It is not possible that we can continue our co-operation when we are still uncertain that there is no spying towards us,"" Mr Yudhoyono said. He added he would also write to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to seek an official explanation over spying allegations. The decision came after Mr Yudhoyono met with top officials, including the recalled Indonesian ambassador to Australia, to discuss the country's relationship with one of its closest neighbours, reports say. ""We're not only reviewing our co-operation with Australia, we're actually already implementing the downgrading of our bilateral relations with Australia,"" Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa also said on Wednesday. He added that Australia ""must take concrete steps"" to ""repair the almost irreparable damage "". He added that the relationship between both countries was ""not business as usual"". Strained relations Mr Yudhoyono said on Tuesday that ties with Australia had been ""damaged"" over what he said was ""hurtful action"". Mr Abbot reiterated on Wednesday he regretted the embarrassment the media reports have caused. However, he has also previously said he does not believe Australia ""should be expected to apologise for reasonable intelligence-gathering operations"". The document based on a presentation from the Defence Signals Directorate - now known as the Australian Signals Directorate - showed that agencies attempted to listen to Mr Yudhoyono's calls at least once. They also tracked calls made to and from his mobile phone in August 2009. The row is the latest in a series of spying allegations that have strained relations between the two allies, whose relationship include co-operation on asylum-seekers and anti-terrorism, among issues. Earlier this month, Indonesia also expressed anger over reports that Australia's Jakarta embassy was used as part of a US-led spying network in Asia.",Indonesia has suspended co-ordinated military co-operation with Australia amid an ongoing row over reports Canberra spied on Jakarta officials.
"The move would allow women to postpone pregnancy and so extend the period in which they can have children. The city of Urayasu has allocated 90 million yen ($850,000; £630,000) to the three-year pilot project. Recent census data has revealed that Japan's population had fallen by one million people in the past five years. The project is being conducted by Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital and scientists in charge say they hope preserving eggs will encourage women to give birth when they feel ready to do so. The programme will be available to women between the ages of 25 and 34. Twelve women have already started the process. Without subsidies, women have to pay the full cost of about 500,000-600,000 yen for freezing their eggs. Under the Urayasu pilot programme, they will pay 20% of the cost. At the news conference announcing the project, Urayasu mayor Hideaki Matsuzaki said low birth rates were a national problem. ""In general, pregnancy and childbirth is an individual issue. But when the situation has become this far, I consider it a social problem,"" Mr Matsuzaki said. ""I view using public expenditure as the right thing to do."" While preserving frozen eggs does prolong the period in which women can have children, the success rate using this method is not high. Studies suggest if a woman freezes her eggs at the age of 25, there's a 30% chance of successfully giving birth later. At the age of 34, the chance drops to 20%.","A city in Japan has said it will help women cover the cost of freezing their eggs, as part of efforts to address the country's declining birth rate."
"Archaeologists discovered the trove last year near the Step Pyramid of Saqqara, south of the capital. They uncovered hundreds of artefacts, including masks, statues and mummified cats, crocodiles, cobras and birds. Egyptian authorities unveiled the artefacts at an exhibition near the Saqqara necropolis on Saturday. Tests are being carried out to verify whether two of the mummified animals are lion cubs, Egypt's ministry of antiques said. Unlike mummified cats, which are frequently found by archaeologists, the discovery of intact lions is considered rare. At a news conference on Saturday, one Egyptian official touted a large scarab statue as one of the most significant discoveries. ""The most lovely discovery out of those hundreds: that scarab,"" said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. ""It is the biggest and [largest] scarab all over the world."" Saqqara is an ancient burial ground that served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia. Located around 30km (18 miles) south of Cairo, Saqqara was an active burial ground for more than 3,000 years and has been designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. In recent years, Egypt has ramped up its promotion of its archaeological finds in a bid to revive its vital but flagging tourism industry.",A large cache of mummified animals found in an ancient Egyptian necropolis have been displayed for the first time near the capital Cairo.
"Americans will vote for members of both chambers of Congress, as well as for governors in 36 out of 50 states. Between now and then, we'll bring you updates and all the best analysis every weekday in this round-up. Today's round-up includes a plethora of Pelosis and blowback for a possible candidate. One number If the Democrats win control of the House of Representatives, as they are hopeful of doing, Nancy Pelosi is likely to return to her role as Speaker, essentially becoming the most powerful Democrat in office. The move wouldn't be popular with all Democrats. Many feel she may not be the best person to usher in a new era for the party, and have said they would not vote for her as leader. And it would certainly not be popular on the other side of the aisle - the president himself has called her ""the unhinged face of the Democrat Party"". Pelosi's name was brought up so often in one debate on Monday, you would have thought she was the one running for the House seat in Virginia's seventh district. Republican incumbent Dave Brat mentioned Pelosi's name 21 times in a little more than 80 minutes, trying to link challenger Abigail Spanberger to what he called Pelosi's ""agenda of Resist"". At the sixth reference, members of the audience began chuckling. By the seventh, the laughing was so loud it interrupted Brat's answer (watch from the half-hour mark here). The use of ""Pelosi"" as a byword for liberal values has been a trend among Republicans this year - Politico found that ads attacking her or Hillary Clinton had aired 34,000 times this year. Among the regular accusations in the ads are that Pelosi supports sanctuary cities for migrants, and wants to raise taxes. This was Brat's line of attack on Monday night too. His district is one Democrats hope to flip, and even though Brat won 60.8% of the vote in 2014, it is too close to call this year. One controversy On Monday, we brought you the news that Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democratic senator who's up for re-election, had appeared to launch a 2020 presidential campaign with this video: Warren's seat is one of the safest in the country, so it's perhaps understandable that she's looking beyond the mid-terms. Not everyone is seeing it that way though, and she's faced quite a bit of flak for what some say is a distraction for Democrats before the mid-terms. Jim Messina, Barack Obama's former campaign chief, was one to weigh in: Maybe it would have been better for her to do the respectful thing like everyone else and wait until the morning after the mid-terms before launching her presidential campaign. One game Whatever happens in Congress on 6 November will have profound consequences on the next two years in the US.

"In the past the Education Department has been reluctant to publish results that show direct comparisons with schools in the UK. It says because of the selective nature of secondary schools in particular, it was unfair to show how exam results differ. It now plans to be more open about the way schools are performing. Education Minister, Deputy Rod Bryans, said it would mean parents are better informed when they discuss matters with schools. He said: ""The aim is to give people what they want; more information about the school system that is factual, robust and in a consistent professional format. ""This data will mean parents are better informed when they discuss education issues in future. We will continue to provide more relevant information as and when it becomes available."" Attendance records Along with A Level and GSCE results, how primary school pupils are doing will also be featured. National Curriculum Teacher Assessments at Key Stage one and Key Stage two will be released at the end of the year. Reports on attendance and absences will also be published. Justin Donovan, the Director of Education, said the reports would build on what parents already know. He said: ""I am hoping the information will help explain the difference between fee paying and States schools. ""What we are also looking to do is provide an annual report for each school that sets out the context for each school. ""We are going to focus on the progress a student makes. For some getting a grade C when you have been struggling is a major achievement.""",Direct comparisons between schools will be published by Jersey's Education Department for the first time.
"By Owen AmosBBC News, Washington DC Where were you when Kennedy was shot? Toni Glover was there, in Dallas, watching by the side of the road. She was 11 years old. ""I had a troubled childhood,"" she says. ""I thought if I could get Kennedy to look at me, and wave at me, that would mean we had a personal relationship, and everything at home would be perfect. ""It was magical thinking from an 11-year-old."" Toni got to the Dealey Plaza early and found a ""perfect"" spot to watch the president's parade. ""He came by, he smiled and waved,"" she says. ""Jackie smiled and waved - she was on my side. ""He turned the corner. I thought, 'I'm going to follow this car until it disappears because it's the president - I'm going to watch every second I can.' ""And then his head exploded. It just exploded."" She told her mother that someone had thrown fireworks into the car. ""But really, I knew different,"" she adds. Now, 54 years later, Dr Toni Glover is an associate professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. ""I believe in facts,"" she says. ""I went to a (JFK) conference where there were a number of conspiracy people. Some of it is insane. Some of it is absolutely crazy."" And yet… ""There are some legitimate investigators that have a question or two that they've almost answered."" What happened? John F Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was shot dead on 22 November 1963. He was travelling in an open-topped limousine. The Governor of Texas John Connally, who was sitting in front of the president, was wounded but survived. Within an hour, Dallas policeman JD Tippit was also killed. Soon afterwards, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested. Within 12 hours, he was charged with the killings of President Kennedy and JD Tippit. On 24 November, Oswald was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas police department by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner. The shooting was captured live on television. Ruby was convicted of killing Oswald and sentenced to death. He appealed but died of cancer in 1967, before the retrial. What was the official explanation? A week after Kennedy was killed, President Lyndon B Johnson set up a commission to investigate the case. The Warren Commission's report, published in September 1964, said that: There were other investigations: In 1992, a law passed by Congress meant all assassination-related records - around five million pages - were transferred to the National Archives. Around 88% of the records are open in full; 11% are open but with ""sensitive portions"" removed; and 1% are withheld in full. According to the 1992 law, all records must be published in full within 25 years, unless the president says otherwise. The deadline is Thursday. What other theories are there? Toni Glover - who saw the killing aged 11 - thinks there may have been a second shooter. Some people believe the ""other"" gunman fired from the ""grassy knoll"", which the president's limousine passed. Toni thinks the second shooter - if there was one - could have been on the other side of the road. ""There's fairly substantial evidence,"" she says. ""It has some validity to it."" Jefferson Morley is a former Washington Post reporter who has written several books on the killing - including one, out this week, about former CIA counter-intelligence chief James Angleton. ""I've never written about a conspiracy theory,"" he says. ""I report new facts about the assassination."" He ""tends to doubt"" that Oswald shot JFK. He says it's more likely the fatal shot came from in front of Kennedy - rather than behind. ""Look at the Zapruder film,"" says Morley, referring to the famous home-movie footage of the killing. ""Kennedy's head goes flying backwards. ""I know there's a theory that if you get hit by a bullet from behind, the head goes towards the source of the bullet. But as a common sense explanation, it seems very unlikely. ""That sure looks like a shot from the front."" Morley has other reasons to doubt the official story. A paraffin test on Oswald's cheek, after he was arrested, suggested he hadn't fired a rifle (the test's reliability has been questioned). John Connally - the Texas governor who was also travelling in the president's car - said he was not hit by the same bullet as Kennedy, contradicting the Warren Commission's findings. And Morley thinks other parts of the official explanation don't add up. ""The official story - there was this guy Oswald, who nobody knew anything about, who came out of nowhere and shot the president - that story we know, beyond a reasonable doubt, is false,"" he says. ""Oswald was monitored by the counter-intelligence staff of the CIA and by James Angleton for four years - from December 1959 when they opened their first file, to November 1963."" But Thomas Whalen, an author and associate professor at Boston University, thinks Oswald did shoot JFK. ""And not just me, but in general, historians believe he was the assassin. The big question is - was he involved in a broader conspiracy?"" While the Warren Commission said Oswald acted alone, it did note that he travelled to the Soviet Union in 1959, unsuccessfully applied for Soviet citizenship, and lived there until 1962. It also found that Oswald - a self-proclaimed Marxist - visited the Cuban and Russian embassies in Mexico City in September 1963, two months before Kennedy was shot. Whalen says the newly released documents may shed light on this trip. ""What was Oswald doing in Mexico City weeks before the assassination? Did he meet Cuban and Soviet intelligence officials? Did they give him a green light? ""Certainly Fidel Castro (Cuban prime minister, then president) had motive to kill President Kennedy. We - we being the United States government - were trying to kill him."" What might the new documents show? Bruce Miroglio, a lawyer from St Helena, California, has read ""many thousands"" of books on Kennedy and his assassination. ""In fact, I'm sitting in my office looking at the 26 volumes of the Warren Report,"" he says. Although he says the report made mistakes, he ""basically supports"" its conclusions. He does not believe there was a second gunman, is ""sceptical"" of conspiracy theories, and is not expecting huge revelations in Thursday's documents. ""The number of people that would be involved in the cover-up is so vast, it seems almost impossible they would keep anything earth-shattering under wraps,"" he says. Toni Glover says it will be ""interesting"" to see what emerges. She, though, will remain a witness, rather than an investigator. ""I can't validate anything,"" she says. ""I was at an exuberant presidential parade, everybody hopping up and down, thrilled out of their mind. ""Fifteen seconds later we were in abject dread.""","On Thursday, classified files about the Kennedy assassination will be released - but what might they show?"
"The last time it was held in Australia, in Melbourne in 2006, there were violent clashes between police and demonstrators. This conference, in Brisbane, will see Australia's biggest deployment of police and soldiers, and police have been given extended powers. Twenty-seven different groups have been given permits to protest at designated areas and thousands of people are expected over the weekend. But there is an eclectic list of items which they will not be allowed to take into the security buffer zone near the venue. Eggs In fact, no projectiles at all. The examples given are ""stones, ball bearings or eggs"". Animal manure, and any other ""noxious or offensive substance"", are also out. Weapons Unsurprisingly, any kind of weapon is banned. The list includes longbows, spear guns, bolt guns, arrows, blowpipes, swords, antique firearms and explosives. Climbing No climbing ""onto, under, over or around"" barriers erected by the G20 security. Large signs Protest signs are welcome - and as ever, are likely to be creative in their criticisms of world leaders. But the legislation contains specific restrictions on the size of banners and placards allowed. They must be no more than 100cm high x 200cm wide. Political billboards Brisbane Airport, which will welcome world leaders to the summit, would not allow two adverts to be displayed on the grounds they were overly political. One of the adverts campaigned against climate change, the other corruption. In a statement the airport said ""we believe the airport shouldn't be used as a platform for partisan views, whether we agree with those views or not"". Kayaks The laws forbid ""a manually operated surf ski or surfboard, kayak, boat or canoe"". Fires Do not start fires near the G20 summit. But you can be exempt from this rule with a lawful excuse. The very Australian example given is ""a chef at a restaurant in a declared area who lights a gas barbecue"". Masks Masked protestors have been a feature of previous G20 summits, but this one bans masks, balaclavas, and anything capable of disguising or concealing a person's identity. There are exceptions for religious clothing, which is pertinent given Australia's recent political wrangling over Islamic attire. Reptiles Bad news for anyone wanting to bring a pet snake to a protest. ""A reptile, insect or other animal capable of causing physical harm if released in close proximity to a person"" are all prohibited. Kites ""... or other device suspended by airflow and controlled by a string or cord attached to it."" Toy cars and model planes are out too. And one that was not banned...

In a 2015 piece for the newspaper, Ms Wurtzel wrote about being diagnosed with breast cancer and having chemotherapy and a double mastectomy. Following news of her death on Tuesday, tributes were paid on social media. ""It's impossible to convey the impact Elizabeth Wurtzel had in the '90s. She was unapologetic, raw, honest.

"Nick Le Cornu has called an extraordinary parish assembly to put parishioners views on the issue to Constable Simon Crowcroft. The Electoral Commission will look at the make up of the States of Jersey. Mr Le Cornu does not feel politicians should be on the commission. The States will decide if an electoral commission should be independent in March. Extraordinary meeting Senator Bailhache, Jersey's former bailiff, was chief judge and president of the States of Jersey and said it was important to have States members in the electoral commission because it was the members who would have to decide whether to accept the proposals. St Clement resident Mike Dunn was in the first group of residents to call an extraordinary meeting on this issue. He used an old Jersey law that means if four residents request it a meeting can be called on a subject to be debated in the States in the parish hall. Mr Dunn said: ""People have got the intelligence to do it so let people have a go. Obviously there are a group of States members who are terrified of letting the public have control. ""This is an extraordinarily old law that allows people to take control of things. It allows people to express their views, to call the constable and to call a meeting."" Mr Le Cornu said he hoped people would turn up to petition the Constable of St Helier to vote in favour of Deputy Roy Le Herissier's amendment to remove politicians from the panel. He said: ""If there is going to be genuine independence and a genuine objective outcome to the review it is important States members don't sit there.""",St Helier residents are being asked their views on the presence of politicians on a political review body.
"""Come to an all-night prayer vigil to welcome the ember months,"" read a text from my mother. It was an August ritual she had reminded me about severally. ""I have something to do next tomorrow,"" I texted back from the barbing salon. ""You sef,"" came her instant reply, half-irritated, half-rebuking. What I considered to be a conversation in perfect English between my mother and me would have been regarded as wrong by the self-appointed language police here. But now I have something with which I can defend myself, thanks to the OED, which calls itself ""the definitive record of the English language"". The Oxford lexicographers have updated the dictionary with 29 Nigerian words, recognising the ""unique and distinctive contribution to English as a global language"" of Africa's most populous country. OED definitions ember monthsThe final four months of the calendar year severallyOn several occasions; repeatedly next tomorrowThe day after tomorrow barbing salonA barber-shop sefUsed for emphasis after a statement or rhetorical question I wish I could show the list of new entries to my former boss. Once, when I was a radio presenter, he came rushing into the studio after I had used ""severally"" on air, which I had always thought was ""proper English"". He saw himself a stickler for what was correct and gave me an earful about my education that left me flummoxed. But it is unlikely that he, and others like him, will be satisfied with the OED's intervention. 'I don't care what Brits think' The OED's move has divided opinion in the former British colony of 200 million people, who between them speak more than 250 languages. English is the official language in this polyglot nation and the one used in schools. There are those who think the idea that an expert sitting in Oxford can define how it is spoken is outmoded. ""I don't care what the Brits think of Nigerian English,"" one writer curtly replied when I asked his opinion. He declined to be interviewed, as did two other writers. OED definitions chop-chopBribery and corruption in public life gistIdle chat or gossip mama putA street vendor, typically a woman, selling cooked food okadaA motorcycle which passengers can use as a taxi service to rub mindsTo consider a matter jointly; to consult and work together send-forthA celebration or event to mark a person's departure But there are the fundamentalists befuddled by what they consider ""street words"" having made it into the dictionary. ""What we expected was a formalisation of Pidgin,"" said Uzoh Nwamara, chairman of a local authors' organisation. Pidgin, a mix of local languages and English, has become the lingua franca here and is gaining respectability, not least from the BBC, which has its own Pidgin service. ""But to leave Pidgin and go tamper with the [colonial] master's language... well,"" Nwamara hissed as we spoke over the phone. I imagined he shrugged his shoulders in that typical Nigerian way that means ""What nonsense!"". 'Last word on words' Some of the words now included in the OED, for example ""sef"", ""chop-chop"" and ""gist"", have derived their meaning from the way that Pidgin speakers use them. The OED has described most of the 29 new entries as ""either borrowings from Nigerian languages or unique Nigerian coinages"". The publishers say its dictionary has been the ""last word on words for over a century"" and entries are considered on the basis of widespread use and published evidence. But Nigerian historian, Timi Soleye, thinks the OED may have gone too far. ""It is possible that in an attempt to be inclusive, they have made wrong calls,"" he said. He told the BBC that he had no problem with the nouns, such as ""okada"" and ""danfo"", but he had issues with the addition of some of the verbs and adverbs. ""They added 'sef'. 'Sef' is like a verbal exclamation to add emphasis but you go to the dictionary entry, 'sef' has no etymological roots,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean anything. It is completely useless. It is not even a corruption from another language. What is 'sef'? ""This amounts to accepting the debasement of English grammar,"" he added with a deep sigh. He described it as the ""Pidginification"" of the English language and that the OED has gone down the wrong path for the wrong reason. ""People should feel free to speak Pidgin but Pidgin isn't English."" For the record, the OED cites the use of ""sef"" by author Ben Okri in his 1980 book Flowers and Shadows. But in accepting Nigerian words, along with past inclusions from the rest of the English-speaking world, the lexicographers have recognised what this country's literary giant Chinua Achebe wrote in 1975. ""The price a world language must be prepared to pay is submission to many different kinds of use,"" he said in a passage about how an African writer should use English. English here has evolved to incorporate the rhythms and accents of indigenous languages and developed new pronunciations. 'I write how I speak' Nigerian writers began to reflect this in their published works from the middle of the last century, and that has continued to this day. ""When I wrote my novel, I wrote in the language I knew how to speak which I later learnt was Nigerian English,"" author and publisher Eghosa Imasuen said. Words not yet in the OED konkTo knock on the head using the knuckles ruggedityPidgin noun deriving from rugged parte after parteNon-stop partying akaraDeep-fried balls of ground beans moi-moiSteamed and flavoured cakes of ground beans Imasuen's book Fine Boys, which was published in 2012, is about freshmen in a Nigerian university who got embroiled in gang fights. He used ""okada"" and many other Nigerian English words such as ""konk"" (meaning knock) and ""ruggedity"" (a Pidgin noun deriving from rugged). ""The fact that some of these words are only just being included in the dictionary does not mean that people have not been using them,"" Imasuen said. And more Nigerian English words are being considered for inclusion, Kingsley Ugwuanyi, the Nigerian consultant who worked with the OED on the 29 words, told the BBC. This ""has put Nigeria on the map of the English-speaking world. [But] Oxford is not validating Nigerian English, only recognising previous efforts made by researchers,"" he said, trying to correct the impression that the OED is telling people how to speak. You may also like: And can I suggest a couple of words to be added?

"Riot police in Rio de Janeiro had encircled the area early on Saturday expecting a court order to evict them. The building is meant to be demolished as part of preparations for next year's World Cup. Community leaders said they were ready to fight back with bows and arrows. Campaigners say the eviction and demolition of the historic building - Rio's former indigenous museum, built in 1862 - are unnecessary. The community, known as Aldeia Maracana (or Maracana tribe), settled in the disused building six years ago. 'Tourist attraction' Brazilian authorities say the area needs to be cleared for the circulation of fans during the 2014 World Cup. Rio's governor Sergio Cabral recently said the demolition was being demanded by the Fifa, the international football federation. But Fifa's office in Brazil issued a letter denying the claim, says the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio. There are plans to build a car park in the area. A nearby state school is also due to be demolished, despite protests by parents. Several matches will be played in Brazil's biggest and most famous stadium, including the World Cup final. When it reopens, in the next few months, it will have a total capacity of 78,000 spectators. Maracana will also host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Olympics. The old Indigenous Museum, which belongs to the federal government, is in urgent need of repair. More than 20 families live there, planting traditional herbs and tobacco. Campaign groups have tried to save it and keep the indigenous community where it has lived for the past six years. The community hoped to be able to showcase their way of life to tourists during the World Cup. Opposition legislator at the Rio de Janeiro Assembly Marcelo Freixo said tourists ""would rather see a historic building next to the stadium than a car park or fast food joint"". A legal battle has been going on for months. The local authorities have failed to get the court order, but campaigners expect the local authorities to continue pursuing the eviction in the next few days.",A Brazilian indigenous community that has been facing eviction from a building next to the Maracana football stadium has celebrated the police's decision to leave the area.

We got down under the seats of the bus,"" recalls the journalist who was in the convoy just a few vehicles behind the emir's blue classic car. Emir Al Haji Ado Bayero survived but his driver and three bodyguards were killed, apparently valiantly shielding him from the gunmen. ""I was very scared and I couldn't sleep for two days because I was wondering what condition the emir was in,"" says Mr Dalatu. His comments reflect the high regard many here have for the religious leader. 'Respect declined' At the emir's offices near the palace in Kano, there are plenty of worried-looking faces. For many it was unthinkable that gunmen would attack the man seen as the second most important Muslim leader in the country, after the sultan of Sokoto. ""We are shocked. They shot at him from all sides just like hunting animals in the bush,"" says Abbas Sanusi, the emir's senior counsel. He says that they have no idea who might have been responsible for the attack. The words are chosen carefully. Even though many analysts suggest this was the work of the Islamist militant group popularly known as Boko Haram, palace officials do not draw this conclusion. It may be safer not to mention the Islamist militants at all. However, there are some in northern Nigeria who were not surprised at the assassination attempt. ""The masses have found out that the emirs and chiefs are now stooges of the political class and this must stop,"" says a former military governor in north-western Nigeria, Usman Faruk. He says that the budgets of these rulers are largely paid by politicians - and as a consequence traditional and religious leaders are caught up in politics and have lost their independence. ""He who pays the piper dictates the tunes,"" says Mr Faruk, who chairs the Northern Development Focus Initiative. ""Their respect has declined and will continue to unless they stick to their own jobs. ""The Muslim and Christian leaders should not rely on goodies given to them."" 'Drastic consequences' In July and August 2012 suicide bombers tried but failed to kill the shehu - or traditional ruler - of the Borno emirate in north-east Nigeria as well as the emir of Fika in Yobe state. Those attacks were widely blamed on Boko Haram. The majority of Boko Haram's targets have been linked to the government - either police, military or other local officials. So could it be that Boko Haram sees religious and traditional leaders as legitimate targets? ""We do not think the attack happened because of religion or politics,"" says Mr Sanusi. ""The emir is over 80 years old and has been on the throne for 50 years and you can't say he's been involved in politics,"" the adviser explained. The attack has had drastic consequences for tens of thousands of young men, who face losing their means of earning their living. Because the gunmen are reported to have fled on the back of motorbikes, Kano state has banned such machines, known as ""achaba"", from being used as taxis. ""One person, one bike"" is the rule. ""This is the only job we have. We depend on it to get something to eat and to look after our families,"" says Muhammad Sani Hassan, chair of the Kano branch of the Commercial Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association of Nigeria. He says that no members of the association have given lifts to gunmen carrying out attacks. ""The only thing you can blame some of our members for is recklessness on the road,"" Mr Hassan says. ""By banning us you are now opening another door of criminality,"" he said, urging the state government to provide alternative jobs or training. Kano Governor Musa Rabiu Kwankwaso disputes the idea that banning the bikes is only going to deepen poverty and drive recruits into the hands of criminal groups, including Boko Haram. He says that Kano's government is creating jobs. ""We decided to buy 1,000 taxis, which we are giving to young men on hire purchase,"" he said. ""There are also 500 buses and we have 250 brand new Toyota Corollas which will be used as luxury taxis."" 'Begging' The fact that all these vehicles are exclusively earmarked for diploma and degree holders says a great deal about the lack of job opportunities in Nigeria. Mr Kwankwaso also argues that motorbike taxi riders have been told to register with the local government and that a return to the streets of two-wheeled taxis has not entirely been ruled out if security improves. But he suggests the high rate of accidents involving these bikes - more than 10,000 in 2012 with 2,000 deaths - means Kano would be better off without them. For the tens of thousands who are suddenly out of work, the ban is a crisis. ""We are begging. We are borrowing money from people as most of us doing this job spend what we earn each day,"" says Mr Hassan, who had been riding his taxi for 20 years. Compared to other parts of Nigeria, the north is severely underdeveloped. In parts of it as many as 70% of the children do not get any education beyond studying the Koran. While the Boko Haram name roughly translates as ""Western education is forbidden"" many experts would argue that education is the key to lifting the area onto a more stable footing. ""The main source of recruitment is people who are illiterate. You give them naira and they will go and kill for you. It's happened here in Kano for 30,000 naira ($190, £120),"" says Mr Faruk. He says that for many years a lack of education has been a major contributor to insecurity in Nigeria. ""If a boy is trained up to secondary school or diploma level even if there's no job in the government, by virtue of the education he has been enlightened and he will find a job for himself,"" he says. ""If you leave him untrained he is ready fodder for any insecurity in this country. To prevent insecurity we have to go back to school."" It will take at least a generation before any investment in education yields results. Right now for so many people in northern Nigeria the focus is on short-term survival - how to feed the family and how to stay safe from the guns and bombs. As one resident of Kano put it: ""If the emir of Kano is not safe then who is?""","""We suddenly saw them running towards the convoy, shooting again and again,"" says Muhammad Dalatu, remembering the recent attack on one of Nigeria's most revered Muslim leaders, the emir of Kano."
"Ms Ardern said her cabinet had backed gun law changes ""in principle"". Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Police say the killer used military-style assault weapons modified to make them more deadly - which is not illegal under current legislation. What has the cabinet agreed? The prime minister gave no details at her press conference on Monday but said they would made clear soon. ""This ultimately means that within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms which will, I believe, make our community safer,"" she said. Ms Ardern was appearing alongside her coalition partner and Deputy PM Winston Peters, who has previously opposed changes to gun laws. Mr Peters said he fully supported the prime minister on the issue, adding: ""The reality is that after 1pm on Friday, our world changed forever and so will our laws."" Ms Ardern said: ""We have made a decision as a cabinet. We are unified."" She also announced that an inquiry would look into the lead-up to the attacks, and what might have been done differently. What do we know about the guns used? At the weekend, Ms Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. Earlier on Monday, gun retailer Gun City said it had sold four weapons to the alleged gunman online, but it did not sell him the high-powered weapon used in the mosque shootings. CEO David Tipple told a news conference in Christchurch it had only sold him A-category weapons. Under New Zealand's gun laws, A-category weapons can be semi-automatic but limited to seven shots. Video footage of the attacks appeared to show the gunman's weapon had a magazine with a larger capacity, which is also available legally. There are an estimated 1.5 million privately owned firearms in the country. Since the attack there have been calls for semi-automatic weapons to be banned. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws have failed due to a strong gun lobby and a culture of hunting. New Zealand's gun laws What do we know about the footage of the attack? Footage of the killings was live-streamed by the attacker. On Sunday police said it was now classified as an objectionable publication and therefore it was an offence to distribute or possess the material. An 18-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream. The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. Emotion still raw By Jay Savage, BBC News, Christchurch Many returned to work and school on Monday, but little about it felt ordinary. If anything, the signs of the city's emotions became more visible. Flowers left at the main tribute site swelled, easily doubling what was there a day earlier. Outside Al Noor mosque, hundreds of people attended an afternoon vigil. It featured a thundering haka, performed by dozens of schoolchildren. Other students stood together singing softly or linking arms in silence. A few cried openly. The importance of coming together was the main topic of conversation. What is the latest on the victims? Nine people remain in hospital in a critical condition. Frustration is building among relatives over the release of the bodies of the dead for burial. The first release was approved on Sunday but the family say another relative was killed and they want them released together. No burials will take place on Monday. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death. And on the suspected gunman? Brenton Tarrant on Monday fired his state-appointed lawyer, Richard Peters. Mr Peters says the defendant has indicated he ""wants to be self-represented in this case"". The lawyer added: ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. He seemed to understand what was going on."" Australian police raided two homes near Sydney on Monday as part of the inquiry. Australian media reported that one of the homes belongs to Brenton Tarrant's sister. The family is co-operating with the authorities. An uncle of Brenton Tarrant said: ""We are so sorry for the families over there, for the dead and injured."" New Zealand police confirmed on Monday they believed there was only one attacker, but added that this did not rule out others might have provided support.","New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has said she will announce detailed gun law reforms within days, after an attack on two mosques left 50 people dead."
"At least eight islanders died in prisons or detention camps or as a result of ill-treatment after being jailed for resistance. If approved, the memorial will sit with others near the Liberation Monument, at North Beach, St Peter Port. The Environment Department is considering the proposal. The plaque proposal follows a fundraising campaign by the family of one of those who died. Jean Harris, daughter of Joseph Gillingham, said: ""It'll be an honour to see a plaque with his name on it and for others who also gave up their lives for what they did."" Her husband, Alan, said if the plans were approved ""a number of relatives of some of the people who died will be coming over from the UK to be at the unveiling"". Proposed wording of memorial ""This memorial is dedicated to the memory of all islanders who committed acts of protest, defiance and resistance during the German Occupation 1940-1945, those who were imprisoned or deported, those who died in captivity."" Underneath that would sit the names of those who died: Charles Machon, Percy Miller, Marie Ozanne, Joseph Gillingham, Sidney Ashcroft, Louis Symes and John Ingrouille An eighth person who died has not been included by name as their family has asked for their details to be kept private. The plans have been submitted by the island's museums service, which is responsible for maintenance of current memorials. Museums director Dr Jason Monaghan said the new memorial had already been funded through public subscriptions, and the historic sites team would take responsibility for it - including installing it and maintenance. The proposal would see the moving of a current memorial to three Jewish women who were deported during the Occupation and who later died in Auschwitz. Dr Monaghan said: ""What we're proposing to do is install the new resistance plaque between the Jewish women's plaque, the evacuees' plaque and the deportees' plaque so they're all fairly symmetrically laid out, and just rearrange the benches so it's nicely balanced up. ""The idea is that the new stone will be in place for Liberation Day."" Asked if this would be the last memorial erected to mark the island's occupation during World War Two he said: ""It's not necessarily the last one. ""We've worked with various different groups in the past putting the memorials up one by one, and it's the turn of the resistance memorial."" Dr Gilly Carr, from Cambridge University, who studied resistance in the Channel Islands, previously said resistance in the island was a subject that divided Guernsey. However, she added that she felt those who had committed such acts should be acknowledged as heroes of the occupation period. Occupation of the Channel Islands",People who resisted the Nazi occupation of Guernsey in World War Two could be honoured if plans to erect a plaque are approved.
"Recep Gultekin was shot in the leg while aiding the woman with his friend, Mikail Özen. They also carried an injured police officer to safety after a Palestinian man, Osama Joda, gave him first aid. Five people, including an attacker, were killed and another 22 wounded as firing broke out opposite a synagogue in the Austrian capital. The man accused of carrying out the attack was a 20-year-old ""Islamist terrorist"" who was released early from jail in December, and shot dead by police during the incident. Mr Joda, 23, was working at a nearby McDonalds, and told local newspaper Kurier that he was carrying goods into the restaurant when the attacker began shooting at passers-by. When two police officers came to help, the attacker opened fire on them and one was struck by a bullet. ""I pulled him behind the concrete bench and tried to stop the bleeding,"" said Mr Joda. ""There was blood everywhere."" The perpetrator fled after more police arrived at the scene, and Mr Joda then helped to drag the officer to a nearby ambulance. He was assisted in this by Mr Özen and Mr Gultekin, who are both of Turkish descent. Earlier Mr Gultekin, 21, had carried the injured woman to a restaurant. Mr Özen, a mixed martial artist and personal trainer, told Kurier that they then noticed the policeman bleeding on the floor after gunfire erupted. ""We knew immediately what to do, there was no choice but to help,"" said the 25-year-old. ""Austria is our home. We would help at any time."" Police have not confirmed details of the incident, but Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told local media that the officer was taken to safety by Austrians with a migrant background. ""No terrorist attack will succeed in tearing up or dividing our society,"" he added. Turkey's ambassador to Austria, Ozan Ceyhun, also hosted Mr Özen and Mr Gultekin at the Turkish embassy and praised their conduct. Security has been tight in Vienna as police launched a manhunt for further attackers, and 14 people have been arrested after a series of police raids. But authorities believe the gunman killed by police may have acted alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young male passer-by and a waitress. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", the chancellor said. Do you have any information you can share?

"President Ashraf Ghani said the assault near the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif had been contrary to all human values and Islamic teachings. Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said. Some of the survivors suggested the attackers had had inside help. One of the injured soldiers said: ""When an attacker enters the base, why was he not challenged? There is not just one barrier or security gate, there are seven or eight."" The Taliban in a statement said it had carried out the attack, one of the deadliest on a military site in a country that has seen numerous insurgent attacks. The fighters, dressed in Afghan military uniforms and driving military vehicles, made their way into the compound before opening fire, the army said. At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained. The Afghan defence ministry did not release exact figures for Friday's attack, only saying more than 100 soldiers had died or been injured. But other officials, speaking anonymously, said the death toll was at least 140. ""Three months ago I sent my son to the army, I have not seen him since then,"" one father told AFP news agency. ""And today, they give me his remains."" President Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops. The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting. Several German and other foreign soldiers are reported to be garrisoned there. Meanwhile, the US military command in Afghanistan said that Taliban commander Quari Tayib had been killed in a coalition air strike. It said that Tayib was ""once known as the shadow Taliban governor of Takhar province"" in the north-east, and was killed along with eight other Taliban fighters in the strike on 17 April.","Afghanistan is holding a day of national mourning after the Taliban attacked an army base, killing or wounding more than 100 soldiers."
"Craig Anderson, of Ramsey, admitted giving a false name when he arrived at Douglas ferry terminal on 10 January. The 28-year-old lied about his identity in order to avoid being caught breaching court bail conditions relating to an alleged driving offence. Anderson had left the island on 30 December to visit friends in the UK. Current Isle of Man border restrictions mean all new arrivals must fill out a landing card and obey a strict isolation and testing regime. Douglas Courthouse heard Anderson, of Gladstone Avenue, attracted the suspicion when he used a bank card bearing the name Nathan Jackson as proof of his identity. When asked to fill out a second landing card by port security, he again used the assumed name but signed the form with his own signature. He was reported to police and arrested. Anderson's lawyer said his client had made a ""foolish decision"" to visit the UK but had intended to self-isolate on his return. Passing sentence, High Bailiff Jayne Hughes said Anderson's attempt to deceive port staff had potentially posed a ""great risk"" to the people of the island.

"By Yvette TanBBC News While people around the globe were panic buying and stocking up, he was running low on food and fuel as he sailed between islands trying to find somewhere to dock. Wong - he only wanted to share his surname - set off from his home country Singapore on 2 February. It was an adventure the 59-year-old experienced sailor had been meticulously planning for years - everything from the exact amount of fuel he would need to the weather conditions of the places he was intending to visit. The plan was to sail from Singapore to Polynesia, a journey that would take about four months, in his yacht. Once there, he would spend time exploring the region by land and sea. But he would soon learn that even the best laid plans could go awry - especially in the face of a global pandemic. A turn for the worse For the first leg of his journey, Wong was joined by two friends who accompanied him in the initial stages of his journey. In late February, they disembarked in Indonesia as scheduled and Wong headed on alone to his destination of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where he planned to stock up on fuel and food. But a few days in, his auto-pilot broke. ""I was still in Indonesian waters then so I wanted to anchor and take a break and repair my boat. But I was chased away - they said the lockdown had already begun,"" he told the BBC. ""So I thought OK I would just continue on."" A broken autopilot meant he needed to man the ship at all times. At night, he would set his alarm to ring once every hour, so he could wake up to check his whereabouts. And his luck did not improve. As he neared PNG, he found out from his family - whom he kept in touch with by satellite phone - that it had also closed its borders. He decided he would stop at a small island close by instead. ""It was a small island, only around 20-30 families lived there. There was no telephone, no television, nothing,"" he said. ""But even they had heard of the lockdown, so they chased me away. I approached several other islands but they all chased me away. ""It was then that I got news that the South Pacific islands were all in lockdown, but I was already halfway there - I couldn't really turn back. So I decided to just continue to Tuvalu."" That leg of the journey would take the next 13 days. It was 21 April when he reached Tuvalu. By this time, he had already spent weeks alone on his boat, and his supplies were running dangerously low. ""My initial plan, if there was no virus, was that I would stop at each country for a while, buy some fuel and food,"" he said. ""By this time, the vegetables were all spoilt but I still could keep things like meat and things like potatoes as I had a fridge on board."" He was about two hours from Tuvalu waters when he was discovered by maritime officials - who again, told him to leave. ""I pleaded with them and said 'Please, I don't have any more fuel and food. I won't anchor and step on land, just let me stay in your waters,'"" he said. But they said no. ""I said I didn't have anywhere to go and they said to head back to the ocean. At last I said ok at least help me buy some food and fuel."" He passed them nearly US$1,400 (£1,133) in exchange for 1,000 litres of diesel and approximately a month's worth of food. A boat carrying both these things eventually arrived, but they couldn't approach Wong due to social distancing rules. ""I pulled out my small rubber boat and pushed it their way, and they put the goods there and I would tow it back. We took a lot of time pulling it back and forth."" So he left, deciding to head towards Fiji. During this time, his family back home in Singapore got in touch with Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and tried to secure a place for him to dock in Fiji. All he could do then was wait and hope for the best. His options were running low but then he hit a real low point after his boat hit coral. ""It was sometime in April that my propeller was damaged. I remember on that day, huge winds started picking up - they were really strong,"" he said. He later found out that he was some 500 nautical miles (926 km) away from Cyclone Harold - the storm that ravaged the Pacific Islands, killing dozens. ""I was very far away but I still felt it. The winds blew my boat and it hit something, causing one of my propellers to spoil,"" he said. 'I will continue my voyage' But thankfully, he soon received word that the Fiji government had agreed to take him in. ""I was so happy and relieved when Fiji let me in, I was really thankful to the Fijian government and to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for co-ordinating,"" he said. A navy boat was sent out to tow him in and he eventually docked in Fiji on 29 April - after almost three months of wandering the sea. ""Mr Wong was fatigued after incurring damages to his yacht and had minimal rest and [was] running short of food supplies,"" Commander Tim Natuva of the Fiji Navy told BBC News. Cmdr Natuva said the rescue effort required co-ordination from Singapore and multiple ministries in Fiji including customs, immigration, navy and the ministry of health. Fiji, which has a population of about 880,000, currently has 18 confirmed cases of the virus - one of the few nations in the South Pacific to have any reported virus cases. Cmdr Natuva said the rescue itself was ""fairly simple"" but ""needed some adjustments"" because of the virus restrictions. But it was a success - Wong eventually managed to dock. He was taken to hospital where he had to undergo a swab test. The test, of course, came back negative. ""If it had come back positive - I really don't know how that would have happened! I hadn't seen anyone for months at that point!"" he joked. When asked how he felt about being rejected from every country, his tone remained upbeat, saying: ""Those countries did what they had to do. If they had let me in and someone had gotten the virus from me, how could they explain the incident to their citizens? ""One thing that surprised me was that even those small islands with no wifi and television, even they felt the effects of the virus so strongly. I really felt for them."" Wong has since been discharged but remains in Fiji working on repairing his yacht, waiting for the chance to resume his trip. ""I hope this outbreak is something we'll all be able to get through,"" he said. ""And after this all ends, I will continue my voyage.""","One man's dream to spend three years sailing solo around the Pacific nearly turned to disaster after borders started closing around the region, leaving him stranded alone at sea for three months."
"Nick BryantNew York correspondent The summer of 2015 saw Trump generate so much early momentum behind his candidacy that he became almost unstoppable in his march towards the Republican presidential nomination. By Labor Day in early September, he had established a lead in the polls that rarely he relinquished. The summer of 2016, by contrast, may well have made him unelectable as he pursues the presidency itself. By Labor Day, he could be so far behind that Hillary Clinton, hardly a popular candidate herself, would have to trip badly for him to stage a comeback. Already, the polls point towards the first Democratic hat-trick of three consecutive victories in presidential elections since the 1940s. As Politico reported last week: ""No candidate in Donald Trump's position at this stage of the campaign has gone on to win the popular vote in November in the modern polling era."" The personal insults, the rollicking rhetoric, the Twitter rants, the blatant falsehoods that originally powered his candidacy have more recently become acts of self-harm, whether it has been inviting ""Second Amendment people"" to stop Hillary Clinton or quarrelling with the Khan family. The words ""Clinton landslide"" have been uttered for the first time. Republicans, fearful of a Goldwater-style rout, have even explored ways of firing him as their candidate. A key difference between last year's summer of Trumpian love and the dog days of the past few weeks is that the electorate he is seeking to woo has changed, but the billionaire continues to rely on his old seductive tricks. Campaigning for the presidency is not the same as campaigning for the presidential nomination. The demographics are vastly different - in most primary states, more than 90% of Republican voters were white. Wild statements come under greater scrutiny when voters are choosing a commander in chief as opposed to be a party nominee. Temperament looms larger. With so much more at stake, voters are more mindful that the finger punching out those ill-tempered Tweets could soon be hovering above the nuclear button. For all that, Trump has failed to make the transition. After seeing off his Republican rivals in the primaries in the spring, Donald Trump needed to perform two pivots as the election entered its next season: first to appeal more to the broader American electorate, and second to heal the wounds from a bloody primary campaign by reaching out to the 55% of Republican voters who opted for rival candidates. Part of the explanation for his dismal polling - remember the days when Trump's stump speech was essentially a recitation of positive polls numbers? - is that he is running as if the nomination was still his goal rather than the presidency. In this ever-more polarised electorate, the pivot towards swing voters, a staple of campaigns past, is not as important as it once was. As Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur noted recently, ""floating voters"" are thought to comprise only 5% of the electorate compared to 15% in the 1960s. Kapur also reminded us that Mitt Romney won 50% of independent voters - those who do not register as either Democrats or Republicans - compared to Obama's 45%, but still lost the election. Trump's larger problem, at a time when elections are increasingly decided by which party can maximise its turnout, has been his failure to unify the Republican base. All but one of the five living Republican presidential candidates - Bob Dole - boycotted the Republican convention in Cleveland. So, too, did the host governor, Trump's former rival John Kasich, which is doubly problematic since no Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. Six Republican Senators have refused to back him, along with eight House lawmakers and two Republican governors. Then there are the 50 Republican national security experts who have openly voiced opposition, including the former NSA director Michael Hayden and former UN ambassador John Negroponte. Of the two party conventions, the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia may have looked and sounded the more raucous because divisions between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters were on nightly display. But it was the absentees in Cleveland, and those who have come out against Trump since, who were more electorally significant. For all the fractiousness of Philadelphia, polls repeatedly show that Democrats are more loyal to Hillary Clinton than Republicans are to Donald Trump. The property tycoon continues to poll strongly with non-college educated whites, but a big education gap is opening up. As Ron Brownstein recently reported, Trump could become the first Republican in 60 years not to win a majority of college-educated whites. Trump also has a gender problem. Whereas Mitt Romney won more than 90% of Republican women in 2012, polls have suggested that only around 70% of Republican women are prepared to vote for Trump. All this helps explain why some of the Republican states do not now look such a lustrous shade of red as they did on Memorial Day, the unofficial start of summertime. Georgia, which hasn't voted for a Democrat since Bill Clinton carried the state in 1992, is now thought to be competitive. Utah has become an improbable target state for Hillary Clinton because of the antipathy towards Trump from Mormons. Lyndon Johnson was the last Democrat to take it in 1964, in that landslide win over Barry Goldwater. Even at a basic organisational level, Trump is failing, hence the description of him as a candidate without a campaign. For all his much-vaunted business smarts, he made a slow start in raising much-needed funds and has not constructed the sort of national organisation ordinarily required to win a presidential election. As late as June, for instance, Trump has no state director in the must-win state of Ohio. Evidently, he continues to believe that he can triumph in this election with his smart phone, the free airtime he gets from television interviews, his personal magnetism, and a small team, centred largely on family members, operating out of Trump Tower. His shake-up this week has sidelined advisers, like Paul Manafort, who were trying to normalise his candidacy and to bring more message discipline to his freewheeling campaign. Again, it underscores how Trump has flunked the transition from being the figurehead of his highly personalised insurgent campaign to his new role as the standard-bearer of the Republican Party. This summer has also produced the kind of pivotal moment that can decide elections. In 1960, it was Nixon sweating profusely during his first televised debate with Kennedy. In 1988, it was Michael Dukakis in a tank. In 2012, it was the release of the film showing Mitt Romney talking about the ""47%."" In 2016, it appears to have been the moment on the final night of the Democratic convention, when Khizr Khan stood with his wife, Ghazala, waving a pocket-sized copy of the US Constitution accusingly at Donald Trump, and declaring: ""You have sacrificed nothing and no one."" Up until then, many of Donald Trump's nativist attacks on Mexicans and Muslims have, to many voters I suspect, seemed rather abstract. The Khans gave them a face, a backstory and a human dimension: two Gold Star parents and their son, Captain Humayan Khan, a decorated war hero who loved to read books about Thomas Jefferson. Travelling through the American south last week, I repeatedly came across Republican-leaning voters who thought that this time, finally, Trump had gone too far - that he had crossed a behavioural threshold, that his candidacy had become too crazed. For all that, the most common refrain I heard was that voters are deeply unhappy with the choice before them, which is why this race is not yet over. Dismay at Donald Trump has not grown into fervour for Hillary Clinton, and never will. That Khan moment highlighted another difference between this summer and last. Back then, controversy generated attention and attention generated support. For Donald Trump, that calculus that worked for him in the Republican primaries no longer seems to work.","Last summer, Donald Trump could do no wrong. What a difference a year makes."
"That El Nino played havoc with world weather systems and was blamed for several extreme weather events. The current El Nino has been linked to several floods and unusually warm conditions in the northern hemisphere. The phenomenon sees warm waters of the central Pacific expand eastwards towards North and South America. El Nino is a naturally occurring weather episode which happens every two to seven years. It usually peaks late in the calendar year, although the effects can persist well into the following spring and last up to 12 months. Nasa says the current El Nino ""shows no signs of waning"", based on the latest satellite image of the Pacific Ocean. It bears ""a striking resemblance"" to one from December 1997, the agency says, ""the signature of a big and powerful El Nino"". Strongest El Nino since 1950 on the way Matt McGrath: 'High impacts' from globally stronger El Nino Worries over humanitarian impact This year's El Nino has been linked to the worst floods seen in 50 years in Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The floods there have forced more than 150,000 people from their homes - more than 100,000 of them in the Paraguayan capital alone. In the US, 13 people have died in the US state of Missouri as a result of flooded rivers after tornadoes and storms hit the region. A five-mile (8km) section of the Mississippi River near St Louis was closed to vessels as a result of the ""hazardous conditions"" that have been caused. El Nino has also been cited as a factor in the floods that have hit northern parts of the UK, forcing thousands from their homes and leaving thousands more without power. Storm Frank, which is expected to bring fresh rain and flooding to the UK this week, is part of a weather system causing unusually high temperatures in the Arctic. One weather buoy near the North Pole has measured a temperature above freezing - almost unheard of at this time of year, when the normal figure is about -25C (-13F). Astonishing spike at North Pole: BBC science editor David Shukman One of the most bizarre side-effects of the current turbulence in the global weather is that even at the roof of the world, at what is meant to be the coldest time of the year in the northern hemisphere, the North Pole itself is unusually warm. There are no instruments there at the moment to provide exact readings but US weather buoys, drifting with the ice slightly to the south, have recorded the extraordinary fact of temperatures nudging just above zero. And the Norwegian weather service estimates temperatures there to be around -2C. Either way, that is astonishingly warm given the average temperature for the time of year, which is around -25C. The spike in warmth will not last long but may conceivably act as a brake on the usual process of the growth of winter ice in the Arctic. And it certainly serves as a reminder of the power and reach of Storm Frank, which is currently battering the UK, as the swirl of winds around it has pushed warm air northwards. Higher temperatures than the seasonal average have been noted in many parts of Europe and the US. Average temperatures on Christmas Day in France were the second highest on record, just below those of 1997. The mild weather has forced farmers to harvest crops such as salad, strawberries and asparagus early, with reports of large amounts of produce going to waste. Desperation in one French ski resort at the lack of snow led to 100 tons of snow being airlifted in by helicopter. In Italy, experts say the unusually calm and dry weather has exacerbated pollution over the cities of Milan and Rome. By contrast, in Mexico El Nino is being blamed for freezing temperatures in the north of the country, with snow seen in parts of the Sonoran desert for the first time in 33 years. Three deaths have been blamed on the cold in Sonora state. 'Turning up heat further' The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has stressed that El Nino is not the only factor driving global climate patterns but said the implications of the weather systems in a warmer world are uncertain. ""This naturally occurring El Nino event and human-induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced, "" WMO secretary general Michael Jarraud said last month. ""Even before the onset of El Nino, global average surface temperatures had reached new records. El Nino is turning up the heat even further,"" he said.","The US space agency Nasa has warned that the effects of the current El Nino weather phenomenon could be as bad as those of 1998, the strongest on record."
"The August survey will determine the number of citizens who do not identify as either male or female. Intersex people in Kenya often face violence and discrimination. There are thought to be more than 700,000 of them out of a general population of 49 million. ""Getting information about intersex people in the census will help people understand the challenges we go through,"" Ryan Muiruri, founder of the Intersex Persons Society of Kenya (IPSK), said he welcomed the government's decision. ""Being included in the census is a big achievement for us,"" he told the BBC. South Africa was the first African country to explicitly include intersex people in anti-discrimination law. What is the background? In 2009, a woman in Kenya went to court after doctors wrote a question mark instead of a gender on her child's birth papers. He wanted three things: identity documents for her child to be able to attend school, a law preventing surgery on intersex children unless it is medically necessary, and proper information and psychological support for parents. In a landmark ruling in 2014, the High Court ordered the government to issue a birth certificate to the five-year-old child. In addition, it ordered the attorney general to create a task force that would look at ways of providing better support for intersex children. That task force handed its recommendations to the Attorney General in April. They include delaying surgery until children can choose for themselves and a robust survey on numbers. It also recommended that an I-marker, an intersex identifier, be used in public documentation. Intersex You may also be interested in: 'They wanted to know if I squat or stand' Ryan Muiruri, IPSK founder, speaking to BBC I was born an intersex but assigned a female identity and named Ruth. My parents didn't accept me and went to the witchdoctor because they wanted to correct what most people saw as a curse. People would tease my mum about my identity, and I would often see her crying. I knew I was different when I was five. One day when I was playing with other children, one of them called me a girl and another said: ""Who told you Ruth is a girl."" They went ahead to undress me. In school, every time I went to the toilet people would follow me to see if I stand or squat. It was so embarrassing and extremely uncomfortable. One thing that hurt me the most is being called ""a curse"" by a village elder and being blamed for a drought that had hit our region. I tried to take my life five times because I felt alone and rejected. One day I was in a bank to do a transaction, the teller called the police instead accusing me of impersonation. I tried to explain my situation to them but they didn't understand. It's only after I undressed that they believed me and allowed me to do the transaction. I started the Intersex Persons Society of Kenya to help people like me. Being included in the national population census is a big achievement for us. An intersex timeline","Kenya will become the first country in Africa to collect data on intersex people in its national population census, in a major victory for rights activists."
"Mr Obama said on his Twitter feed: ""Neil Armstrong was a hero not just of his time, but of all time."" Hundreds of millions watched Armstrong land on the Moon on 20 July 1969 and describe it as: ""One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."" The line became one of the most famous quotes of the 20th Century. Armstrong's family confirmed his death in a statement on Saturday, saying he had died from complications after surgery to relieve four blocked coronary arteries. The family statement praised him as a ""reluctant American hero"" and urged his fans to honour his example of ""service, accomplishment and modesty"". ""The next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink,"" the family said. Mr Obama thanked Armstrong for showing the world ""the power of one small step"". 'Nerdy engineer' Last November he received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest US civilian award. Many of Armstrong's colleagues and friends paid tribute to him as a modest, private man who never sought the limelight. Michael Collins, a pilot on the Apollo 11 Moon mission, said: ""He was the best, and I will miss him terribly."" Armstrong famously refused most public appearances and interviews. In a rare interview with Australian TV this year, he reflected on a moment during his three hours on the Moon when he stopped to commemorate US astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who had died in action. ""It was special and memorable, but it was only instantaneous because there was work to do,"" he said. More than 500 million TV viewers around the world watched its touchdown on the lunar surface. Armstrong and fellow astronaut Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin collected samples, conducted experiments and took photographs during their moonwalk. Mr Aldrin told the BBC he would remember his colleague as a ""very capable commander and leader of a world achievement"". ""We're missing a great spokesman and leader in the space programme,"" he said. Apollo 11 was Armstrong's last space mission. In 1971, he left the US space agency Nasa to teach aerospace engineering. Born in 1930 and raised in Ohio, Armstrong took his first flight aged six with his father and formed a lifelong passion for flying. He flew Navy fighter jets during the Korean War in the 1950s, and joined the US space programme in 1962. Correspondents say Armstrong remained modest and never allowed himself to be caught up in the glamour of space exploration. ""I am, and ever will be, a white-socks, pocket-protector, nerdy engineer,"" he said in February 2000 in a rare public appearance. Nasa chief Charles Bolden paid tribute to him as ""one of America's great explorers"". ""As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own.""","US President Barack Obama has led tributes to astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon, who died on Saturday at the age of 82."
"Fr Brian Brady teamed up with a shop in Clonmany, County Donegal, to provide holy ashes in sauce containers. Covid-19 restrictions in the country mean all church services must be conducted online. He told BBC News NI that he has been overwhelmed by the response. All 600 portions of ashes have been taken away. ""It's a new experience formed to have people wanting to talk to me,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""There's been a lot of attention and people want more ashes but can't get them."" The priest said it was ""a nice feeling"" that this initiative had meant something to people. ""A lot of our parishioners would come every year for their ashes and it's so important that we honour those traditions - even at these most difficult times,"" he said. ""We really did have to stretch the old imagination on this one though."" 'Huge community spirit' More than 600 containers have already been distributed for the holy day. The containers are limited to one per household and they also include a prayer service for use in the home prepared by Fr Brady. Instructions about how to apply ashes are on the sheet. ""The advice is to moisten them, but to be careful not to moisten too much as they'll run down your forehead and nose as has happened to many a poor soul in the past,"" Fr Brady said. Staff at the local Centra have been helping make up the containers, which are usually for sauces. They have been using burnt palms from Palm Sunday which have been blessed and left out for collection at the three churches in the parish. What is Ash Wednesday? Ash Wednesday marks the first day of Lent, a season of reflection and preparation before Easter. Catholics traditionally attend a Mass at which their foreheads are marked with ash in the shape of a cross. By observing the 40 days of Lent, Christians replicate Jesus Christ's sacrifice and withdrawal into the desert for 40 days. The period of reflection is marked by fasting, both from food and festivities. Shop owner Joe Joyce said he could not believe how popular the takeaway ashes have been, and he's also blown away by the amount of media attention they were getting. Staff have been working on more containers to help meet the demand, he told BBC News NI. ""There is a huge community spirit here in Clonmany, and this is just another thing the village has got behind during these tough times,"" he said. ""Through our local community group, Clonmany Together, people have helped deliver groceries, they've delivered medicines, they've done online bingo and now this. ""It's just another simple gesture that people here wanted to do for others."" Meanwhile Fr Brady confesses that he got ""a bit of ribbing from some of his priest friends about takeaway ashes"". ""But I would hope if priests thought it was worthwhile, they would go with it,"" he said. The bishop too is on side. ""He seems to be pleased that an effort has been made to enable this important tradition to continue,"" said Fr Brady. The Clonmany parish includes St Mary's in Clonmany, St Michael's in Urris and the Oratory of the Assumption, Ballyliffin.","A priest in the Republic of Ireland has made ""takeaway ashes"" available for parishioners to administer at home on Ash Wednesday."
"Medellin, once known for being the stronghold of the Medellin drugs cartel, beat Tel Aviv and New York. The institute said Medellin had excelled in increasing the mobility of citizens living in poor communities. The city has an efficient metro and cable car system, which allows people to access the city centre easily. The Urban Land Institute compiled a list of 200 cities based on eight criteria ranging from culture and liveability to education and infrastructure. People were then asked to vote online for their top candidates. 'Reason for joy' The Urban Land Institute said Medellin had seen one of the most remarkable urban turnarounds in modern history. It praised its civic spaces, libraries, and art galleries, as well as its infrastructure which includes a giant escalator and a cable car allowing the residents of the poor neighbourhoods on Medellin's steep hillside to easily commute to the city centre, in the valley. Medellin's mayor Anibal Gaviria said the award was ""a reason for joy on the part of every one of the 2.5 million inhabitants of our city."" He also commended former mayor Sergio Fajardo for launching many of the projects which were praised in the competition. However, Medellin has not been able to cast off its violent past entirely. In December, the bodies of nine people were found at a luxury home on the outskirts of the city. Police believe they fell victim to a settling of scores within a powerful Medellin-based criminal gang, many of whose members had originally worked for the Medellin drugs cartel.","Medellin, in Colombia, has been named the world's most innovative city in a competition organised by the non-profit Urban Land Institute."
"The territory has seen rapid spread following the first confirmed community case on 6 November, in the hamlet of Sanikiluaq. There are now 60 confirmed cases across four communities - Sanikiluaq, Rankin Inlet, Whale Cove and Arviat. This comes as cases continue to rise in many parts of Canada. There have now been over 302,192 cases of Covid-19 in Canada, and over 11,027 deaths. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is urging people to adhere to public health measures as various regions clamp down due to outbreaks. On Tuesday, the country's chief public health officer, Dr Theresa Tam, warned of ""very troubling developments"" in the pandemic, including spread in hospitals, care homes and indigenous communities, where populations are especially vulnerable. In Nunavut, the numbers shot up in the sparsely populated northern territory, which has about 35,000 residents. The spread sparked enough concern that, as of Wednesday, gatherings will be restricted and non-essential businesses, schools and recreation facilities will be closed territory-wide for at least two weeks. ""We know that we have very vulnerable Nunavummiut here, we have lots of overcrowding and lots of underlying health issues,"" Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq told CTV news channel on Tuesday morning. The territory's chief public health officer, Dr Michael Patterson, said that the last week ""has shown us just how quickly Covid-19 spreads"". The federal government is sending a three-month supply of personal protective equipment to Nunavut as officials there work to contain the spread. What is the situation in the rest of Canada? Canada's most populous provinces, Quebec and Ontario, have had the highest number of cases - 125,072 and 95,496 confirmed infections, respectively. Ontario has had over 1,000 new cases a day for almost two weeks straight, including 1,249 on Tuesday, and various restrictions have been brought back in recent weeks in parts of the province, including the city of Toronto. Cases are rising quickly in Manitoba, which last week closed non-essential businesses and services, and limited social gatherings amid a sharp spike and concerns hospitals were nearing capacity. The province is reporting 270 new cases and a seven additional deaths. British Columbia saw a record number of new cases over the weekend, adding almost 2,000 new cases to its total, and Alberta is seeing a surge in new cases, with targeted measures brought into effect in specific communities. Atlantic Canada has fared better, with the four east coast provinces keeping a second wave of coronavirus largely at bay. After months of restrictions, the Atlantic provinces formed their own ""travel bubble"" in July, allowing free travel between themselves without mandatory quarantine. There are currently 65 active cases across the entire region. But officials there remain cautious due to the rise in cases in other parts of Canada. While there were no new cases of coronavirus to report on Tuesday in the small island province of Prince Edward Island, health officials still announced that new indoor mandatory mask measures would be in place by late week. ""This isn't about the cases here, this is about the turbulence we're seeing across the country,"" provincial premier Dennis King said on Tuesday.","After months of no Covid-19 cases in its communities, the Canadian territory of Nunavut is entering a two-week coronavirus lockdown."
"Or their well-wishing uncles. Or caring aunts. Or any one of the newly digital Indians who gleefully realise that family members, once kept out of reach by distance, are contactable at the touch of a button. Google identified the issue while investigating why one in three smartphone users in India runs out of space every day. The company told the Wall Street Journal it had now introduced an app to help users solve the problem. But what is behind the Good Morning message phenomenon? BBC Marathi editor in Delhi, Ashish Dikshit, gets a lot of WhatsApp messages from his mum and other digital converts in his family. He explains what's behind it all. ""You talk to anyone in our office - it's the same story,"" he says. ""I get roughly 15 or 20 Good Morning messages every morning. They're mostly from family members. ""But some of the messages are from extremely random people, like someone I met two years ago."" Good Morning messages - usually texts or pictures - often have flowers and animals on them, and some are animated GIFs. ""The older people in my family are addicted to WhatsApp - they're constantly using it. My mum starts WhatsApp-ing in the morning, and because she is forwarding hundreds of messages every day, she receives hundreds back."" ""Mum broadcasts messages to all her contacts,"" Ashish explains and says this behaviour is common for people of his mother's generation, born in the 1960s. Ashish says the messages clog his phone - but the real problem is his mum's smartphone. She receives and sends daily hundreds of videos, pictures and gifs that range from a greeting to beauty advice - but the size of the files causes the phone to fill up and crash. You might also like: He says people of her generation have often never seen or used computers, and their first computer is a smartphone. ""It's a very sudden change in India - cheap phones and cheap data. WhatsApp doesn't use much data so in my mum's mind, she's sending free messages - it's a good deal for her. She's very happy."" Like all of us, Ashish's lax attention to his phone can get him into trouble. ""Mum gets upset when she sees I haven't read the forwards. She calls me up and asks if I've seen them. She feels sad, but I have to tell her I don't have time to read hundreds of messages,"" he explains. He thinks that families living apart in different cities in India contributes to the high use of WhatsApp for communication. ""It's [a] phenomenon - an urge to forward everything. They are old and they want to talk to people and their families. ""Many have issues now with mobility. They can't travel easily to visit family. The internet has given them a way to keep in touch,"" he says. ""It's also their way of helping others - for example, sending a message about how to take care of winter skin."" Despite receiving hundreds of messages a day, many of which cannot be verified, Ashish says he has never asked his mum to stop. ""I don't want to suppress her form of expression. It's an extension of her personality. She worked before she retired and she's a very sociable person. ""I don't get to spend enough time with her so I think that by messaging me, she's spending time with me."" By Georgina Rannard, UGC & Social News","When it emerged this week that the culprit behind India's slowing internet is the daily flow of millions of Good Morning text messages, many Indians immediately thought of their mothers."
"By Ritu PrasadBBC News, Washington In an interview, Mr Trump referred to career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, not by name, but as ""the woman"". Ms Yovanovitch, who Mr Trump recalled from her post in May, testified in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry on 15 November. She told lawmakers she was removed in a smear campaign by those with ""questionable intentions"". Justifying his decision to oust her, the president told Fox & Friends last Friday he heard ""bad things"" about ""the ambassador, the woman"". ""This was not an angel, this woman, okay? And there were a lot of things that she did that I didn't like."" Mr Trump added that his staff felt they had to be kind because ""she's a woman - we have to be nice."" Professor Marianne LaFrance, a psychologist at Yale University, says this remark is a prime example of gendered language. ""That referencing says she's not an individual, she's not a professional, she's first and foremost a woman,"" Prof LaFrance says. ""One of the things that's interesting about women and language is that women are 'marked'."" Men, she notes, are not usually referred to as a ""male person"". ""But we find it often easy and useful to describe a person first and foremost as a woman. Not a politician - she's a woman politician. You don't often say he's a male politician."" And once language is used to ""mark"" someone, it ""taps into a whole universe of stereotypes"" that are typically unconscious. ""So in saying a female politician - before you've said anything else about her policies, her credentials, her professional standing - you've said a lot."" A controversial track record Even before he became president, Mr Trump had a history of controversial comments about women. His comments in a 2005 Access Hollywood tape about grabbing women ""by the pussy"" are perhaps the most notorious, and made headlines in 2016. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutger's University, says these latest remarks are part of a pattern. ""The kind of things that he said about Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina, Elizabeth Warren, Heidi Cruz - the list goes on - he talks about women, any prominent, powerful woman, in the most demeaning of ways, trivialising them."" Even women backing Mr Trump have not been immune to subtly gendered critiques. On Friday, Mr Trump told Fox & Friends his adviser Kellyanne Conway was great, but ""must have done some number"" on her husband, George, who is a Trump critic. ""She must have done some bad things to him because that guy's crazy,"" the president said. Ms Walsh also notes the women closest to Mr Trump ""have the appearance of a kind of hyper-feminised version of women"". Ivanka Trump, for example, is a successful businesswoman, but still fits within the typical image of a woman ""on the arm of powerful men"". Some of Trump's past comments about women: From a psychology perspective, Prof LaFrance says when comments go into the realm of insult, they can be insidiously harmful. A recent study looking at how women are affected by overhearing sexism found that even when a comment was not directed at the listener, it had a negative impact on a woman's self-esteem, measured by how well she evaluated her own performance and abilities following the incident, Prof LaFrance explains. ""It sets up an atmosphere in which all women are targeted, not just the one person who was a target [of the sexist comment] - that's what's particularly damaging."" With Mr Trump specifically, Prof LaFrance says when he criticises female opponents, he often reduces them to a sexual object or someone unworthy of respect or attention. ""Comments about a woman not being strong, a notion that she's frail or weak - those appear to be much milder in comparison to talking about her pussy, but they have as damaging, if not more damaging effects on women,"" Prof LaFrance says, as it taps into existing notions that women are perceived as less-than men. Trump - champion of women? Despite the controversial ways he describes women - and the distinctly male look of his cabinet - it would be unfair to say that Mr Trump excludes powerful women from his inner circle. In addition to Ivanka, who is a White House adviser, the highest profile members of the administration defending the president on a daily basis are Ms Conway and press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Ms Grisham's predecessor too, was a woman - Sarah Huckabee Sanders. When challenged on his attitude to women, Mr Trump has in the past pointed to his record in recruiting and promoting women in his companies. ""I love women,"" he proclaims. His 2020 campaign is led by Brad Parscale, but according to Politico, the highest levels of the campaign team include over a dozen women as senior advisers and directors. The BBC reached out to Women For Trump, one of the biggest pro-Trump women's political groups, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. The women who love Trump Analysis by Tara McKelvey ""I understand some of his quips are not popular,"" says Virginia Derby Jordan, a lawyer who lives in Orange County, Virginia. But she says she doesn't mind. She and other conservative women in Virginia, Pennsylvania and other states say there are more important issues than the president's remarks. They applaud the way he has helped bring down unemployment among women and appreciates how he has fought against abortion through the appointment of conservative judges. In addition, Jordan and other Republicans like the way he has hired women such as Kellyanne Conway, a counsellor to the president, for high-profile roles: ""He has put women in very important places,"" Jordan says. Jordan attests to the fact that despite the controversial way the president talks about women, many of them still adore him and will vote for him again in 2020. Doesn't he nickname men too? If the president's preferred nicknames for women are nasty, crazy, and low-IQ, his go-tos for men are in a similar vein. ""It's always about demeaning men in order to make them less tough, less strong, in many ways, less masculine,"" says Ms Walsh. ""He's also pumping himself up as the uber-masculine figure at the expense of the men who are challenging him in any way."" One of his favourites to level at male opponents is ""little"" - Little Marco Rubio, Little Michael Bloomberg, Little Adam Schiff, Little Rocket Man. Prof LaFrance notes: ""Once you've referred to a person's size or standing as small or little, then you're trafficking in the realm of gender terminology."" For Ms Walsh, though Mr Trump does not discriminate in criticising men and women who oppose him, the attacks on women are more dangerous. She says the instance where Mr Trump singled out four freshmen Democratic congresswomen of colour and told them to ""go home"" was particularly ""threatening"". ""We know women are often targeted on the political front, threatened certainly online, and singling them out and using very loaded language about those four women was one of the most egregious things."" How might this play out in 2020? An April Pew Research Center study found a stark gender divide for Mr Trump's approval ratings. Just under half of men said they approved of how Mr Trump was handling the presidency, compared to 32% of women. Pew analysis of his first two years in office found his average approval rating to be 44% among men and 31% among women - the widest gap between genders since the George H W Bush presidency. And while Mr Trump found success with white women voters in 2016, he may find it more difficult to win them this time around, according to recent polling. Ms Walsh says Mr Trump could see real challenges in winning over white, college educated, suburban women who are typically Republicans ""in part because of this language, this behaviour and the way he treats women"". ""The gendered language is already out there,"" says Ms Walsh. ""I think that it is likely on the Democratic side, that one way or another, there will be a woman on the ticket [for president or vice-president]. And I'm sure that woman will come under attack...I think we're in for more of the same.""","With a number of women running to take on President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, the president's language about his opponents will undoubtedly be a recurring issue. But is there really a gender difference to his attacks?"
"Under the bill, only the government would be allowed to sell marijuana to adults registered on a database. Defence Minister Eleuterio Fernandez Huidobro said this was part of a plan to remove profits from drug dealers and divert users from harder drugs. He said that the recent increase in murder rates was a clear symptom of a rise in drug trafficking crimes. Ground-breaking bill ""We believe that the prohibition of certain drugs is creating more problems for society than the drugs themselves... with disastrous consequences,"" Mr Fernandez Huidobro said, presenting the bill. ""Homicides related to settling scores have increased, and that's a clear sign that certain phenomena are appearing in Uruguay that didn't exist before,"" he said. The authorities blame the rise in crime in Uruguay on hard drugs, specifically crack cocaine. The new bill envisages that some shops would be allowed to sell marijuana cigarettes at a price fixed by the authorities. The government also wants to create a user database to supervise consumption. BBC regional correspondent Vladimir Hernandez says the move is seen as groundbreaking in South America. Several Central American leaders - including the presidents of Guatemala and Costa Rica - have spoken of the need to consider decriminalising some drugs in an attempt to undermine cartels. In Uruguay alone, the illegal marijuana market is estimated to be worth about $75m (£48m) a year. But the new bill has already proved controversial, and the debate in Congress could take several months, our correspondent says.",Uruguay has unveiled a plan to allow state-controlled sales of marijuana to fight a rise in drug-related crime.

"Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin said the Republic of Ireland could not ""risk moving backward"". The next phase would also have allowed gatherings of up to 500 people outdoors and 50 indoors. Mr Martin said the decision would be reviewed again in three weeks time. It is the second deferral of Phase 4 after the Irish cabinet voted to delay it in July amid concerns about the spread of the virus. The current rules on gatherings allow for a maximum of 200 people to meet outdoors and 50 indoors. On Tuesday, the cabinet also made changes to the green list for travel and announced face coverings will be mandatory in shops and shopping centres from Monday 10 August. Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar, San Marino and Monaco have been removed from the list of countries from which travellers would not have to self-quarantine for 14 days. 'Make or break' The Vintners' Federation of Ireland had described Tuesday as a ""make or break day"" for the hospitality industry. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that the federation, which represents 3,500 pubs outside Dublin, said publicans and their families were under ""huge strain"" In Northern Ireland, ""wet pubs"" - or pubs that do not serve food - have been given an indicative date to reopen from Monday 10 August, but this has yet to be signed off by the Stormont Executive. Speaking after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the taoiseach said he was ""very sorry"" for the ""body blow"" the decision will have on some sectors. Mr Martin said the reopening of schools and resuming other health services was essential and appealed for people to have patience to suppress the virus. On Tuesday, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported 45 new cases of Covid-19 and no further deaths. There have been 1,763 deaths related to coronavirus in the country, with a total of 26,253 confirmed cases. In Northern Ireland, the total number of positive cases now stands at 5,996, while the Department of Health's death toll remains at at 556.","The Irish government has decided not to move to Phase 4 of its Covid-19 recovery plan, meaning pubs and hotel bars remain closed."
"Born in Toronto in 1950 and brought up in a fishing village in New Brunswick, he was just nine years old when - according to the Sea Shepherd website - ""trappers killed one of his beaver friends"". Inspired, he set about confiscating and destroying leg-hold traps, and disrupting deer hunts. Mr Watson says he was one of the founding members of Greenpeace in 1971. The environmental campaign group disputes he was a founder, but concedes he was ""an influential early member"" who took part in many of its high-profile campaigns against whaling and nuclear testing. Confrontational methods But he left Greenpeace in 1977 because his confrontational methods - he proposed ramming illegal whalers - ran against the group's policy of non-violence. He set up the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, bought a new ship, and took to the seas again. In the past 35 years he has had a series of violent confrontations with seal hunters, illegal whalers and various navies during which he has been shot at, chased and arrested. In May 2012 he was arrested in Germany. The arrest warrant relates to a clash in Guatemalan waters and subsequently in Costa Rica in 2002, where Sea Shepherd was attempting to combat illegal shark finning - which involves sharks being killed solely for their fins, the only edible part of the fish. Mr Watson has had numerous brushes with the law since. In July 2011 his vessel, the Steve Irwin, was briefly impounded in the Shetland Islands after a Maltese fishing company sued him for $1.4m (£850,000) over his disruption of their blue fin tuna catch. Sea Shepherd was later involved in an action against the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean. That culminated in a warning from Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard that future such protests would result in activists being ""charged and convicted"".","Paul Watson, the founder of US-based anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd, was introduced to the world of environmental activism at an early age."
"Half of the under spend will stay with the departments to fund other projects in 2015, the rest will go into a central emergency fund. Senator Alan Maclean said that money will help departments manage further budget cuts in 2015. In March, he predicted the budget deficit could be up to £100m. The problem arose through a combination of overestimated income from taxation and rising public spending costs. ""Over the coming year all States Departments are going to have to tackle the challenge of delivering 2% saving across their budgets and doing so in a way that maintains their provision at a high level,"" Senator Maclean said. ""The under spends from 2014 will give departments improved flexibility in delivering key services."" The £13m staying within departments will be used to fund a number of services that may have been cut otherwise. The money also includes about £1m for studies and investment in ways to save money in the future. Senator Maclean said: ""Sometimes you need to invest money to save money. You bring in some initial cost but in the longer term the service is delivered much cheaper."" But Deputy Sam Mezec, chairman of Reform Jersey, said this was a side effect of a broken political system. ""It seems that every day we are getting a new piece of information, a new report that shows we are in a worse position we thought we were. We need to know where it is going to stop,"" he said. ""At the election we were never told things were bad at all, let alone how bad they are. ""We don't have a decent overlook of our financial position at all. It is the height of irony that we are paying people to find ways to save money.""","Jersey faces a significant budget deficit despite departments spending £26m under their allocated budget in 2014, the treasury minister has said."
"Businessman Peter Casey came second with 23.1%, while none of the other four candidates polled more than 10%. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was ""disappointed"", but felt it was wrong for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to ""sit on the sidelines"" in the election. Voters also supported the proposal to remove blasphemy as an offence from the Constitution, with 64.85% voting yes. Mr Higgins, the first incumbent in 50 years to face a challenge in his bid for a second term, won with 822,566 votes. Londonderry businessman Peter Casey took significantly more votes than the final opinion polls of the campaign had predicted. His final tally was 342,727. Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ni Riada got 93,987 votes - 6.4% of the total votes polled. ""I am not sorry that we had an election - I think it was wrong for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to sit on the sidelines,"" Ms McDonald told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. ""We decided to challenge in the election - the other parties didn't."" She added: ""I think my leadership would have rightly been called into question if I fell in line with Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar. ""Of course I'm disappointed. I would have liked a better showing for Liadh [Ni Riada]but that was not to be. ""You learn from every contest. You learn from every encounter that you have with the electorate and we'll certainly learn from this."" Irish Presidential Election result Valid votes cast: 1,473,900 The result was confirmed at a declaration at Dublin Castle on Saturday evening. Speaking after his win, Mr Higgins said he accepted his mandate with ""humility, determination and excitement"". ""People are interested in ideas that are sincere and constructive,"" he said. ""For words matter, words can hurt, words can heal, words can empower, words can divide. ""And the words and ideas I have used in this campaign reflect a vision for Ireland based on four strands. ""Equal and together, strong sustainable communities, sharing history - shaping the future and Ireland's voice matters."" Low turnout Taking to the podium after Mr Higgins, second-placed Mr Casey said the last time he had stood in an election to the Irish Senate he got just 14 votes. ""Somebody worked it out there - it's about 23,000 per cent improvement,"" he joked. Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ni Riada said she hoped it was the last Irish presidential election in which people in Northern Ireland could not vote. Turnout was reported to be low in many areas of the country. More than 3.2 million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the election and referendum. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar congratulated Mr Higgins on his predicted win on Saturday morning. The president is Ireland's ""first citizen"", but has limited power - the role is mainly symbolic and he or she cannot get involved in daily politics. Voters received two ballot papers at polling stations on Friday. They were given a white ballot paper for the presidential election and a green ballot paper for the referendum on blasphemy. Many were unaware there was such an offence until a member of the public referred controversial remarks made by the actor and writer Stephen Fry on an RTÉ programme to gardai (Irish police). The investigation was dropped last year, reportedly because officers could not find anyone who was offended.",Michael D Higgins has been re-elected as Irish president after receiving 56% of the country's election vote.
"A fire followed the blast which happened around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) at the Baumgarten site, just east of the capital Vienna, near the Slovak border. On Twitter, Austrian police said the situation was under control and a technical fault had caused the blast. The flow of Russian gas to Europe has dropped, triggering price hikes. Italy declared a state of emergency. Baumgarten is a key hub for imported Russian gas, which is sent on to a number of European countries. The facility receives about 40bn cubic metres of gas per year. ""The installation has been brought under control and operations have been suspended there,"" said Armin Teichert, spokesman for the operator, Austria's Gas Connect service. Police have cordoned off the area. Some victims suffering burns have been airlifted out by helicopter, Austrian ORF news reports. One unconfirmed report spoke of 60 hurt. ""I heard a huge explosion and thought at first it was a plane crash,"" photographer Thomas Hulik, who lives in a nearby village in Slovakia, told AFP news agency. ""Then I saw an immense ball of flame."" Gas Connect said the incident should have no effect on gas deliveries to Austria but those to Italy and Croatia might be reduced. Meanwhile, Russia's Gazprom Export company said it was working to redirect gas flows. It said it was ""doing everything possible to secure uninterrupted gas supplies"" to customers in the region. Ukraine'S Ukrtransgaz firm said that ""due to the emergency situation in the EU there will be a temporary fall in the volume of natural gas transit across Ukraine in the Slovak direction"". Ukraine is a major transporter of Russian gas into the EU. Spot prices rose sharply across Europe after the incident.","A big blast has rocked a major natural gas hub in Austria, killing one person and injuring at least 18, police say."
"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter Under the headline ""Secret Alliance: Israel Carries Out Airstrikes in Egypt, With Cairo's O.K."" its correspondent, David D. Kirkpatrick provided details of a remarkable and highly secret military relationship. ""For more than two years,"" he wrote, ""unmarked Israeli drones, helicopters and jets have carried out a covert air campaign, conducting more than 100 airstrikes inside Egypt, frequently more than once a week — and all with the approval of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi."" While Egypt has had a peace deal with Israel since 1979, it is widely characterised as a ""cold peace"". Even now any collaboration - let alone sanctioned air strikes - is rarely acknowledged. The essence of the story was that the Egyptian military which had long been struggling to cope with an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai, had turned to Israel for assistance. The relationship had benefits for both parties. ""For Cairo,"" he noted, ""the Israeli intervention has helped the Egyptian military regain its footing in its nearly five-year battle against the militants. ""For Israel, the strikes have bolstered the security of its borders and the stability of its neighbour."" The article looked to be based entirely upon Israeli or western sources. When the article was published it provoked consternation amongst Egyptian media commentators who branded it ""unprofessional journalism"" and ""fake news"". Egypt's military spokesman insisted that it was only the Egyptian law enforcement forces that were confronting the militants. Such military cooperation, if true, would be a highly sensitive matter for the Egyptian authorities. But amid a litany of reports of air strikes - both by drones and manned aircraft - over several months, I certainly wondered at times just who might be carrying them out. The story fits into the pattern of a wider shift in the region - the broad lines of which are certainly true - but its extent and its likely consequences remain far from clear. An anti-Iran alliance? The rise of Iran and its growing regional role - extending from the Gulf to the Mediterranean is alarming countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. Circumstances then have pushed some of the moderate Sunni Arab states ever closer towards Israel. They share concerns about both Iran's regional role and its nuclear ambitions, and the perceived unwillingness of Washington in recent years to confront Tehran. Diplomatic signals and briefings lead one to believe that there is genuine substance in this rapprochement. There have also been subtle and some not-so-subtle signs. Most recently, Dr Mohammed Al Issa, secretary general of the Saudi-based Muslim World League, wrote a fascinating ""open"" letter to the director of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington where he both expressed his sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust during World War Two and condemned those who would say that the Holocaust never happened. This from a very senior religious leader in a region that has, to be blunt, been at the forefront of Holocaust denial for decades, was a remarkable statement. Can Israel have its cake and eat it? From the Arab side one has to piece together incidents like this to give a sense of the changes that are going on beneath the surface. The Israelis - perhaps some might say ill-advisedly - are much more forthright. Both in private briefings and in public they are eager to play up their improving ties with the moderate Sunni states. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, put it this way in a presentation at London think tank Chatham House last November. Speaking of developments in the region he said that ""the bad news is that, in the battle between the medievalists and the modernists, the medievalists are moving forward, specifically with Iran"". But the good news, he went on, ""is that the other guys are getting together with Israel as never before. And there is something that I wouldn't have expected in my lifetime, but we're working very hard to establish, and that is an effective alliance between Israel and the moderate Sunni states to counter the aggression of Iran, to roll it back as far as possible."" And he strove to underline the point, noting that ""as you move towards the Persian Gulf, or as they call it, the Arab Gulf, you will find that attitudes to Israel are mellowing considerably"". He continued: ""They're still very hardened, you know, in the Palestinians, in our immediate vicinity, but they sort of mellow out. "" Mr Netanyahu's mention of the Palestinians is an element that should bring this debate down to earth. True, even when US President Donald Trump announced his intention to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, there was only a muted reaction amongst Sunni Arab leaders. But attitudes in wider Arab society, among intellectuals and the populace at large, do not tend to reflect this ""elite softening"" towards Israel. Far from it. There is a paradox here that many analysts believe that this is a moment of opportunity to try to push forward the Israel-Palestinian peace process and to take advantage of the newfound co-operative mood between Israel and the so-called moderate Arabs. But the Sunni Arab states still grate at some of the policies of Mr Netanyahu's government, even as they seek wider consensus on the mutual security threats they both face. And there are those in Israel who despair at what they see as a wasted opportunity to at the very least test out what might be possible. The Netanyahu government seems to be signalling that it can have its cake and eat it - in other words it can make no progress on the Palestinian front while still improving its relationship with the moderate Arab states.",Over the weekend the New York Times carried a fascinating scoop.
"Flight UA839, carrying 194 people, had been on a 15-hour flight to the city from Los Angeles. Police said they activated a ""full emergency response"" shortly before the jet landed at 06:36 local time on Thursday (20:36 Wednesday GMT). United Airlines called it a mechanical issue and said all on board were safe. ""The aircraft taxied to the gate and all customers disembarked normally,"" the airline said in a statement. The pilot of the 787-900 Dreamliner had earlier issued a mayday call due to low fuel levels, said Airservices Australia, the nation's aviation navigation authority. New South Wales police said the incident forced the brief closure of Australia's busiest airport and surrounding roads. According to Civil Aviation Safety Australia, ""fuel mayday"" calls are an automatic requirement when planes tap into reserve supplies of fuel. Strong headwinds, weather conditions and changes in route and altitude are all factors that could eat into fuel levels, said spokesman Peter Gibson. The plane would have had at least 45 minutes of flying time in its reserves, he said.","A United Airlines flight has landed safely at Sydney Airport after issuing a mayday call due to low fuel reserves, authorities have said."
"Then, seven years later, he became the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be forced from office by a no-confidence vote. Mr Rajoy's supporters had seen him as the crisis manager who averted an economic bailout, a quietly effective leader capable of maintaining the country's unity as the separatism movement hit tense heights in the north-eastern region of Catalonia. Yet his critics accused him of favouring economic shock therapy, hitting the poorest the hardest, of being heavy-handed towards the separatists, and turning a blind eye to corruption in his own party. Friend and foe alike agreed that the lanky man in glasses was not the most charismatic of politicians but Mr Rajoy, in fairness, did not promise fireworks. The rise through the ranks Born the Roman Catholic son of a lawyer in 1955, Mr Rajoy was brought up in Santiago de Compostela, north-western Spain, and after studying law became a land registrar. Elected a PP regional deputy at the age of 26, he climbed through the ranks, serving as a minister in the Aznar governments of 1996-2004. He held various ministerial roles before taking the leadership for the 2004 election. Despite being tipped to win a third term, the PP crashed out of office; its shock defeat blamed on the Madrid train bombings and the outgoing prime minister's handling of the atrocity. As leader of the opposition, Mr Rajoy struggled to rebuild his party's fortunes and was defeated again in 2008, though the party increased its share of the vote and seats. Third time lucky Mr Rajoy won the 2011 general election on a promise to tackle the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. He oversaw an EU-backed period of austerity, steering Spain back to growth, though critics say much of the recovery is fragile and often the only jobs people can get are low-paid and insecure. The PP party lost its majority at the inconclusive 2015 general election but soldiered on, increasing its share of the seats in the following year's poll to form a minority government. One of the biggest challenges of Mr Rajoy's time in office was the Catalonia crisis. When Catalan separatists held a referendum in October 2017 and declared independence unilaterally, Mr Rajoy's government declared the move illegal and dissolved the region's parliament. Defeated by parliament Mr Rajoy was forced out of office by a no-confidence vote in parliament on 1 June 2018. The opposition said he had failed to take responsibility for his party's involvement in a corruption scandal. The criticism had been bubbling for some time but gathered strength after a former PP treasurer was convicted of receiving bribes, money laundering and tax crimes. As Mr Rajoy departed, he told Spanish MPs that it was ""an honour to leave a better Spain than I found"". He will be succeeded by Pedro Sánchez from the Spanish Socialist Party, the party that triggered the no-confidence vote.","Mariano Rajoy was the patient man of Spanish politics, rewarded in 2011 at his third attempt to lead the conservative Popular Party (PP) to victory in a general election."
"The Jamaat-e-Islami chief was found guilty of charges including murder, torture and rape. He is the most senior figure convicted so far. The verdict was cheered by his opponents but set off protests in which at least 30 people were killed. Critics said the charges were politically motivated. Lawyers for Sayeedi say they plan to appeal in the Supreme Court. The Jamaat-e-Islami party rejects the tribunal and staged a strike on Thursday in protest. After the verdict was announced it called a further two-day stoppage for Sunday and Monday. Thousands of police have been deployed in Dhaka to maintain security. As well as the 30 killed, at least 300 people were injured in clashes between police and Jamaat supporters across the country, police told the Reuters news agency. Jamaat was opposed to Bangladeshi independence but denies any role in war crimes committed by pro-Pakistan militias. Official estimates say more than three million people were killed in the war. Angry demonstrations Security was tight around the capital, Dhaka, as the judgement was being read out. On hearing the verdict, protesters gathered at a busy intersection in the city erupted into cheers. ""We've been waiting for this day for the last four decades,"" one man told local television, the Agence France-Presse news agency reports. Thousands had staged a protest in the capital on Wednesday, demanding the death sentence be handed down to him. Recent weeks have seen a series of angry demonstrations demanding the execution of Jamaat leaders being tried by the tribunal. But there have also been protests against the court. The verdict is the third issued by the controversial tribunal, which is trying a total of nine Jamaat leaders and two members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Sayeedi was accused of working with the al-Badr group during the independence struggle and carrying out numerous atrocities, including forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. His critics say that during the war he formed a small group to loot and seize the property of Bengali Hindus and those who supported independence. The tribunal found Sayeedi guilty of eight out of the 20 charges levelled against him. These were murder, torture, rape and forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. State prosecutor Syed Haider Ali described the verdict as a ""victory for the people"", AFP reports. But in court Mr Sayeedi protested, blaming the judgement on the influence of bloggers and pro-government forces. Earlier this month another Jamaat leader, Abdul Kader Mullah, was sentenced to life for crimes against humanity. Huge crowds have been demanding he be executed. In January, former party leader Abul Kalam Azad was found guilty in absentia of eight charges of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. In the wake of the public outcry calling for the execution of Abdul Kader Mullah, Bangladesh's parliament earlier this month amended a law which will allow the state to appeal against his life sentence. The special court was set up in 2010 by the current Bangladeshi government to deal with those accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces who attempted to stop East Pakistan (as Bangladesh was then) from becoming an independent country. But human rights groups have said the tribunal falls short of international standards. Jamaat and the BNP accuse the current government of pursuing a political vendetta.",A tribunal in Bangladesh has sentenced Islamist leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi to death for crimes committed during the country's 1971 war of independence.
"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke at the televised event, along with Muslim leaders and a survivor of the attack. Cat Stevens, the British singer who converted to Islam in the 1970s, also performed. More than 20,000 people attended the event at the city's Hagley Park, amid tight security. Addressing the crowd in the park near the Al Noor mosque, where more than 40 people were killed earlier this month, Ms Ardern said New Zealand had ""a responsibility to be the place we wish to be"". ""We are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been,"" she said, ""but we can be the nation that discovers the cure"". In all, 50 people died on 15 March when a white supremacist attacked two mosques in Christchurch, while livestreaming part of his attack on Facebook. Ms Arden described how the world had been ""stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism breeding extremism"" but said ""the answer lies in our humanity"". Wearing a Maori cloak, she received a standing ovation as she took to the stage. Dozens of government representatives from around the world attended the memorial, including the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. Farid Ahmed, who survived the attack by a far-right gunman but whose wife Husna was killed, made a plea for peace. He said he had forgiven the gunman. ""I don't want a heart that is boiling like a volcano,"" he said. ""I want a heart that will be full of love and care, and will have mercy."" Resilience and recovery by Hywel Griffith at Hagley Park, Christchurch Two weeks may have passed, but the events of 15 March still weigh heavily on people here. They gathered on the verdant fields of Hagley Park to honour victims very few of them would have known. Some women wore headscarves, as a sign of solidarity towards followers of Islam. As the names of the dead were read out, thousands stood in sombre silence. One woman told me how proud she was of how Jacinda Ardern has represented the nation in its grief. But there was also an emphasis here on resilience and recovery - the need to stay united as normal life slowly starts to return. Cat Stevens, whose Muslim name is Yusuf Islam, sang his songs Peace Train and Don't be Shy. ""It's only when good people stay sitting that evil rises,"" he said. ""We've seen the opposite in this country."" Shaggaf Khan, president of the Muslim Council of Canterbury, praised New Zealand's response to the attacks and said he felt ""ultimately hopeful"". ""From this hate, how much love has been shared? Out of this darkness, how much light has been spread?"" he asked the crowd. The mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, called on social media platforms to ""take more responsibility"". The shootings were live-streamed on Facebook and shared worldwide before the social media network could remove the footage. ""We each have a responsibility to ask the hard questions of ourselves about what comfort we give to people who might harbour racist or hateful views,"" she said. All 50 names of the victims who died in the attacks were read out at the event by members of the city's Muslim community. The victims included men, women and children from across the world. The youngest victim was just three years old. There are still 22 people recovering in hospital, including a critically injured four-year-old girl. Many had moved to New Zealand in the hope of a better life and some were refugees. Ms Ardern described the attacks as one of the nation's ""darkest days"". Since the mass shooting, Ms Ardern has announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the remembrance service was one of the largest security events ever conducted by the police. The service was livestreamed at smaller events across the country, but the New Zealand Herald reported that many of these were cancelled due to stretched police resources.","A memorial service has been held in Christchurch, New Zealand, and screened around the nation, to honour the 50 victims of the 15 March shootings."
"The Irish government scheme is part of a five year rural development policy, released on Monday. Under the plan, a fifth of public servants would shift to remote or home working by the end of the year. The government says it is an invitation to remote workers to live in rural Ireland. It will also introduce legislation this year to give employees the right to request to work remotely. The Irish government's Our Rural Future strategy proposes a national network of 400 remote working hubs, including ones specifically for the public sector. It is the first European country to come up with such a plan. Rural and Community Development Minister Heather Humphreys said it was ""the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural Ireland in decades"". ""As we emerge from Covid-19, the new policy is about maximising a recovery for all parts of the country and giving a better quality of life to people who live and work in rural areas."" Concern about the pre-eminence of Dublin and the need for decentralisation of civil service jobs is a perennial theme in Irish political discourse. A previous attempt to move government departments outside of the capital was a failure. Civil servants who had bought homes and had children at school in the city were very reluctant to sell-up to move to areas where they may have had no connections. But this time the government is hoping it will be different because the focus will be more on individuals than on civil service departments. And the pandemic experience of working from home has proved there is such an appetite. But to work broadband speeds in rural areas will need to improve from all too often very slow to superfast - just one of the many challenges the government faces as it looks to a future beyond the pandemic. The report commits to ""explore the potential to develop a pilot scheme to support the use of rural pubs as community spaces and hubs for local services"". The minister likened it to the UK's ""the hub in the pub"" concept. ""We are teasing out how, maybe, pubs can be used for different purposes during the day,"" she said. ""It could be working spaces. It could be community spaces. It could be many different things and we can look at having high-speed broadband there."" Broadband concern Cork South West TD (Irish MP) Michael Collins said such a plan would need high-speed, reliable broadband - which his constituents did not always have, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported. As part of the new strategy, the government has proposed investing up to €2.7bn (£2.3bn) in the roll-out of the national broadband plan. ""There are huge issues. Many people have come back from the cities to work in rural communities and the broadband is shocking. ""I have hundreds and hundreds of people in west Cork pulling their hair out of their heads because they can't get broadband in their homes."" Northern Ireland's civil service is currently developing an ""enduring"" remote-working policy with trade unions. In February, the Department of Finance announced 10 regional hubs for public sector workers. Cross-border welcome The Cross Border Workers Coalition welcomed the commitment of ministers ""north and south"" to remote working. However ""restrictive"" cross border tax rules continued to leave rural communities behind, the organisation's co-chair Aidan O'Kane said. ""Under current legislation, cross border workers who live in the Republic of Ireland and work for an Northern Ireland-based company can face a 'double tax' on their income if they work remotely. ""Employees should be able to live in towns across the island regardless of where their job is based."" The Irish government has included a tax review for remote workers and employers as part of its strategy.",Irish pubs could be turned into remote working hubs under a post-pandemic plan to give rural villages a new lease on life.
"Prosecutors said Roxana Baldetti took a 50% cut of illegal payments channelled to officials helping businesses evade customs duties. She was arrested last week over the scheme and denies wrongdoing. Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina has apologised but said he would not resign over the matter. Addressing the nation on Sunday, he rejected any link to the scandal and said his conscience was clear. Eight members of his government have resigned over the allegations and nearly 30 people detained. In court, Ms Baldetti - who resigned in May - spoke to confirm her identity, taking notes as prosecutors played some of the wiretapped conversations that led to her detention.

"He made his case at a high school in Las Vegas, Nevada, a day after a bipartisan group of senators outlined a framework for reform. The White House and senators envisage a path to citizenship for many of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. The move reflects the growing influence of Hispanic voters. In his opening remarks, Mr Obama said: ""The time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform."" He noted that the current system was ""out of date and badly broken"". Bipartisan approach? Mr Obama's case for an immigration revamp reflects a blueprint he rolled out in 2011, though that did not go far, to the disappointment of Latino voters. On Tuesday, the US president championed the proposals outlined a day earlier by a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators. ""The good news is that for the first time in many years Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together,"" he said. But Mr Obama added that if Congress did not take action, the White House would write legislation of its own and insist that lawmakers vote on it. Like the bipartisan plan, the president also backed an overhaul of the existing legal immigration system and securing US borders. His 2011 blueprint also focused on a path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship, as well as making it easier for businesses to verify the legal status of workers. After eight years, individuals would be allowed to become legal permanent residents and could eventually become citizens five years later. Appeal to Hispanics Under the White House and senators' plans, undocumented immigrants would be allowed to live and work in the US legally as long as they pass background checks and pay back-taxes. Once immigrants were able to apply for permanent residency, they would do so behind everyone else who had already applied for a green card. But the senators' proposals would allow undocumented immigrants to start the process of becoming citizens only after US borders are deemed secure, a link that did not feature in the president's plan. The so-called gang of eight hope their blueprint could pass the Senate by summer. Such a bill would face a tougher route in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. But many Republicans recognise their party's hard line on immigration has become a liability, after November's election when the Democratic president won more than 70% of the Latino vote. Arizona Senator John McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate who lost to Mr Obama in 2008, said on Monday: ""The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens.""",President Barack Obama has said the time has come for a sweeping overhaul of the US immigration system.
"Staff at St-Martin-la-Plaine zoo near Lyon say the endangered animal got free by scaling branches broken by recent snowfall. It was last seen by a motorist less than 5km (3.1 miles) away, near Saint-Maurice-sur-Dargoire. A Facebook post asked residents to keep a look out for the red panda, but warned people not to try to catch it. ""Even if it's a little harmless animal with silky fur, it has good claws and good teeth,"" the post read. Staff described the nocturnal animal - reportedly a three-year-old male - as an ""outstanding climber who is not afraid of heights"", asking people to ""look up in the trees"". According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, red pandas are native to the forests of the Himalayas. They can be found in Bhutan, Nepal, north-eastern India, northern Myanmar and south-western China. The creatures are not closely related to giant pandas, despite the similar name. Deforestation has cut their numbers, and though poaching rates have declined, the red panda is still at risk from hunters. The animals are officially classed as endangered. Two other red pandas have been in the news this year after staging daring escapes.

He had called Mexican migrants ""criminals"" and ""rapists"". Such remarks led President Pena Nieto to compare the American to Italian fascist leader Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. Mr Videgaray has been one of the president's closest advisers, orchestrating a successful election campaign in 2012. However, Mr Trump's visit almost immediately caused public relations problems, when he appeared later that day at a rally in Arizona. There, he told the crowd Mexico would ""100%"" pay for a planned border wall, though he told reporters he had not discussed the issue with President Pena Nieto. The president later insisted he had told Mr Trump that Mexico would not pay. In 2014, Mr Videgaray came under fire when a newspaper investigation revealed he had bought his home from a construction firm whose parent company had won major public contracts. He denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest. President Pena Nieto said the new minister will ""apply adjustments to public spending"" but there will not be any rise in taxes.",Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray has resigned following the visit of Donald Trump last week.
"The avalanche of recent sexual harassment cases did not just affect the entertainment industry, she said, but ""transcend any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace"". Oprah dedicated her Cecil B. DeMille award to ""all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault"". She also mentioned an unfamiliar name: Recy Taylor. So who was Recy Taylor? Ms Taylor, 24, was abducted, blindfolded and raped on her way home from an Alabama church in 1944 by six armed white men. They warned her that if she said anything about it they would kill her. The brutal crime was eventually reported to the civil rights organisation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The NAACP passed it on to Rosa Parks, who was sent to Abbeville, Alabama to investigate. The now iconic civil rights hero would, in 1955, rise to prominence when she refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus. But at that time, she was focused on documenting sexual crimes against black women. One of Mrs Taylor's attackers confessed to the crime but her attackers were never indicted by all-white, male grand juries, as a result of segregation and racial inequality. The incident left Ms Taylor ""afraid of living"", she told NPR in 2011. She stopped going out at night ""'cause I was afraid that maybe something else might happen"". Many incidents involving black victims went unpunished in the south of the United States at the time. This was as a result of discriminatory legislation, collectively known as the ""Jim Crow"" laws, which segregated black people and white people in public spaces and strengthened discriminatory attitudes. In recent years, interest in Mrs Taylor's case has risen. A book and a documentary - The Rape of Recy Taylor - have been released in the last few years. In 2011, a formal apology to Mrs Taylor was made by the Alabama Legislature, calling the decision not to prosecute ""morally abhorrent and repugnant."" Recy Taylor died last month aged 97, just days before her 98th birthday. Ms Taylor, Oprah said, ""lived as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men."" But, she added, ""their time is up. Their time is up!"" She continued: ""I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth, like the truth of so many other women who were tormented in those years, and even now tormented, goes marching on."" Sunday's ceremony came after several months of sexual harassment allegations in the film and television industries.",Oprah Winfrey's powerful speech at the Golden Globes highlighted the impact of sexual abuse and racism on women's lives.
"Police in Auburn said they arrested the artist after a woman called emergency services at 03:48 (10:48 GMT) to report a sex assault. The singer strongly denies the allegations and has now been released. ""I have not been charged... therefore no bail was required,"" he tweeted. ""I was released, pending further investigation."" The singer tweeted that he was ""beyond shocked that I have been targeted with this false allegation"". ""I am completely innocent,"" he said. ""I am confident that once the facts are looked at, it will be very clear that I am the victim of a false allegation."" Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr, was taken into custody on a second degree rape charge, TMZ said. In a statement his lawyer also described the allegation as ""completely fabricated"".

In 2015 he was arrested on felony charges after police found drugs and guns on board his tour bus.

"After being besieged by record unemployment, low consumer confidence and a new recession, President Hollande would have welcomed a change in his fortunes. But when Closer magazine published pictures purporting to show him and actress Julie Gayet arriving at a Paris flat and alleged that the pair had been having an affair, the headlines got even worse. The story generated attention across the world but the French public appeared to have little appetite for details about their leader's love life. Indeed, one opinion poll even suggested that news of his second affair had provided him with a three-point boost in his approval rating among women. But with unemployment continuing to rise, Mr Hollande's personal troubles could not distract him from the reality that he had become the country's least popular president of modern times. Party career Mr Hollande was born the son of a doctor on 12 August 1954 in the north-western city of Rouen. He attended Sciences Po and another elite institution, ENA, where he met Segolene Royal. Ms Royal would go on to become his partner of nearly three decades and the mother of his four children, although the couple later split. Having been active in student politics, Mr Hollande joined the Socialist party in 1979 and played a junior role as an economic adviser in the presidency of Francois Mitterrand. A member of parliament since 1988, he represents a constituency in the south-central region of Correze. He succeeded Lionel Jospin as party leader in 1997, a post he retained for more than a decade. All the president's women In 2008, amid acrimony over the defeat of Ms Royal by Mr Sarkozy at the previous year's presidential election, he stood down. It later emerged he had been having an affair with Valerie Trierweiler, a political reporter with current affairs magazine Paris Match. Ms Trierweiler moved in with the president after his official separation from Ms Royal in 2007 and followed him to the Elysee Palace when the Socialist candidate was elected president in 2012. But the couple split after it emerged that the Mr Hollande had had another affair - this time with French actress Julie Gayet. He confirmed their separation after Ms Trierweiler spent a week in hospital after the affair was made public in the gossip magazine Closer in January 2014. In yet another twist, Mr Hollande chose to appoint Ms Royal to his cabinet in March 2014, making her the new minister for environment, sustainable development and energy. Ms Royal had apparently been blackballed by a notoriously jealous Ms Trierweiler during the selection of the president's first cabinet so it was a further sign that Mr Hollande's relationship with Ms Trierweiler was dead and buried. 'Painful' Ms Royal's stunning comeback came after the Socialists were left badly bruised by big local election losses and bleak economic data at the end of March. The humiliating poll results, which saw big gains for conservatives and the far-right National Front (FN), forced the president into his first major reshuffle. In a short televised address after the elections, Mr Hollande vowed to lead a ""fighting government"" and said it was ""time for a new direction"". But further humiliation followed in May's European Parliament election, when the FN stormed to victory and pushed Mr Hollande's Socialists into third place. The French president described the results, which left his party with its lowest ever score, as ""painful"" and called for renewed EU focus on economic growth. Indeed correspondents say his presidency now depends on the economy. In August, he was forced to name a new cabinet under Prime Minister Manual Valls after dropping three ministers who rebelled against austerity cuts. And in November, he admitted he had made mistakes since taking office but vowed to go ""to the end"" with changes. He said he would not seek re-election in 2017 if he failed to cut unemployment. As his approval rating dropped to an all-time-low of 12%, Mr Hollande was left struggling to both boost his popularity and push forward with reforms that have so far failed to bear fruit.","The economic woes that dominated Francois Hollande's first year as French president continued well into his second, but it was an exclusive story in a gossip magazine that caused most embarrassment for the Socialist leader."
"The crew of Camera Trap will film on the island for three weeks before completing filming in Nepal in February. The film follows a British wildlife camera crew as they pursue sightings of a rare wildcat in Central Asia. It is described by producers as ""atmospheric and terrifyingly real"". It marks the 101st production to use the island since the film industry's inception in 1995. Laurence Skelly MHK, member for department of economic development with responsibility for film and media, said: ""It is already shaping up to be a busy year for the Manx film industry and our local film professionals, many of whom are busily working on Camera Trap at the moment."" Isle of Man Film's Hilary Dugdale added: ""Yet again the island has provided us stunning film exteriors for this project.

"Addressing a rally on Saturday, he had said, ""look at what's happening last night in Sweden"", as he listed parts of Europe hit by terrorist attacks. With no such incident reported in Sweden on Friday, the country asked the US administration for an explanation. Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that he had been referring to a TV report. He said it had been broadcast on Fox News but did not say when. He may have been referring to a Fox News programme on Friday night, which looked at refugees and crime in Sweden. Despite his words ""happening last night in Sweden"", White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said separately that Mr Trump had been talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general, not referring to a specific issue. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt was among those who mocked Mr Trump's comment, suggesting that he had ""been smoking"". Social media users ridiculed the American leader, joking about imaginary situations involving Swedish institutions like the pop group Abba and furniture store Ikea. The mocking hashtag #lastnightinSweden was soon trending on Twitter. Many made reference to the ""Bowling Green massacre"", a non-existent attack cited by one of President Trump's key advisers, Kellyanne Conway, earlier this month. @Sweden responds On Sunday, a librarian was in charge of Sweden's national twitter account, @Sweden, which is run by a different Swedish resident every week. It fell on her to field countless inquiries about Mr Trump's remarks. ""I was just myself and told the truth,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme on Monday. ""I am a school librarian as a profession, so I just went out and checked all the main newspapers in Sweden and radio channels, and I just concluded it was not true."" What Trump said On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted: ""My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden."" The Fox News report looked at gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. Fox News is known to be among Donald Trump's favourite cable TV channels. President Trump's initial remarks about Sweden came at a big rally in Florida on Saturday. ""You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden,"" he said. ""Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels, you look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice, take a look at Paris."" What actually happened No terrorist incidents were reported in Sweden on Friday. Sweden's Aftonbladet website summarised the news events of that day, which included: Refugee haven Sweden, with a population of about 9.5m, has taken in nearly 200,000 refugees and migrants in recent years - more per capita than any other European country. It saw a sharp increase in asylum seekers in 2015, with more than 160,000 people arriving. With the influx, tensions also rose with some isolated attacks on immigrants, as well as pro- and anti-migrant demonstrations. The killing of a 22-year-old woman in January 2016 by an asylum seeker based at the centre where she worked put further pressure on the government to reassess its approach to refugees. There was a drop in numbers last year after the country introduced new border checks incurring longer processing times, as well as financial incentives for migrants who voluntarily returned to their country of origin. No terrorist attacks have been recorded in Sweden since the country's open-door policy on migration began in 2013. However, Sweden is believed to have the highest number of Islamic State fighters per capita in Europe. About 140 of the 300 who went to Syria and Iraq have since returned, leaving the authorities to grapple with how best to reintegrate them into society. How Sweden became an exporter of jihad",US President Donald Trump has sought to explain why he referred to a security incident in Sweden on Friday which did not actually happen.
"No injuries were reported from the vigil shooting, which police said was caused by a ""disturbance"". In the party shooting on Saturday night in Greenville, Texas, two died and 12 were injured. Police are still searching for the gunman, whose identity and motive remain unknown. The vigil was held on Sunday at a park in Dallas for 23-year-old Kevin Barry, named by his family as one of the two killed at the party. As the vigil was ending, multiple gunshots were heard, causing mourners and reporters to take cover, according to local media reports. What happened at the party? Some 750 people gathered on Saturday at an event space in Greenville, about 15 miles (24km) south-west of a Texas A&M University satellite campus in the town of Commerce. Officials said it was a Halloween and homecoming party for the university, though it was not a school-sanctioned event. Many of the partygoers were college students in their late teens and early 20s. Shortly before midnight, gunshots rang out, causing hundreds of people to flee. Police said initial witness reports indicated that the shooter had targeted his first victim before turning his handgun on the crowd and firing at random. The gunman is believed to have fled in the resulting chaos. County Sheriff Randy Meeks told reporters he was ""appalled"" that the police had not been able to get a better description of the shooter from one of the many witnesses. ""Due to the many different descriptions being provided by those in attendance at that party, we unfortunately do not have any solid suspect information to provide at this time,"" he said during a press conference on Sunday. Police said the two killed were both males. Of the 12 injured, six were being treated for gunshot wounds. At least four are in critical condition. The rest were injured by glass or being trampled. The FBI and the Texas Rangers - a state-wide investigative agency - are helping in the investigation.",Gunfire erupted during a vigil for a man who was killed in a shooting at a party in Texas the night before.
"By Jonathan Paye-LaylehBBC Africa, Monrovia These days body bags have replaced caskets as the corpses of Ebola victims are highly contagious and they must be carefully sealed within them before burial or cremation. Funerals - big social events, when friends and family would gather around an open casket, often touching their loved one to bid farewell - are also a thing of the past. ""Because of this Ebola situation, people hardly buy from us these days,"" says carpenter Titus Mulbah, showing visible signs of disappointment when I turned out not to be a customer. In his mid-20s, he is one of a group running the Talented Brothers Casket Centre on Somalia Drive in the capital, Monrovia. From humble beginnings, it has grown to occupy two plots, displaying many different kinds of caskets, under corrugated iron roofs along a stretch of road which links the port to the east of the city. Before the outbreak of Ebola, Mr Mulbah said business was good with funeral services all over the city especially at weekends. ""For the last two months it has been difficult to sell even one casket a day,"" Mr Mulbah laments. ""And this is all because all bodies now are considered Ebola bodies, as if other diseases are not killing people here."" The coffin maker says there is no space to put new stock ""so we come here just to sit and sleep all day and go back home"". Undertakers fear corpse contact As he speaks a van mounted with loud speakers broadcasting Ebola information messages passes by. As has become common practice everywhere, the coffin shop follows new protocols including the regular washing of hands and avoiding bodily contact. ""We have brought the prices down, but still people are not coming to buy,"" Mr Mulbah says. ""It hurts; but we have to abide by the government's rules."" Even more frustrating is that people who made advance payments for coffins are asking for refunds, he adds. Undertakers are also being affected, with formal burials being abandoned. But Moses Ahoussouhe, proprietor of the St Moses Funeral Parlours in the same area, said he backed the safety measures, as he did want to come into contact with bodies that may not have been tested for Ebola. ""We prefer going short on cash now, compared to doing the wrong things and getting affected; so we go by the flow of the government's restriction and policy,"" he told the BBC. Following resistance from some communities to having Ebola victims buried in their area, it has been decreed that people dying from Ebola in the Monrovia area be cremated. The government has had to hire experts and bring in a crematorium so that bodies are not burnt in the open. ""We know cremation is not our culture in our country; our culture is burial,"" said Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant health minister, who heads the government's Ebola response. ""But now we have disease; so we have to change the way we used to do business."" Secret burials However, Mr Nyenswah said fear of cremation had led many to remain at home to die instead of seeking treatment. A recent analysis of bed space at Ebola treatment centres showed that out of 742, 391 were vacant, he said. How not to catch Ebola: Ebola special report ""We understand that there are secret burials taking place in the communities; let's stop that and report sick people and get them treated."" Health ministry officials say tests are done to ensure that only the bodies of Ebola victims are cremated; but some people have complained that those who have died of other causes have also been included. ""I lost my relative who was never tested or treated; she died and the body was cremated,"" said television journalist Eddie Harmon, adding that it was ""unjust and unfair"". The families of Ebola victims do not have any control over what happens to the bodies. Graveyard day They will also have to come to terms with the fact that they will never see the graves of their loved ones. Visiting cemeteries is an important part of the culture here. The second Wednesday in March is a public holiday - National Decoration Day - when most people go to cemeteries to clean and redecorate the graves of their relatives. The hasty removal of Ebola victims means these days will be a painful reminder of the virus' legacy for many families, without any physical monument to mark their lives. When President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf declared the state of emergency in August, she summed up the despair of many with the words: ""Ebola has attacked our way of life."" Back at the casket centre, Mr Mulbah keeps his eyes on the road looking out for customers. But the vehicles stopping only drop off passengers who walk in the opposite direction. He clings to the belief that has become prevalent in Liberia that the coming dry season will somehow break the epidemic - heavy rain can make roads impassable and hamper aid efforts in a country with little infrastructure. ""We want see Ebola go so that we can get back into business,"" he says.",Liberia's coffin trade is suffering as a consequence of the Ebola outbreak ravaging this West Africa nation.
"HM Revenue and Customs has published a list of those schemes which providers said would follow new rules brought in to tackle tax avoidance. Only three of Guernsey's Qualified Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (or QROPS) are on the list. To comply, the schemes need to be for local, Guernsey residents only. If they are set up for people resident elsewhere, taxes will become due which will render them uncompetitive. Mark Chipperfield, a senior financial adviser at Rossborough's in Guernsey, said it was bad news for the estimated 200 people employed in the local industry. He said: ""It's going to be very difficult for any QROPS providers in Guernsey to take on new business. ""There's still going to be a need for staff to maintain existing schemes but... most of the work in setting up a QROPS is at the beginning.""","The jobs of up to 200 people working in Guernsey's specialist pensions industry could be under threat, following changes to UK compliance rules."

Dr Ewart described an unexplained case on 30 Match as ""disappointing"". However, she said there was no indication of further uncontrolled spread from it and most transmission was now taking place within homes where people were already isolating. She said that would ""carry on until it burns itself out and there are no more household members left to become infected"". Infections within isolating households had a ""natural end point"" and should not ""lead to reseeding in the community"", she said. ""We can be confident so long as people observe their self-isolation that those chains of transmission are contained.""

"Demonstrators brandished photos of a woman who was beaten and dragged along the ground, exposing her underwear - an incident that has outraged Egyptians. The rally took place in Tahrir Square, which has seen five days of deadly clashes between protesters and troops. The ruling military council has said it deeply regrets any ""transgressions"" against women protesters. 'Shocking' On Monday, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused Egypt's police and soldiers of deliberately targeting women. Speaking in Washington, Mrs Clinton said that women were being humiliated in the same streets where they had risked their lives for the revolution. ""This systematic degradation of Egyptian women dishonours the revolution, disgraces the state and its uniform and is not worthy of a great people,"" she told an audience at Georgetown University. She called the events of the past few days ""shocking"". At Tuesday's rally in Cairo, some women shouted: ""Our honour is a red line"". Protester Nawara Negm said the security forces were deliberately trying to humiliate women. ""They know that people who don't care about their own lives they care about their mother, wife and sister. So they wanted to humiliate the whole Egyptian people by humiliating women because they know it's very sensitive,"" she told the BBC. ""[The ruling generals] have to go, they are traitors."" In a statement, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces expressed its ""strong regret to the great women of Egypt over transgressions that occurred during recent incidents in the protests outside parliament and the cabinet"". 'Deranged' Earlier, General Adil Emara, a member of the military council, said that the attack on the woman was an isolated incident and was under investigation. ""We have nothing to hide,"" he insisted. The council also said it would open an investigation into accusations that soldiers carried out virginity tests on women protesters in March. Earlier, security forces clashed with protesters who returned to protest against the military for a fifth day. At least 13 people have been killed since the latest clashes began on Friday, just after the second round of the country's parliamentary elections. There are reports of injuries resulting from Tuesday's clashes, but so far no deaths. Meanwhile, a retired Egyptian army general who still acts as a military adviser, Abdul Moneim Kato, caused outrage by saying that some protesters deserve to be thrown into ""Hitler's ovens"".

"They named him as Khuram Shaikh. The Foreign Office confirmed a man had died but did not release any other details. Next of kin have been told. Police said the incident happened early on 25 December at a resort in Tangalle, about 100 miles south of Colombo. Mr Shaikh and a Russian woman were attacked after reportedly arguing with a man. Four men have been arrested. Superintendent of Police Ajith Rohana told the BBC's Sinhala service that while two of the suspects were thought to have been directly connected to the assault, the third man had been arrested for providing a vehicle for the attackers. All three are Sri Lankan, but police did not name them. A fourth man - Sampath Chandra Pushpa Vidanapathirana, 24, the chairman of Tangalle village council - was arrested after going to police on 26 December, police said. A post-mortem examination showed Mr Shaikh had been attacked by a sharp weapon and shot, he added. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the victim's next of kin had been informed, and consular assistance was being provided.

"Dr Ruhakana Rugunda told the BBC that all people, gay or otherwise, should get full access to medical treatment. Aid charities warn the new bill will have ""disastrous"" effects on the country's response to HIV. Uganda is a very conservative society where many people oppose homosexuality. Homosexual acts were already illegal in Uganda, but the new law bans the promotion of homosexuality and covers lesbians for the first time. Western governments have condemned President Yoweri Museveni's decision to approve the bill, which gives life sentences for gay sex and same-sex marriage. Promises of confidentiality The Ugandan authorities sought to give assurances on Tuesday, after several Western nations condemned the signing of the tough new anti-gay law. Mr Rugunda urged gay people to be honest with healthcare workers, particularly when discussing treatment for HIV. ""All people whether they are sexual orientation as gays or otherwise are at complete liberty to get full treatment and to give full disclosure to their doctors and nurses,"" he told the BBC. He adds: ""And by the way, health workers will live up to their ethics of keeping confidentiality of their patients."" Western governments have threatened to withdraw international aid to Uganda, which the country's fragile health system relies heavily on, says the BBC's Tulip Mazumdar. Uganda receives a reported $400m (£240m) in annual aid from the US, which has begun to review its assistance programmes in Uganda in the wake of the passing of the new law. But Dr Rugunda said he was confident the US would not restrict funds and said if it does, Uganda would cope. US Secretary of State John Kerry said Mr Museveni's decision to sign the bill marked a ""tragic day for Uganda and for all who care about the cause of human rights"". But the Ugandan authorities have defended the decision, saying President Museveni wanted ""to demonstrate Uganda's independence in the face of Western pressure and provocation"". The sponsor of the bill, MP David Bahati, insisted homosexuality was a ""behaviour that can be learned and can be unlearned"". There are already concerns of a witch-hunt against gay people in Uganda after popular tabloid Red Pepper published on Tuesday a list of the country's ""200 top homosexuals"" under the headline: ""Exposed"". In 2011, a Ugandan gay activist was killed after his name appeared in a similar list published by the now-defunct Ugandan Rolling Stone magazine, calling for the execution of gay people.

"Soleimani, viewed as a terrorist by the White House, was the architect of Iran's Middle East operations and Iran has vowed to take ""severe revenge"". The funeral procession which began in Baghdad on Saturday marks the beginning of days of mourning for Soleimani. His body is due to be returned to Iran for burial in his home town. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has promised members of the dead commander's family that Americans will ""feel the impact"" of their ""criminal act... for years ahead"". The crowds in Baghdad were also there to mourn the death of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi who commanded the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group and effectively led the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) - an umbrella of militias in Iraq dominated by groups aligned with Iran. Both Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, where the US embassy is located, and Balad air base north of the city came under rocket fire on Saturday but there were no immediate reports of casualties. How did the Iraqi stage of the funeral proceed? Mourners gathered in Baghdad in the early hours, waving Iraqi and militia flags and chanting ""death to America"". The funeral began at the city's Al Muthana Airport, then moved to the gate of the Green Zone. As the procession snaked though the streets, some mourners carried portraits of Soleimani while others held portraits of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Later, the procession left for the Shia Muslim holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. Reports say the bodies of Soleimani and four other Iranians killed in the air strike will be flown on Saturday evening to Iran, which has declared three days of mourning for the assassinated general. His funeral in Iran is to be held on Tuesday. Some Iraqis, conversely, celebrated in Baghdad's streets at the news of Soleimani's death. He was accused of orchestrating violent crackdowns on peaceful pro-democracy protests there in recent months. Iran's retaliation is certain, but when, where, how is not. For now, the priority is to cement Qasem Soleimani's status as a national hero, to ensure he remains powerful in death as in life. Elaborate plans for his funeral have been expanded, a mix of carefully scripted ceremony with outpourings of grief filling the streets. It begins in Baghdad where he died, and where so much of his legacy lives. From there his remains travel to Iran's holy city of Mashhad, to his hometown Kerman, and then to Tehran where the supreme leader will preside over final prayers - a rare honour, to send another signal. Ayatollah Khamenei has promoted his loyal officer to lieutenant general. More important is to elevate his martyrdom, to draw in rivals who resented his status and Iranians who reviled his costly foreign adventures. Iranian leaders hope his killing will unite a nation as it stares at a far more uncertain future. How has Iran responded to the assassination? Its leaders have pledged to avenge the death of the man who led the Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Soleimani, 62, was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran after Ayatollah Khamenei. The Quds Force reported directly to the ayatollah, and Soleimani was hailed as a heroic national figure. Visiting Soleimani's family members at their house in Tehran, President Rouhani said: ""The Americans really did not realise what grave error they have committed. ""Revenge for his blood will be exacted on that day when the filthy hands of America will be cut off forever from the region."" Ayatollah Khamenei said earlier that revenge would be ""forceful"" while a senior IRGC general, Gholamali Abuhamzeh, said 35 US targets had been identified in the region ""as well as Tel Aviv"" - the most populous city in Israel. He also raised the prospect of attacks on US warships in the Gulf. At a march in Tehran on Saturday, one demonstrator told Reuters: ""[Soleimani] was a man who - unlike many of our officials - was an enemy for our enemies and treated our own people very well. Therefore he was very popular. So, the only thing we want of our statesmen and our supreme leader is... to take revenge."" Simmering US-Iranian hostilities had escalated rapidly last week after the US conducted air strikes in Iraq and Syria against Kataib Hezbollah, which the US blamed for an earlier rocket attack that killed an American civilian contractor. Pro-Iranian militia attacked the US embassy in Baghdad in response. In a letter to the UN Security Council, responding to the strike on Soleimani, Iran's UN ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said that Iran reserved the right to self-defence under international law. Analysts said Iran could deploy cyber-attacks against the US, or attempt to strike US military targets or interests in the Middle East. What measures is the US taking? It says it has deployed an additional 3,000 troops to the Middle East to help respond to any backlash from the strike. US citizens have been advised to leave Iraq immediately via any means possible, while the UK Foreign Office hardened its travel advice for Iran and Iraq. Two previous US presidents, Barack Obama and George W Bush, had rejected a strike on the general as too risky. Defending the operation to kill Soleimani, US President Donald Trump accused ""the number one terrorist anywhere in the world"" of ""plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel"". No details were given of the alleged planned attacks and a New York Times correspondent has quoted two unnamed US officials as telling her that evidence of such plotting was ""razor thin"". Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, that the US killing of Soleimani was an abuse of military power while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who also phoned Mr Zarif, said the killing ""grossly"" violated the norms of international law. Meanwhile, Iraq's PMF retracted their own report of a deadly new air strike on a convoy on Saturday, Reuters reports. How does Iraq fit into this? Iran supports a variety of Shia militia groups in neighbouring Iraq. Soleimani had just arrived at Baghdad airport and was travelling in a convoy alongside officials from such militia when their cars were hit by several US missiles. Iraq now finds itself in a difficult position as an ally both of Iran and of the US. Thousands of US troops remain in the country to assist in the broader struggle against the Sunni Muslim Islamic State (IS) group but Iraq's government insists the US has acted beyond the terms of this agreement. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi labelled the missile strike as a ""brazen violation of Iraq's sovereignty and a blatant attack on the nation's dignity"" and Iraq's parliament announced it would hold an emergency meeting on Sunday.","Thousands of Iraqis have followed the coffin of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, killed in a US air strike at Baghdad airport on Friday."
"By Alastair LeitheadBBC News, Africa correspondent A distant, guttural growl of elephants, and the occasional trumpet, drifted over the thick screen of lush trees and dry-scrub grass. The nearest calls were nearby, the furthest a mile or more away: this was the large herd we had been looking for. Tracking collars had pinpointed them at dawn, but these elephants move quickly, and after centuries of hunting, run if they see, or even smell, humans. The well armed rangers from the Mamba Two fast-response team fanned out ahead to the left and the right, not wanting to surprise, or be surprised by, a lone animal. They excitedly beckoned us to follow them slowly and carefully into a thicker section of trees. It had been a three-hour flight in a small plane, from Chad's capital, N'Djamena, to Zakouma National Park, and a three-hour drive to this section in search of the herd, the last of the park's elephants. Tens of thousands once lived in this reserve covering 3,800 sq km (1,470 sq miles), but for centuries it was the nearest place Sudanese horsemen could find ivory, much coveted by Arab traders along the Nile. Originally they hunted with spears and swords, but modern AK47 assault rifles allowed killing on an industrial scale. Janjaweed mercenaries from Dafur, in western Sudan, continue to be the biggest poaching threat, with heavily armed, military-trained raiding parties on horseback targeting the elephant herds for their tusks. Zakouma has lost 90% of the 22,000 elephants it had in the mid-1970s. War with Libya and the upsurge in demand for ivory reduced the population to 4,300 by the early 2000s, and the chaos of civil war cut that to less than 500 by 2010. Rangers were being killed, animals massacred in large groups, and it looked as if Zakouma's elephants were heading towards extinction. But in the past few years, an amazing transformation has taken place. In less than a decade a private, non-profit organisation has turned its fortunes around. African Parks manages some of the toughest to protect parks on the continent, and in Zakouma, at least, it has made incredible progress. ""We have rangers, and due to the threat that they face, they are military trained,"" says Zakouma park manager Leon Lamprecht. ""But they are ultimately doing law enforcement and not military operations. We are trying to stop poachers before they kill the assets that we protect."" African Parks calls what it does ""delegated management in partnership with governments and local communities"". It manages 13 protected areas in nine countries at the invitation of governments that lack the staff or resources required to protect their own wildlife. Zakouma hasn't lost an elephant in 18 months, or a ranger in five years, but it was an uphill struggle. In 2012, a patrol of seven rangers discovered a poachers' camp in the park, and waited overnight for them to return. But as they carried out their morning prayers at first light, the poachers attacked them. So African Parks introduced strict military-style training and tactics - to make sure rangers weren't caught unawares at the most vulnerable times of day - at dawn and at dusk. ""I think the term 'militarisation' of conservation isn't the greatest term. A better term is the 'professionalisation' of conservation,"" says the chief executive of African Parks, Peter Fearnhead. Poachers, he says, are often highly militarised themselves, are highly trained, have equipment that is very freely available and don't abide by any of the laws and regulations of countries. ""So in order to make sure the execution of the law enforcement function is done professionally, you have got to have very, very professionally trained people,"" he says. Adoum Allam is the sniper with Mamba Two patrol. He's 30, carries a long gun with a sight, and is doing the job his father did before he was killed by poachers, when Adoum was just eight. He went through two weeks of selection, eight weeks of basic training and another four weeks learning to shoot. ""It's a very dangerous job, but I love doing it,"" he says. It brings in money to support wife and four children, but he admits it is risky. Around his waist he wears six leather belt-like straps adorned with solid, square, leather amulets each containing a verse from the Koran. All the rangers wear these ""waragars"" to protect them from bullets. Those worn by the Adoum Allam's colleague who mans the high-calibre weapon mounted on their vehicle are bigger and more numerous. Chad isn't the first place that comes to mind when well-off Westerners plan a safari to see some African wildlife. Those who've heard of this country that straddles the Sahara and central Africa, are more likely to think Boko Haram than luxury camp. Lake Chad, on the country's western borders with Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger, has been blighted by the Islamist group. But on this eastern side of Chad, high-end tourists are paying thousands of dollars a night to glamp out under canvas, watch the birds and the wildlife, and experience something exciting, different and adventurous. ""A typical park will cost African Parks anywhere between one and about $5m [£3.75m] per year just to keep going,"" says Peter Fearnhead. ""In order to be able to look after these parks, the resources needed - the costs of running parks and running them properly - are very, very high."" They are almost entirely donor-funded, with the European Union providing a huge chunk of the money. Attracting top-dollar tourists is the ultimate aim across all the places African Parks manages - so they can start paying for themselves. But those most at risk are often blighted by war, or instability. Even the Nomade wilderness camp at Zakouma - run during the four dry-season months of the year and booked up two years in advance - still pays only a third of its bills. The EU and philanthropists don't just give money to protect the animals, but because of the stability and the wider development a successfully run park can bring. Winning over the local community is the key to protecting it from poachers. Schools have been built, and jobs provided. Now, a network of radios has been given to villages outside the park to provide an early warning system for the rangers. ""When you have people coming out of Sudan - the same people that have committed the atrocities in a place like Darfur - when they come to poachin Zakouma, they're not coming along with their American Express and paying for accommodation and food along the way,"" says Mr Fearnhead. ""They rape, they pillage, they plunder and at the end of it they poach as well. ""We provide security to people living around the park. ""We have a common enemy, and by aligning ourselves with the local people, we are able to overcome those forces."" It's going so well that next year African Parks will be moving six black rhinos to Zakouma from South Africa, where poaching is destroying herds. The government of Chad is also happy with the arrangement. ""The number of animals is increasing and that's why we decided to sign a new agreement - it's a win-win result and we are very happy with it,"" says Ahmat Mbodou Mahamat, Chad's environment minister. African Parks has been asked to dramatically expand the area it manages at Zakouma and take over another park in Chad's north-eastern desert, where a rare species of crocodile is greatly endangered. ""We must understand that the biodiversity is not being preserved just because we want to look at the animals. An equilibrium of the ecosystem also provides a better life for humans,"" the minister adds. In the thick forest in southern Zakouma, the guards from Mamba Two patrol whispered for us to hang back and wait, as we were close to the herd. It was 11:00, with the Sun high and the temperature rising, and we were worried the elephants would be under the shade of the trees, scattered and out of view in the forest. But unexpectedly the landscape opened up into a wide green swathe of swampy grassland between strips of forest, and there they were - hundreds of them. Zakouma is home to one of the biggest single herds of elephants you can find anywhere in Africa. Some tore at the lush grass with their trunks and slapped at the water, others were sliding their huge frames into the mud and rolling on to their backs. The calves were having even more fun - one was perhaps just a month old. In 2013 there was only one elephant under the age of three in Zakouma, but now there are 85. With the wind at our faces and the animals unaware we were there, it was a magical experience. Six years after the park came under new management, the amount of wildlife has tripled, the elephant population is finally increasing, and the tourists are coming. ""It is a war against poachers, but poachers are obviously just the first step in a chain of resource utilisation and resource extraction that is a massive economic force across the continent and globally,"" says Peter Fearnhead. ""We can label the individual that might be pulling a trigger and shooting an elephant as the poacher, but ultimately you are waging a war against the illegal wildlife trade which is a key component of the greater economic scourges that we face as humanity on this planet.""","Prince Harry is the new president of a conservation group called African Parks, which takes over national parks and gives rangers military-style training to take on poachers and protect wildlife. The BBC visited one of the parks it manages, at Zakouma in Chad."
"Marcel Lazar, known online as ""Guccifer"", pleaded guilty in May on charges of aggravated identify theft and unauthorised access of a computer. Lazar, who targeted former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Bush family, was arrested on hacking charges in Romania in 2014 and given four years. He was extradited to the US to face charges in March 2016. The 44-year-old inadvertently uncovered Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's private email account in 2013 after hacking the account of her former political adviser, Sidney Blumenthal. Two years later, it was revealed that Mrs Clinton exclusively used her personal account, which was connected to a private server at her New York residence, while serving as secretary of state. Mrs Clinton's use of private email while at the State Department became the subject of an FBI investigation and has dogged her on the campaign trail. Earlier this year Lazar claimed he had hacked into her private server, but the Clinton campaign has denied there was any such breach. The FBI also has said there is no evidence to prove he had hacked her. Lazar, a former taxi driver in Romania, is believed to have hacked into about 100 US email accounts between 2012 and 2014. In June, a hacker who goes by the alias ""Guccifer 2.0"" claimed data breaches on the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. US intelligence officials have said they believe Guccifer 2.0 is linked to Russian intelligence services, suggesting that the hack was state-sponsored. There is no known connection between Lazar and Guccifer 2.0.",A Romanian hacker who targeted high-profile US politicians has been sentenced to 52 months in prison.
"But beyond the cuddly toys and red roses, the tradition draws mixed reactions around the world. From the hardline to the downright bizarre, here are just some of the ways Valentine's Day is embraced - or spurned like an unwanted lover... Indonesia's condom raids Authorities in some parts of Indonesia have banned students from celebrating Valentine's Day, saying it encourages casual sex. In the city of Makassar, police raided shops and dismantled condom displays. The mayor told the BBC that condoms were removed from sight after customers complained, but would still be sold discreetly. Valentine's Day has its roots in a Roman fertility celebration, but later evolved into a Christian feast day - a fact that worries conservatives in some Muslim-majority countries. In Indonesia's second-largest city, Surabaya, pupils were told to reject the festival as it runs against cultural norms. No emoticons for Malaysia :( Next door to Indonesia, Malaysia has also seen a Valentine's backlash. A group called the National Muslim Youth Association has urged women and girls to avoid using emoticons or overdoing the perfume, in a pre-Valentine's Day message. The group's guidance included advice on how to combat the celebration of romance by making anti-Valentine posters and shunning Valentine-themed outfits. Weddings on Robben Island Robben Island will forever be associated with the infamous prison that held Nelson Mandela - but since 2000, it has hosted a mass celebration of love on 14 February. The tradition was started by South Africa's Department of Home Affairs and the Robben Island Museum, and now attracts couples from across the globe. This year, 20 pairs are planning to say ""I do"" in the island's little white chapel. The service is offered for a small fee, and includes a tour of the island. Organisers say 2017's couples were ""chosen by the department based on their diversity and interesting romantic stories"". Thailand's 'very magical vitamins' Thailand's civil servants are handing out free pre-natal pills on the streets of Bangkok on Valentine's Day, hoping to boost the country's falling birth rate. Around 1 million baht ($28,600; £22,900) has been spent on the pills, for prospective mothers aged 20 to 34. The ""very magical vitamins"" (to use the government's words) contain folic acid and iron. In 1970, Thai couples had an average of six children, but the figure now stands at 1.6. Pakistan's court crackdown The High Court in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, has banned public celebrations of Valentine's Day, saying it is not part of Muslim culture. The festival has gained a foothold in recent years, but local critics say it is a decadent Western invention. The court order bans the media from covering Valentine's events, and bans festivities in public places and government offices. Saudi's black market in roses Saudi Arabia's religious police are on alert at this time of year for love-themed merchandise, including flowers, cards and suspicious ""red items"". Florists have been known to deliver bouquets in the middle of the night to avoid detection, as determined lovers flout the countrywide ban. A black market in roses and wrapping paper helps some broadcast their feelings. But for others, it's the perfect time of year for a romantic break - to nearby Bahrain or the UAE, where celebrations are more tolerated. Japan's anti-love protesters As Japan geared up for the 14th, a group of Marxist protesters unfurled a giant ""Smash Valentine's Day"" banner in Tokyo. The ""Kakuhido"", or Revolutionary Alliance of Men that Women find Unattractive, want an end to public displays of love that ""hurt their feelings"". Members have been known to chant slogans including ""public smooching is terrorism"". ""Our aim is to crush this love capitalism,"" said Takayuki Akimoto, the group's PR chief. ""People like us who don't seek value in love are being oppressed by society,"" he added. ""It's a conspiracy by people who think unattractive guys are inferior, or losers - like cuddling in public, it makes us feel bad. It's unforgivable!"" The protests came as Japan's family planning association revealed that ""sexless marriages"" in the country are at a record high. Nearly 50% of married Japanese couples had not had sex for more than a month and did not expect that to change in the near future, it said.","For the cynics among us, Valentine's Day is an annual nightmare: everything turns pink and heart-shaped, restaurants slap a premium price on a sub-par ""special menu"", and Hallmark shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank."
"Mrs Bush was the matriarch of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and her son George W Bush. She had been in failing health and had declined further medical treatment. Former President Bill Clinton called her a ""remarkable woman"" with ""grit and grace, brains and beauty"". Barack and Michelle Obama said she lived her life ""as a testament to the fact that public service is an important and noble calling"". The current Second Lady, Karen Pence, the partner of the vice president, described Mrs Bush as a ""trusted friend"" who had had a ""profound"" impact on her life. The current Education Secretary, Betsy De Vos, praised Mrs Bush for her efforts in improving literacy for all in the United States and around the world. JJ Watt, an American football player who came to know Barbara Bush as a result of her support for his team, the Houston Texans, said that she was a ""beautiful light in this world"". Mrs Bush's work also drew praise from her husband's former political opponents in the Democratic Party. The long-standing Democratic Senator for California, Diane Feinstein, praised Mrs Bush for her for making ""children's literacy a lifelong cause"". Elijah Cummings, a representative from Maryland, said ""[Mrs Bush's] goal to create opportunity through literacy touched lives all across the country"". The American news network NBC shared a famous video of Barbara Bush speaking at a commencement address at Wellesley College in 1990, saying that the president's spouse may one day be a man. But not everybody on social media praised Barbara Bush's legacy. Some commenting on the former First Lady's death recalled her controversial comments in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005. Whilst on a tour of a relocation site for those affected by the hurricane in Houston, Mrs Bush said that the victims were ""underprivileged anyway, so this is working very well for them."" The comic writer, Jennifer de Guzman, said that Mrs Bush's comments after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were ""disgusting and racist"".","Following the death of the former US first lady and literacy campaigner, Barbara Bush, tributes have come in from across US politics and society."
"Ms Rwigara was imprisoned for over a year, after being barred from running in presidential elections against the long-standing incumbent Paul Kagame. The 37-year-old opposition leader faced up to 22 years in prison for charges she said were politically motivated. A three-judge panel told a packed room all the charges were ""baseless"". Amnesty International welcomed the result, but said the mother and daughter ""should never have faced charges for expressing their views"". Since her arrest, Ms Rwigara's family have been subject to interrogations and their family assets forcibly auctioned. ""I am very happy with the verdict,"" said Ms Rwigara, who has been out on bail since October. ""I am continuing with my political journey... because there's still a lot that needs to be done in our country."" During the hearings, the businesswoman asserted that Rwanda's economy was mainly controlled by the governing party's elite. ""Everything I talked about in the past has not been resolved. There are still many political prisoners in the country,"" she told journalists after the high court ruling. Ms Rwigara has repeatedly accused President Kagame of stifling dissent and criticised his party's unyielding grip on power since it assumed control after the country's civil war. Dissent still not tolerated Anne Soy, BBC Africa correspondent The acquittal of Diane Rwigara and her mother Adeline could be seen a significant step in Rwanda's democracy. But it is also hard to ignore the fact that there was international pressure, including from the US Congress, to drop charges against her - not that Rwandan authorities are in the habit of listening to external voices. Critics still see Ms Rwigara's arrest and detention, and the auctioning of her assets, as a continuation of a trend of intimidation against anyone who opposes the government. And there's a long list of dissidents who have been punished severely. Opposition leader Victoire Ingabire was released from prison this year having served time for ""conspiracy against the country through terrorism and war"" and ""genocide denial."" She - just like Ms Rwigara - had intended to run for president against Paul Kagame, back in 2010. Another opposition leader, Boniface Twagirimana, went missing from prison in October. His whereabouts remain unknown. Ms Ingabire was released in September under the president's prerogative of mercy, a move that could be interpreted as painting Mr Kagame as the benevolent leader. But the underlying message remains that dissent will not be tolerated. In Thursday's ruling, the high court judges said the prosecution failed to prove that Ms Rwigara had personally forged supporters' signatures and ruled that her criticism of the government during press conferences was protected by freedom of speech in both the constitution and international law. They also ruled freedom of speech protected the Whatsapp voice notes Adeline Rwigara privately sent to relatives accusing the state of ruling through fear.","A Rwandan court in the capital, Kigali, has acquitted government critic Diane Rwigara and her mother of charges of inciting insurrection and forgery."
"Saad Hariri resigned as prime minister in October in response to mass protests over corruption and mismanagement. The Hezbollah movement and its allies chose university professor Hassan Diab to replace him last month, but they could not agree the cabinet's make-up. The matter became pressing after the protests recently took a violent turn. More than 460 people were injured in the capital, Beirut, over the weekend as security personnel fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets at demonstrators who threw stones, attempted to invade the parliament building, and vandalised ATMs, bank offices and shops. At least four young men reportedly suffered severe and irreversible damage to their eyes after being shot at close range with rubber bullets. Who is in the new cabinet? Mr Diab is a 60-year-old professor of computer engineering at the American University of Beirut and former education minister who describes himself as an unaffiliated technocrat. He was nominated to be prime minister - a post that must go to a Sunni Muslim under Lebanon's complex confessional power-sharing system - after Mr Hariri withdrew when other parties rejected his demand to lead a cabinet of specialists. Mr Diab's candidacy was backed by the biggest Shia Muslim factions, Hezbollah and Amal, and President Michel Aoun's Christian Free Patriotic Movement. Mr Hariri's Sunni-led Future Movement, the Christian Lebanese Forces party and the Progressive Socialist Party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt decided not to participate in the new government. After more than a month of negotiations over portfolios, Mr Diab announced on Tuesday night a cabinet of 20 ministers who he insisted had no political loyalties. Among them are Finance Minster Ghazi Wazni, an economist, and Foreign Minister Nassif Hitti, a former ambassador to the Arab League. There are six women in the cabinet, including Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Zeina Akar and Justice Minister Marie-Claude Najm. ""This is a government that represents the aspirations of the demonstrators who have been mobilised nationwide for more than three months,"" Mr Diab said. He promised it it would ""strive to meet their demands for an independent judiciary, for the recovery of embezzled funds, for the fight against illegal gains"". Mr Wazni said Lebanon needed foreign aid to save it, likening a looming debt crisis to an approaching ""fireball"". But analysts warned that the new government might struggle to drum up the support it needed to begin grappling with the economic crisis because it would not be seen as independent. ""The cabinet is composed primarily of advisers and appointees representing the main political oligarchs and parties allied with Hezbollah,"" wrote Paul Salem, president of the Middle East Institute. ""The cabinet includes a fair number of capable technocrats, but it does not have any political independence to speak of, and on all major matters will likely operate as a shadow government to the four or five men that still cling to power."" How did the protesters react? Thousands of people took to the streets of Beirut in the hours after the cabinet was announced, complaining that the ministers had been selected by the entrenched political elite that they blame for Lebanon's problems. ""We want a new Lebanon, a Lebanon with no corruption,"" Charbel Kahi, one of the protesters, told AFP news agency. ""They are not taking the Lebanese people seriously with this government."" Another protester, Wael Hassaniyeh, told Reuters: ""Just like we forced the previous government to step down because it did not meet the demands of the people, the same fate awaits this government, God willing."" Some people threw stones and fireworks at security forces deployed near parliament, prompting officers to fire tear gas and water cannon. Why have people been protesting? The demonstrations have been the largest seen in Lebanon in more than a decade. They have cut across sectarian lines - a rare phenomenon since the devastating 1975-1990 civil war ended - and involved people from all sectors of society. The protesters have demanded an overhaul of the political system, the formation of an independent, non-sectarian cabinet, and an end to government corruption. They also want urgent action to resolve Lebanon's economic crisis. The country's debt is equivalent to more than 150% of gross domestic product (GDP), its economy has stagnated, and the value of its currency, which was pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, has plummeted. The country's public infrastructure, which was already stretched before more than one million refugees arrived from neighbouring Syria, is also ailing. Electricity and water supplies are disrupted frequently and rubbish often piles up on the streets.","Lebanon has formed a new government, ending months of deadlock that have left the country adrift as an economic crisis deepens."
"""We all want a new India. I want to bow down my head and say thank you,"" he said in a victory address to supporters of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP is projected to get about 300 of the 543 seats in parliament. It is likely to take a larger share of the vote than in the 2014 elections. The main opposition alliance, which is headed by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, has admitted defeat. The general election was widely viewed as a referendum on the prime minister's Hindu nationalist politics, and the victory was won despite growing unemployment, fears of a recession and a slump in industrial production. What are the results so far? Partial and declared results show Mr Modi's BJP is projected to win 300 seats on its own, and combined with the party's allies, this number reaches nearly 350. The main opposition Congress party is expected to win fewer than 60. A party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. In 2014, the BJP won 282 seats - the biggest victory by any party in 30 years - and with its allies it secured 336 seats in that parliament. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat in 2014 and with its allies took up just 60 seats in the lower house. More than 600 million people voted in a marathon six-week process, which involved seven rounds of voting. What did Modi say? The 68-year-old prime minister was showered with rose petals by thousands of supporters as he arrived at the BJP headquarters on Thursday evening. ""This election was fought not by politicians but the people of this country - but it's the people of this country who have emerged victorious,"" Mr Modi told supporters in Delhi. ""We will never give up our ideals, our humility and our culture,"" he added. He said the victory was for the whole of the country, and vowed to build a ""strong and inclusive India"". Party members cheered, banged drums and set off fireworks when the results started to emerge. 'Keeping the nation secure' Narendra Modi made this an election all about himself. He should have faced some anti-incumbent feeling. Joblessness has risen to a record high, farm incomes have plummeted and industrial production has slumped. Many Indians were hit hard by the currency ban (also known as demonetisation), which was designed to flush out undeclared wealth, and there were complaints about what critics said was a poorly designed and complicated uniform sales tax. The results prove that people are not yet blaming Mr Modi for this. A combination of nationalist rhetoric, subtle religious polarisation and a slew of welfare programmes helped Mr Modi to coast to a second successive win. He also mined national security as a vote-getter in a manner never seen in a general election in recent history. ""It is all right if there's little development, but Modi is keeping the nation secure and keeping India's head high,"" a voter in the eastern city of Kolkata told me. Mr Modi is a strongman, and people possibly love him for that. What reaction has there been? At a press conference in Delhi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi conceded the general election as well as his Amethi seat in Uttar Pradesh, which he had held since 2004 and his family had held for decades. But he will still be in parliament as he contested and won another seat - Wayanad in Kerala. The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Delhi says Congress Party staff, who had been hoping for a much improved performance, looked lost for words. Messages of congratulation have been sent from a number of world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and China's President Xi Jinping. Where were the key contests? The BJP alliance has been projected to win more than 50% of the vote in the huge northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends more MPs to parliament than any other state (80). This took election observers by surprise as the party was expected to be seriously challenged by a tie-up between two powerful regional parties, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), which had previously been bitter rivals. The BJP is doing better than expected in West Bengal, where it is projected to take 17 parliamentary seats - up from two in the last polls. Four of India's five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala - have long eluded the BJP and appear to have done so again in this election. They look set to take just three of the 91 seats up for grabs. What challenges does Modi face? In his victory speech, Mr Modi said there were only two castes in India now. ""The poor and those who want to work to bring them out of poverty. We need to empower both."" Growing unemployment and fears of a recession will see Mr Modi face demands to provide jobs for the millions of young people entering the labour market in coming months. Under his first term, India's economy - the world's sixth largest - lost some of its momentum. A leaked government report this year put the unemployment rate at the highest it's been since the 1970s. Farmers in India will also be hoping he will prioritise the agricultural industry, after a crop glut and declining commodity prices saw their incomes stagnate. Many saw this election as a battle for India's identity and the protection of minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynching of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows. And national security was put into the spotlight after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting it to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of conflict.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thanked the people of India for giving him a ""historic mandate"" of five more years in office, after a landslide victory in the general election."

"An angry crowd set fire to his clinic near Mirpur Khas, Sindh province, and other Hindu-owned shops were looted. The vet said his use of the paper, apparently torn from an Islamic studies school textbook, was a mistake. If he is convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison. Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry harsh penalties for anyone who insults Islam. Critics say they target a disproportionate number of people from religious minorities. According to reports, the vet had used pages from the school textbook to wrap up medicines for a customer with sick livestock. But the customer saw Islamic religious content on the pages and went to a local cleric who informed police. Maulana Hafeez-ur-Rehman, a local leader of the religious political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islami, told BBC Urdu that the doctor had done it deliberately. According to police, the vet has insisted that his use of the paper was a mistake. He has since been charged with insulting religious beliefs and defiling the Koran and faces life in prison. Four shops, including the vet's clinic and a medical store, were ransacked and then set alight, local journalists reported. Mirpur Khas police officer Javed Iqbal told the BBC that those involved in the attacks would be arrested. He said they had ""neither love for Islam nor for their neighbours"". Islam is Pakistan's national religion and public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Correspondents say hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Hundreds of Pakistani citizens have been charged with blasphemy over the past few decades and some cases have triggered an international outcry. Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi was sentenced to death in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with her neighbours. She spent years on death row until her conviction was overturned in 2018 by the Supreme Court. She has since left the country.",A Hindu veterinary doctor in south-east Pakistan has been charged under the country's strict blasphemy laws after allegedly selling medicine wrapped in paper bearing Islamic religious text.
"Thousands of his supporters attended the event, despite a government warning that it amounted to treason. The authorities shut down TV stations to prevent live coverage of the event. President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November. He won an election re-run in October, but Mr Odinga boycotted it. Elections were first held in August but the courts ordered a re-run, saying Mr Kenyatta's victory was marred by irregularities. Holding a Bible in his right hand at a park in Nairobi, Mr Odinga declared that he was answering to a ""high[er] calling to assume the office of the people's president of the Republic of Kenya"". People had had enough of election rigging and the event was a step towards establishing a proper democracy in the East African state, Mr Odinga told a cheering crowd. Speaking earlier to Kenyan broadcaster KTN, Mr Odinga said his ""swearing-in"" was intended to ""show the world that what we are doing is legal, constitutional and not something you can remotely describe as a coup"". What did he achieve? It was a public relations stunt that ended in disappointment for many opposition supporters, says the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Nairobi. Mr Odinga turned up for just 20 minutes. He signed a statement, swore an oath and left the stage, leaving his supporters wondering why it was such a low-key affair, he adds. His deputy, Kalonzo Musyoka, was not at the event, and Mr Odinga said Mr Musyoka would be ""sworn-in"" at a later date. However, his absence suggested there were divisions in Mr Odinga's National Super Alliance, our correspondent says. What do Odinga supporters say? One of them, Larry Oyugi, said there was nothing illegal about Tuesday's event: ""We have warned the police enough and we are also going as per the constitution. The constitution of Kenya, article one, allows all Kenyans to exercise their power directly. ""This is why we are here to exercise our powers by gathering here and also article 37 allows peaceful assembly. We are citizens of this country, we are allowed to peacefully assemble here and elect our president as per the constitution."" Police allowed the event to take place, despite warning earlier that they would prevent it from going ahead. How did the TV ban take hold? Three privately owned television stations - NTV, KTN and Citizen TV - went off air from around 09:10 (06:10 GMT), BBC Monitoring reports. Citizen TV told the BBC the authorities had forced them off the air over plans to cover the gathering. It live streamed the event on its website, and on YouTube and Facebook. KTN viewers watched their screens fade to black as the news presenter read a statement confirming that the national communications authority was switching off transmission. Switching off the broadcasting signals of media organisations is unusual in Kenya, the BBC's Anne Soy reports from Nairobi. Threats have been made in the past and some media groups have been raided but none have had their signal deliberately disrupted. Kenyan journalists have denounced the move as outrageous and in a statement called for ""respect of the constitution"" and an end to the ""unprecedented intimidation of journalists"". There was tension in Kenya on Tuesday as some schools closed in the capital because of the event, and people did not know what to expect, our correspondent says. Why is the election result disputed? Mr Kenyatta was officially re-elected with 98% of the vote on 26 October but just under 39% of voters turned out. He was inaugurated in November. His victory is not recognised by Mr Odinga, who argues he was elected by a small section of the country. Mr Kenyatta also won the original election on 8 August but that result was annulled by the Supreme Court, which described it as ""neither transparent nor verifiable"". When the repeat vote was called, Mr Odinga urged his supporters to shun it because he said no reforms had been made to the electoral commission. Correspondents say the election dispute has left Kenya deeply divided. About 50 people are reported to have been killed in violence since the August ballot. 'Undermining authority' Analysis: Dickens Olewe, BBC News Mr Kenyatta will see Mr Odinga's action as undermining his authority, but it is unclear whether the government will risk plunging Kenya, East Africa's biggest economy, into a deeper crisis by arresting the opposition leader. Mr Odinga, on the other hand, will relish his self-declared honorific, ""people's president"". Other than that, it is unclear what he has gained from the ""swearing-in"". In fact, he seems to have been abandoned by other opposition leaders, who skipped his ""inauguration"". As for President Kenyatta, his legacy will be stained as a result of the media shutdown.","Kenya's main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, has declared himself the ""people's president"" at a controversial ""swearing-in"" ceremony in the capital."
"At least eight were killed and 11 seriously injured when the white pick-up truck mowed down people in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon. A 29-year-old man was shot by a police officer and arrested. Officials later said it was a terror attack. Mr Ogunniyi, who is 23 and a computer science student in the area, told the BBC what he saw. ""We were sitting outside of college, and I saw this truck coming, revving and swerving - he was going maybe 60 or 70 mph, in an area where the speed limit is 40 - it's a very congested area with lots of people. ""It hit the two people, I saw it hit them. Then he continued to drive down the walkway and bike lane. It hit a school bus and veered left. ""People started running towards the truck to see what was happening, and then the gun shots went off and everyone ran in the opposite direction. ""It was surreal, I was astonished - no-one really knew what it was, it looked at first like it could been an accident,"" he explained. People around him were confused and didn't know what they should do, he says. ""We didn't yet know that the people we saw hit were dead - we didn't know whether to call the authorities or emergency services, or whether we should be trying to seek shelter,"" he continued. He walked towards the partially-mangled school bus, which video taken by eyewitnesses appears to show came to a standstill nearby. ""We saw the fire department getting children off the bus, we saw them trying to take the bus apart to get inside - it was so bad. ""I'm not sure if the children were injured - maybe someone had got stuck. I'm not sure whether everyone was OK. ""Later we found out that more people had died than the two we saw in the street,"" he continued. He says the atmosphere in the area went from confusion and disbelief to shock that they witnessed the attack. ""It's just one of those things, you never expect it to happen. You see on the TV and news, you never think it could happen right in front of you, that it could be so close to you. ""We are just trying to work out why a person would want to mow down some people, to drive into a school bus. ""It doesn't really make sense, it's crazy. ""More so than anything, I remember seeing him driving, so recklessly, and revving the engine."" By Georgina Rannard, UGC & Social news","Babatunde Ogunniyi watched in disbelief as a truck revved and sped past him down a cycle path, hitting two people and crashing into a school bus."
"Three 15-year-old boys were rescued from rocks off Port Soif Bay after their kayaks overturned. While that rescue was in progress a visitor was rescued from the cliffs east of Saints Bay after he had got stuck while climbing up from the beach. All four of those involved were cold and shaken but otherwise uninjured. The emergencies were attended by the service's inshore lifeboat and cliff rescue team. Duty Officer Sonia Guille said in both cases a mobile phone played a vital part in alerting the emergency services. She said: ""The teenagers did the right thing and once the kayaks had overturned they went to the nearest rocks, climbed it and stayed on it. ""They had a phone on them so they could phone somebody. ""We advise people to carry their phone whenever they're going out.""",Guernsey's St John Ambulance and Rescue Service successfully dealt with two separate rescues at the same time on Sunday evening.
"The island is holding census day on Sunday 27 March, which is the same day as the UK one. The questions in the 2011 census will help Jersey's education authorities to work out how many pupils there will be in the future. They need to start making provisions a number of years before children arrive at schools. The census can also be a guide for where demand for school places will be, and can help to determine how many primary schools will be needed in the future. Jim Westwater, head of planning and projects at Education Sport and Culture, said: ""Accurate information is essential in forward planning and data from the census will help us to make informed decisions."" The 2011 census is the first for 10 years in Jersey; they were previously carried out every five years. The form is compulsory with a £1,000 fine possible for not completing it. The census asks islanders for all different types of information about their lives and will be used by policy-makers to help determine how services are used and whether they can be targeted better.",The census will be used to help the Jersey Education Department plan future class sizes.
"At least one person was treated in hospital and several were hurt as police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters in Siyazan. The demonstrators were angry at worsening economic conditions sparked by the fall in the price of oil. Azerbaijan's economy is heavily dependent on oil. Nearly half its GDP in 2014 came from the oil sector. Oil prices have slumped by 70% in the past 15 months, down to $31 a barrel on international markets. Azerbaijan's currency, the manat, has also fallen dramatically in value. The interior ministry said the protests were organised by the opposition and religious extremists. Price cut The government has ordered a cut in the price of flour in response to the crisis, effective from Friday, according to Reuters news agency. VAT was being waived on wheat imports and the sale of bread and flour, it said. In a further move to prop up the faltering manat, Azerbaijan's central bank has banned the sale of foreign exchange in bureaux de change run by commercial banks, Reuters adds. Analysis by BBC Azeri editor, Konul Khalilova Why are protests happening now? Azerbaijan's economy, heavily dependent on oil revenue, has been shaken by decreasing oil prices on the world markets. Small businesses have suffered enormously in recent years because of bribes allegedly demanded by officials. Corruption has been a major hurdle for businesses in Azerbaijan, according to the International Monetary Fund. Currency falls and price rises Azerbaijan's local currency, the manat, was almost equal to the euro at the start of last year but was devalued against the dollar in February 2015. In December 2015 the Central Bank unpegged the manat from the dollar, and an immediate price hike followed. This heavily affected low-income families. Many others with large bank loans suffered too. Azerbaijan imports even most of the basic consumer goods and, although some agricultural products are produced locally, raw materials for their production are brought in from abroad. What next? Despite recurrent warnings from international and local analysts about the expected effects of oil dependency, the Azerbaijani government has done very little to improve other industries. In a country where media are under strict control, critical voices are met with force. Discontent was relatively low during the oil boom, but now the volatile currency means that price increases affect almost everyone. And as the range of people who suffer increases, it may prove difficult for the government to appease the wider public.",Police have detained 55 people after protests over rising food prices in Azerbaijan.
"Peter Waggott, who taught at Les Chenes in the 1990s, said courts used the school to punish children too young for prison. They could spend months in a collection of cells, he said. The inquiry is investigating accusations of child abuse in Jersey's care system dating back to 1945. It has heard from a number of witnesses who said they were held in isolation for extended periods at Les Chenes, a remand centre for young offenders awaiting sentence. Part of the building was a collection of cells and a classroom known as the secure suite, the hearing was told. 'Locked up' Mr Waggott said staff had no choice but to comply with court orders which became more common by the year 2000. Children under 15 could not be given custodial sentences, but he said he ""had no doubt courts delayed sentencing to keep young offenders locked up."" He said he believed magistrate Ian Le Marquand - who later became Home Affairs Minister - introduced a court order which prevented some young people from leaving the secure suite. In the early 90s, he said the cells were so rarely used, one had an electric toy racing car track installed. But by the the year 2000, the cells were in heavy use, he said. Chief Minister Ian Gorst has set a deadline of December 2016 for the inquiry to conclude its investigations. The hearing continues.","Children were kept in isolation for extended periods at a Jersey secure school, an inquiry into historical abuse heard."
"By Tom BurridgeBBC News, Madrid Wording, however important, aside, Del Rio's release from a prison in Galicia this week, after serving 26 years for involvement in several bombings in the 1980s which killed a total of 24 people, has caused anger and disbelief, especially among government ministers and many of the families of Eta's more than 800 victims. But others believe the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights is a victory for the rule of law. Eta is all but finished, but its violent legacy still looms large over Spanish politics. 'Never forgive' On a Spanish early morning chat show this week, the voice of a 78-year-old woman, joining the programme on the telephone, echoed around the brightly lit, glitzy TV studio. Consuelo Fenollar spoke eloquently for five minutes uninterrupted, and emotion ran through her frail voice. ""I don't understand it… all this talk of human rights,"" she said in reference to the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights ruling that the convicted bomber Ines del Rio should be freed. ""All I ask is that if it's 40 years, they stay in prison for 40 years."" Her son, Gregorio Ordonez, a member of the centre-right Popular Party in the Basque country, was murdered by Eta in 1995. ""I will never forgive them. I'm left looking at photos all over the house, as if he's here."" The disgust of the relatives of people killed by Eta has reverberated throughout Spanish media. ""How can a woman, convicted of the deaths of 24 people, serve 26 years?"" some people have asked. Put simply, the answer, implicit in the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, is that anyone who commits a crime, including terrorism offences, should be punished in accordance with the law, at the time when the crime was committed. ""At the moment when they carried out these horrific attacks, they had the right to know the punishment that would apply,"" says Victor Moreno, president of the Spanish Union of Penal Lawyers. The European Court of Human Rights decided that a ruling by Spain's Supreme Court in 2006 could not be applied retrospectively. The 2006 ruling meant that the most serious criminals, serving sentences for multiple crimes, could not be eligible for early release. But the Strasbourg court said Ines Del Rio, convicted at the end of the 1980s, should have been set free in 2008 because under Spain's former penal code she had worked while in jail and reduced her maximum 30-year sentence to 21 years. 'Act of propaganda' The controversy surrounding the release of Eta prisoners has been a long time coming. Spain has no life sentence, and until 2003 the maximum jail term was 30 years. So, given that the majority of Eta's attacks were carried out between 1970 and 1985, some of the people convicted of those killings, who qualified for early release, began to be released from prison in the early 2000s. Public opinion in Spain at the time thought this was unjust. Lawyer Victor Moreno describes the 2006 ruling, designed to keep Eta prisoners behind bars until the end of their full sentence, as ""an act of propaganda to calm social alarm caused by the release of Eta prisoners"". He and other lawyers believe it is now ""inevitable"" that other convicted criminals, including dozens of members of Eta, could now be eligible for release, and that is causing further unease. Juan Moscoso, an opposition Socialist MP, believes the decision by the European Court of Human Rights, however difficult for the relatives of Eta's victims, is a ""victory for the rule of law"". ""The Eta that we suffered… no longer exists. It has been defeated. It will not return,"" said Spain's Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Díaz following the Strasbourg ruling. Eta called a permanent ceasefire in 2011 and over the past two years 58 alleged members of the group have been arrested. It's true therefore that Eta is increasingly weak and irrelevant in Spain today. That said, the case of Ines del Rio, and the likely release from prison of more members of Eta in the coming weeks, shows how the shadow of its past looms large over Spanish politics. Juan Moscoso and other politicians on the left of Spanish politics believe it is time to end the policy, under which the majority of the 600 or so Eta prisoners in Spain are kept in jails outside the Basque country and in many cases in faraway parts of Spain or in France. They think that if Eta prisoners were moved closer to their relatives, it's likely that the militant Basque group would disband and hand in whatever arms it still has. But the position of Spain's ruling Popular Party is unflinching. ""The prisons policy of the government is not going to change,"" said Spain's interior minister. The PP has always taken a very tough line over Eta. It is something its voters expect, and the PP-led Spanish government says it is not willing to negotiate with what it calls ""terrorists"" even though dozens more of them could soon be free to walk Spain's streets.","Ines del Rio was a leading member of the militant Basque separatist group Eta. In the eyes of most Spaniards she is a ""terrorist"", whereas her supporters controversially refer to her as a former ""political prisoner""."
"The lunchbox, stolen last week, was recovered along with a ruby and gold teacup, saucer and teaspoon. Two men from the southern city of Hyderabad have been arrested. The items, valued at $7m (£5.4m), once belonged to Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam (king) of Hyderabad and once the richest man in the world. Police allege the two men had fled to the western city of Mumbai in the hopes of finding a buyer for the stolen goods where they lived a ""fancy life"" in a five-star hotel for a few days. However, they were unable to find a buyer and returned to Hyderabad where they were arrested after a massive manhunt. Officers had initially struggled to identify the robbers because they had turned off all 32 CCTV camera's in the Nizam's palace. However, a camera near the palace captured the two men on a motorbike. Police say they found the motorbike a few days later and that helped them identify the pair. The recovered items will be handed over to the Nizam Museum, which opened to the public in 2000. Its collection comprises expensive gifts given to Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1937. Khan ruled what was then India's largest princely state. He died in 1967. His fabled wealth included the world-famous Jacob's Diamond - which was the size of an egg - and many other pieces of exquisite jewellery.","Thieves who stole a gold, diamond-studded lunchbox that belonged to a former royal family were using it to eat their meals, Indian police say."

"Séamus Lawless, 39, from Bray, County Wicklow, was part of a team of climbers who reached the peak on Thursday. His family have set up a GoFundMe page with the aim of raising £750,000 for the search effort. They say the company which provided an insurance policy to Mr Lawless is not assisting the rescue effort. As of Saturday morning, the page had raised more than €73,000 (£64,000). Mr Lawless went missing on Thursday. The search has since become a recovery operation, the company that organised the climb told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. He was taking part in the expedition to raise funds for the Barretstown children's charity. Mr Lawless is an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin. It has been reported that he went missing at an altitude of 8,300m (27,230ft), in an area known as ""the balcony"", near the mountain's summit. The family of Mr Lawless say the money being raised is for a team of expert Sherpas to help recover him. They add it was his ""lifelong dream"" to reach the peak of Mount Everest. 'Distressing time' Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits Treks which organised the trip, told RTÉ: ""It is a very difficult situation. We are searching for a body."" He said that conditions descending the mountain were ""very good"" but that Mr Lawless appears to have fallen accidentally. The GPS worn by Mr Lawless has been found almost 500m from where he fell, but experts have said it is possible the device became detached. Staff at Trinity College issued a statement expressing concern for their colleague. ""Séamus and his family are in our thoughts during this extremely distressing time,"" said a statement from the university. The university had earlier tweeted congratulations to Mr Lawless after he reached the peak of Everest on Thursday.",The family of an Irish climber missing on Mount Everest have launched a fundraising appeal to assist in the search for him.
"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter Earlier this week IS's last urban bastion in eastern Syria, Deir al-Zour, hard up against the Iraqi border, fell to Assad government forces. IS will remain in some form or another as an insurgency and source of ideological inspiration but as a territorial entity or physical caliphate, it is finished. But what of Syria's other war, the uprising against the Assad regime and its efforts - aided by Iran and Russia - to crush the opposition? The current situation on the ground means that forces from the above countries will be in close proximity to United States troops, who are supporting some of the anti-Assad groups. Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and professor at Oklahoma University, summed it up in simple terms. ""Assad has won the Syria war militarily,"" he told me. ""He has defeated the original uprising or revolution. The rebel groups that remain have been pushed to the margins of Syria. ""The international community has all but abandoned them as a lost cause. The rebel militias,"" he argues, ""still have some teeth in defence, but cannot mount a credible offensive against Assad's military."" Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, and another close watcher of Syria, has a slightly more cautious assessment. ""President Assad,"" he notes, ""sits more comfortably in Damascus than at any time since 2011."" But having said that, he argues that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest Assad had won the war. He's simply avoided losing it."" ""The Assad regime has a stated intent to recapture every inch of Syria. If that goal is to ever be met, we're talking years at least,"" he explained. But the crucial take-away from all this is that Syria is entering a new phase of conflict. The territorial defeat of IS, says Charles Lister, ""will throw an awful lot of potential sources of hostility up into the air and nobody really knows right now how they'll land"". What is emerging is a new strategic map with Syria divided into different zones: One controlled by the Assad regime (with the support of Russia and Iran), another controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (an amalgam of Kurdish, Arab and other groups supported by the US), and others run by various elements of the Syrian opposition, backed to varying degrees by Turkey and Jordan. Having helped Assad restore his control over a significant part of the Syrian population, Moscow has also manoeuvred itself into holding the best cards in the putative diplomatic end-game. As Joshua Landis told me, the Astana peace process, led by the Russians, ""is the only one worth anything at the moment. ""The Geneva process, led by the US,"" he notes, ""has been about grandstanding and sticking to talking points that no longer have any relevance on the ground, such as demanding that Assad step aside and that democratic elections be held in Syria. Everyone knows this will not happen."" With the demise of IS, Syria's future will continue to be determined by a variety of external players, fighting out their own strategic battles and seeking local advantage. The four key actors are the US, Russia, Turkey and Iran. Its initial half-hearted efforts to galvanise a democratic opposition to defeat the Syrian regime failed dramatically. Its focus has largely been on the defeat of the IS caliphate. But now, Joshua Landis says, Washington must make a decision: ""Will it stay in Northern Syria to defend the gains of the Syrian Democratic Forces that it has armed, trained and propelled to victory in Raqqa and the region north of the Euphrates River?"" The difficulty, as Charles Lister told me, is that ""beyond fighting IS, it is sadly very hard to determine whether the US really has a Syria policy."" And he says that what policy there is is full of contradictions. For example, Washington continues to say Assad must leave and that his days are numbered, and yet the US has ceased all support to anyone opposed to Assad. If US policy could be said to be in a mess, so too could that of Turkey. Ankara's goal, says Joshua Landis, is to retrench. ""It seriously overreached in Syria,"" he told me, ""almost to the point of destabilising Turkey."" He believes that President Erdogan ""must make sure that the Kurdish question in Turkey does not lurch toward civil war. He will increasingly normalise relations with Assad in order to contain the independence of Syria's Kurds."" Turkish troops have moved a small way into northern Syria to achieve this goal. Indeed, after posing as a champion of the opposition against the Assad regime, Charles Lister says, that ""at times, Turkey has directly betrayed the opposition groups it had stood by for so long, merely to secure a more favourable position against the Kurdish YPG, which it views as a terrorist organisation. In backing the Assad regime (and offering significant support to the Shia-dominated government in Iraq) Tehran has had one clear goal - to secure its hegemony in the northern Middle East: the lands stretching from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq, all the way to Iran's own borders. ""This,"" says Joshua Landis, ""is the new security architecture that Iran has fought so vigorously for and it is within its reach today. This means that Iran can counter-balance Israel. It means that Iran can establish oil pipelines running to the Mediterranean coast, trade routes, highways, and pilgrimage routes."" This, he says, means ""Iran is no longer cut out of the Middle East."" And Tehran has troops to back up its position. Charles Lister notes that Iran ""commands tens of thousands of Shia militiamen inside Syria, which gives Tehran more influence than any other actor, bar none."" Russia, after Iran, is the other great winner from the Syrian conflict, reviving its role in the region, securing important military bases, and making itself a key diplomatic player. It wants to ""solve"" Syria on its terms and with its favoured actors ending up the victors and it seems to be well on the way to achieving this goal. But the growing proximity of Russian and Iranian-backed pro-regime forces and those backed by the US raises the possibility of some dangerous encounters. The US and Russia can agree on the need to defeat IS but on little else. Moscow's ""side"" has the military and diplomatic advantage on the ground. Will the US seek to bolster its position in Syria, perhaps as part of a broader policy to ""roll back"" Iranian influence, as US conservatives are hoping? This may be easier said than done and might require many more resources and boots-on-the-ground than the Trump administration is prepared to put in harm's way.",Civil wars that spread devastation and suffering across a whole country have no real victors. But one war in Syria - that against the Islamic State (IS) group's so-called caliphate - is well on the way to being won.
"By Laurence PeterBBC News A Commission spokesman, Michele Cercone, said ""it's a national competence - the member states decide who is entitled to become a citizen"". On Tuesday Malta's parliament set a price tag for acquiring citizenship: 650,000 euros (£548,000; $873,000). Some other EU countries have also eased their citizenship rules. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Cercone said that owning an EU member state's passport ""immediately entitles citizens to European citizenship"", with all the rights covered by EU law. Malta, like most of the EU's 28 countries, is in the Schengen zone, where citizens can mostly travel without passport checks. EU single market rules have made it easier for EU citizens to travel to, and work in, another EU country. They also have access to the host country's public services such as schools and healthcare. Attracting the rich Malta has put a Jersey-based company, Henley and Partners, in charge of promoting Maltese citizenship, targeting wealthy foreigners. Citizenship will be granted to an applicant who deposits at least 650,000 euros in a new National Development Fund. Applicants will undergo strict vetting, ""thus ensuring only highly respectable clients will be admitted"", the company says on its website. If the applicant has a spouse or any child under 18, the dependents' citizenship fee will be 25,000 euros each. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the new citizenship scheme was likely to bring in about 30m euros annually. The scheme was attacked by the Maltese opposition, who said the tiny island state would become like a Caribbean offshore tax haven. Malta's population is 419,000. And a conservative German Euro MP, Inge Graessle of the Christian Democrats (CDU), said ""citizenship for money is cynical - this has nothing to do with European values"". Since the financial crisis rocked EU economies in 2008, many member states have offered incentives to attract investment by rich foreigners, including easier terms for residency and citizenship. Spain grants residence to foreigners who spend at least 500,000 euros on real estate or invest at least 2m euros in Spanish government bonds. Hungary grants residence to foreigners who invest at least 250,000 euros in government bonds. Hungary has also granted tens of thousands of passports to people in neighbouring countries, including Serbia, which is not in the EU. There are only two conditions - a direct ancestor who was a Hungarian citizen, and a basic knowledge of the language. Cyprus says foreigners who lost at least 3m euros in its banking crisis this year will be able to apply for citizenship. Most of those affected are Russians. Cyprus has also cut the amount of investment required to be eligible for citizenship, from 10m euros to 3m, in its existing ""citizenship by investment"" programme. British incentives The UK also offers a fast-track residence scheme for foreigners prepared to make a big investment. The UK has tough conditions for granting citizenship, including a citizenship test. But wealthy foreigners can settle permanently in the UK if they have been continuously resident for at least two years. ""Continuous residence"" means not spending more than six months outside the UK in any 12 consecutive months. The continuous residence requirement is two years for individuals who have at least £10m in personal wealth in the UK; three years for those with at least £5m in the UK and five years for those with at least £1m. A document on the EU's European Migration Network website, published in November 2012, says the Netherlands plans to give residence to foreigners with more than 1.25m euros in their bank account. ""The Netherlands received signals that in China there are a lot of wealthy people who want to get abroad and can 'buy' a residence permit for Canada, Singapore or the USA,"" it says. In 2011 the UK came top in the EU in terms of granting citizenship: 177,600 people became UK citizens, which is 22.7% of the EU total. The EU's statistics agency Eurostat says France was second, with 114,584 new French citizens, then Spain (114,599), then Germany (109,594). Eurostat says that, as in previous years, the largest groups of new citizens were Moroccans (64,200, or 8.2% of the total) and Turks (48,800, or 6.2%). Most of the Moroccans became French citizens, and most of the Turks became Germans.",The European Commission says it has no influence over EU countries offering inducements to non-EU nationals to take up residence or become citizens.
"The shooting took place on Friday night at an apartment complex in Bakersfield, the local sheriff's office says.

"George Papadopoulos, who served 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI during the Robert Mueller probe, is running for Katie Hill's California district. Ms Hill stepped down amid claims of an affair with a Capitol Hill aide. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his meetings with alleged Kremlin go-betweens. He filed his paperwork on Tuesday for California's 25th district with the Federal Election Commission. He tweeted this week that he was ""smelling blood in the water"" because of Ms Hill's resignation. His wife, Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, also tweeted a picture of her husband at a lectern, and she commented: ""Make California great again!"" Who is George Papadopoulos? Papadopoulos was the first former Trump aide arrested in the US Department of Justice investigation into an alleged Kremlin plot to sway the 2016 US vote. He was a London-based petroleum analyst before he joined President Donald Trump's election campaign in March 2016 as a volunteer foreign policy adviser. Papadopoulos soon made contact with a mysterious Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud. The professor told Papadopoulos the Russians had ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"". In the following months, thousands of emails linked to the Clinton campaign were published by Wikileaks. The young political operative told Mr Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, and other members of the campaign that he could set up a meeting with President Vladimir Putin ahead of the 2016 election. American authorities were alerted in mid-2016 after Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat during a drinking session in a London pub about his meetings with Professor Mifsud. Papadopoulos falsely claimed to the FBI he had met two individuals with Russian connections before working on the Trump campaign in March 2016. But in fact he had met them after joining the Trump campaign. Mr Trump's allies played down Papadopoulos' role, dismissing him as nothing more than a ""coffee boy"". Why did Katie Hill resign? Ms Hill said on Sunday she was stepping down with a ""broken heart"" even as she denied having an affair with her legislative director, which would violate House rules. The allegation triggered an investigation by the House of Representatives Ethics Committee. Ms Hill earlier admitted a three-way consensual romance with a female campaign staff member and her now-estranged husband. The relationship that Ms Hill acknowledged took place before she was elected, so it fell outside congressional rules on personal relationships. Nude photos of the congresswomen were published online. Ms Hill has accused her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, of trying to humiliate her. She wrote in her resignation statement: ""Having private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It's also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options."" Ms Hill's supporters have said she is being held to a different standard because she is a woman and bisexual. Another California member of Congress, Duncan Hunter, a Republican, has not resigned despite being indicted on charges of using campaign funds to pursue extramarital affairs with five women.",An ex-Trump adviser who sparked the US inquiry into Russian election meddling is running for a congressional seat vacated by a scandal-hit Democrat.
"Politicians, activists, business leaders and professors were reportedly among those being held in makeshift detention centres. The region has been in lockdown since Sunday night, with mobile, landline and internet networks cut off. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would address the nation on Thursday. Local police said the detentions were made in an effort to quell protests, Reuters news agency reported. ""There is a lot of anger among the people,"" a police official said. BBC reporters saw some protesters throwing stones at security forces, and spoke to residents who said they feared that the violence could increase. ""People of Kashmir are very angry,"" said Iqbal, a local travel agent. ""They are like a volcano that will eventually erupt and India is unaware of the consequences,"" he said. Among those detained were Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir - as the Indian state is known. Although both were able to circumvent internet restrictions and tweet soon after the announcement was made, they have not been heard from since. Article 370 - the constitutional provision guaranteeing special status - gave the state of Jammu and Kashmir special dispensation to make its own laws on everything apart from matters of foreign affairs, defence and communications. Mr Modi's speech, which will be broadcast via state radio at 20:00 local time (14:30 GMT), is expected to reach the Kashmiri people. But some critics say that his address has likely come too late for them. There is anger among Kashmiris that they have been ""muzzled"" since the government announced it would revoke the region's special status. Those who have been able to speak out have complained about the lack of discussion or consultation before the decision was taken. ""There had been no discussion about this move. No-one had expected it. We were shocked when we heard about it. Why would you take such a step in secret? Come out and tell us it's a good move"" one resident, Abdul Khali Najar, told the BBC on Tuesday. India's decision revoking Article 370 drew a swift reaction from Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan who said the move was in breach of international law. Mr Khan also announced a downgrading of ties with India. The Himalayan region is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, but each country controls only part of it. The United Nations called the latest restrictions imposed on the region ""deeply concerning"". Why is Kashmir controversial? Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan say is fully theirs. The area was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, but it joined India in 1947 when the sub-continent was divided up at the end of British rule. India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over it and each came to control different parts of the territory with a ceasefire line agreed. There has been violence in the Indian-administered side for 30 years due to a separatist insurgency against Indian rule. How has Kashmir's status changed? For many people in Indian-administered Kashmir, Article 370 was the main justification for being a part of India. By revoking it, the BJP-led government has significantly changed Delhi's relationship with the region. The article allowed the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir a certain amount of autonomy - its own constitution, a separate flag and the freedom to make laws, though foreign affairs, defence and communications remained with the central government. Under the article, Jammu and Kashmir could make its own rules relating to permanent residency, ownership of property and fundamental rights. It could also bar Indians from outside the state from purchasing property or settling there. The government said Article 370 needed to be scrapped to put the state on the same footing as the rest of India. But many Kashmiris believe that the BJP ultimately wants to change the demographic character of the Muslim-majority region by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there.","At least 300 people have been detained in Indian-administered Kashmir since the state was stripped of its special status, officials have said."
"Wa state is one of the most secretive places on earth. Search for it on Google Maps and you won't find it. Ask for a visa and you'll be denied. ""We thought everyone who wanted to visit were spies,"" one Wa official said. But times in Myanmar, and in Wa state, are changing. So for reasons that are still not entirely clear, the BBC was among a small group of international and local journalists invited for a first ever guided tour. Our entry was via a border post not far from Myanmar's north-eastern border with China. Having been thoroughly checked out by Burmese soldiers, we cross no-man's land and are warmly embraced by our minders from the local TV station, Wa TV. ""Welcome to Wa state,"" they beam at us as we are ushered into the back of waiting pickups. It is like a long awaited first date, and given the history of the Wa people we are just a little bit nervous. Back in British colonial times they were known as the ""Wild Wa"", famous for fighting ferociously and chopping the heads of their enemies off, before displaying them on poles. Awkward jokes about head-hunting out of the way, we travel south into rebel territory. Wa state is about the size of Wales, with a population of about half-a-million. It is really a state within a state, hugging the Chinese border. Its autonomous status dates back to a peace deal Wa rebels struck with central government in 1989. In return for stopping fighting, the rebels were given land to manage as they wished. So the Wa grew the most lucrative crop they could get their hands on - poppies. Over the next decade, Wa state and the Golden Triangle cemented its reputation as one of the world's leading producers of opium and heroin. The point of our carefully organised trip appears, at least in part, to show that the Wa have kicked their drug habit. So in our first few days we're taken to see some of the crops that have replaced the poppies. Tea, coffee and rubber. In Mong Mao, Wa's second town, a Taiwanese businessman comes to speak to us at the immaculately manicured oolong tea plantation he owns. He tells us that in common with almost everything that is made in Wa state, all his tea is sold to China. In fact, Wa state feels more like China than Myanmar. The money used is the Chinese yuan, the main language Mandarin, and infrastructure, like electricity and mobile phone networks, comes over the border from Chinese companies. ""I don't know what we get from being part of Myanmar"", Construction Minister Yeng Gar tells us with a loud laugh. ""But we don't want independence, we do want to be part of Myanmar."" It is a strategy that's worked well. The Wa have spent the last two decades astutely playing their two large neighbours off against each other. A well equipped rebel army keeps the Burmese military at arm's length, while close business ties with China have allowed the Wa to build infrastructure and prosper. We are shown roads and schools that would be the envy of other, more ""loyal"" Burmese states. But drugs are still a major issue. From what we can see, large-scale opium production has ceased, but the drug habit may have simply gone indoors. United Nations and US State Department reports accuse the Wa of becoming major manufacturers of methamphetamine pills, known locally as ""yaba"". Disappointingly, meth factories don't feature on our itinerary. But we do persuade our minders to let us speak to Justice Secretary Li San Lu. He is surprisingly candid, telling us that meth production is a huge problem, with two tonnes of pills having been seized this year alone. The blame, he says, lies with outsiders. ""We locals don't know how to make yaba,"" he says somewhat implausibly. ""The ingredients are all being brought in from China, India and Thailand and then manufactured here. We're the victims."" Before we could press him any further our minders stepped in and informed us that our reporting was over for the day. That night, feeling mutinous, we skipped the karaoke, side-stepped the minders and headed out for an unguided look around Panghsan, the state capital. It was soon clear that the Wa's taste for the illicit isn't limited to drugs. On almost every street was a shop selling the parts of endangered animals. Tiger teeth and skulls, elephant tusks and pangolin skins were all openly on sale. The women behind the counter tell us that most of their customers are Chinese and that delivery across the border can easily be arranged. Myanmar's most famous wildlife market, Mong La, is just 100km (62 miles) away, but what is striking about Panghsan is how organised and high-end it is. These shops are not market stalls, but supermarkets of endangered animals' parts. A previously undocumented gateway into the lucrative Chinese market. We film the shops discreetly with our mobile phones before showing the footage to Nick Cox from the World Wildlife Fund when we return to Yangon. ""It shows that there are more markets than we were previously aware of,"" he says. ""To see a market with such high-end stores selling highly finished products of critically endangered species show this problem isn't going anywhere. ""There is still a massive demand and people have a lot of money to spend on these products."" The Wa, for their part, do not see stopping the trade in animal parts as their problem. ""We don't have those sort of animals here, we cut down all our jungle for rubber plantations,"" Foreign Minister Zhao Guo An says. ""This is just free trade."" And that, to a certain extent sums up the Wa. Detached from both national and international laws, they do exactly as they please. And they do not want to change. Efforts to pull them into plans for a new more federal Myanmar have to date been a complete failure. Having been forced by the Chinese to attend talks, the Wa delegation walked out in a huff on day one, when they were given the wrong accreditation badges. The message was clear. The Wa are happy with the status quo and the freedom that comes with it.","The remote Wa region of Shan state in Myanmar's east is a place few outsiders have seen. The people who live in this unofficial, effectively autonomous state within Myanmar used to be called the Wild Wa, and as the BBC's Jonah Fisher found, drugs, money and the wildlife trade are flourishing."
"Thirty South Korean tourists and three tour guides, as well as two Hungarian crew, were on the tour boat when it collided with another vessel. The incident occurred just after 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Seven people have been rescued, and a massive search operation is continuing on a river swollen by heavy rainfall. The rain had led to strong currents on the Danube, and rescue teams say there is little hope of finding more survivors. It was not immediately clear which vessel was responsible for the collision, a rare incident on the Danube where navigation is busy but generally safe. A criminal investigation has been launched. What is known about the incident? The boat that sank near the parliament building in central Budapest was identified as the Hableany, or Mermaid. It has two decks and a capacity of 45 people for sightseeing trips. CCTV footage has emerged showing the 27-m (89-ft) Hableany and a larger tour boat, the 135-m Viking Sigyn, travelling in the same direction and colliding near the Margit (Margaret) Bridge. The boat sank within seven seconds after the collision, police spokesman Adrian Pal said. ""The whole thing happened very quickly"" Clay Findley, a US tourist who was on the Viking Sigyn, told the BBC. ""I thought at first we were going to miss it, but the front of the Viking hit the back of that little boat... and then the hull popped up on the opposite side of the ship, just a few seconds later, and then it was down,"" he added. Emergency crews discovered the wreckage of the Mermaid, built in 1949 in the former Soviet Union, on the riverbed near the Margaret Bridge and were preparing to lift it. Most of the South Korean tourists were aged between 40 and 50 but the group also included a six-year-old child and a man in his 70s, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The captain of the Swiss-registered Viking Sigyn was questioned on Wednesday night. What about the rescue operation? Seven survivors were taken to hospital with ""hypothermia and shock symptoms"", said Pal Gyorfi, a spokesman for Hungarian emergency services. A 31-year-old passenger, identified only by her surname Jung, told Yonhap: ""The current was so fast and people were floating away."" Another survivor, a 32-year-old woman named as Yoon, said she believed some 10 people who remained in the cabin had not been able to escape. ""The boat flipped instantly and capsized."" The rescue effort continued on Thursday with boats, divers, spotlights, and radar scanning along the river, where the temperature of the water was between 10C and 12C (50F-54F). But teams warned that, as more time passed, the strong currents would carry people further downstream, lessening the chances of finding survivors. The seven confirmed victims were not wearing life jackets and three of them were found several kilometres from the site of the collision, police said. 'An accident waiting to happen' By Nick Thorpe, BBC News, Budapest There has been a dramatic increase in river traffic in recent years as tourism increases in Budapest. Andras Kurbely, a crew member of another large cruise ship with 27 years of experience on the Danube, told the BBC that this was an accident he and others have long worried about. ""It's just not healthy to have so many large ships, which are much more powerful and harder to manoeuvre, carving a route between so many smaller boats."" In his view, the practice of the river cruisers, which sail up and down the river between the five main bridges as an after-dinner excursion for their passengers, should be stopped. How has South Korea reacted? The South Korean foreign ministry said officials would be sent to Hungary and counselling would be made available to victims' families. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his government planned ""to co-operate with the Hungarian government to thoroughly investigate the cause of the accident"". For South Koreans, the sinking is a painful reminder of the Sewol disaster in 2014, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul reports. The ferry of that name sank off South Korea's Jindo island, killing 304 people, almost all of them schoolchildren on a trip. The ship's captain was later convicted of murder.","Seven South Korean tourists have died and another 21 people are missing after a boat sank on the Danube river in Hungary's capital, Budapest."
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Comments from the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar justifying that decision have laid bare the gulf between the two sides. On Monday morning many people in the Republic of Ireland woke up saying they had a sleepless night. Just before going to bed they watched the RTÉ television news and learned from a leak the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) had recommended the country should move up several stages in its plan of living with Covid and move to a situation more or less close to the March and April lockdown, but with schools and crèches remaining open. It didn't take long for representatives of small businesses and politicians to vent their opposition. All Monday morning, there were private briefings that ministers in the three-party coalition government weren't impressed that they believed that a leak from NPHET was designed to bounce them into locking down the state. They had no idea that such a development was thought likely as there had been no indication from the public health officials that they were minded to impose further restrictions. Many politicians and their officials wondered whether NPHET's sudden advice was linked to the return of Dr Tony Holohan, who has widespread popular support, to the role of chief medical officer after a period off work taking care of his wife. On Monday night Mr Varadkar, who has a reputation for telling it as it is, went on RTÉ television and did not hold back. Mr Varadkar said the public health advice ""hadn't been thought through"" and ""came out of the blue"". No member of NPHET, he added, faced getting the pandemic unemployment payment or would have to tell someone they were losing their job. He said the government had to look at wider social issues such as the rate of unemployment, the tens of thousands of businesses that may never open again, social isolation and mental health issues. He continued that NPHET's assessment that hospitals were facing the immediate possibility of being overwhelmed wasn't shared by the Health Service Executive, the Republic of Ireland's equivalent of the NHS. He concluded by saying he had full confidence in the chief medical officer and in NPHET ""to dispense public health advice"". All Tuesday morning, government ministers have been telling reporters and presenters the public health officials were right to warn about the rising number of Covid-19 cases, but now was not the time to move to level five - the highest stage - of its plan. One further death was recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking the country's total number of deaths linked to coronavirus to 1,811. There were also 432 new confirmed cases and 150 people are currently in intensive care. Dr Holohan and NPHET have yet to give their reaction to the rejection of their recommendation and Mr Varadkar's comments. The main opposition party Sinn Féin with some reservation says it supports the decision not to go to level five but said Mr Varadkar's comments ""were a distraction"". The left-wing People Before Profit group is the only party to fully support the NPHET recommendation. In rejecting the advice from public health officials, ministers know they are taking a gamble. They have raised the level of restrictions and people are being asked: Whether that gamble pays off will be measured in the coming weeks in terms of new Covid-19 cases, deaths and the numbers in hospital and in intensive care. Much more than reputations are at stake. 'Major policing operation' Meanwhile gardaí (Irish police) have announced a major operation to encourage the public to comply with the new restrictions will begin at midnight on Tuesday. Operation Fanacht was first introduced in the run up to the Easter holidays and again during bank holiday weekends over the summer. Commissioner Drew Harris said ""travelling by road from tomorrow will be different from travelling today"". He said: ""An Garda Síochána's priority is keeping people safe. This will be a major policing operation across the country with high visibility of Garda members to support public health measures."" People should not leave their county, he added, except for ""essential purposes"". About 130 checkpoints will be in place on the country's main arterial routes while the operation will also include the deployment of thousands of mobile checkpoints.","For the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the Irish government has rejected advice from its public health officials about the necessary level of restrictions because of the rising number of new cases."
"By Tim FranksPresenter, News Hour Above his jaundiced, swollen belly, his thin chest is pumping fast. His face twists into the pillow. An oxygen mask is strapped tight across his mouth and nose. Santiago is two years old and has acute myeloid leukaemia. What he does not have is adequate treatment. Inside his cramped room, on the 10th floor of the University Hospital of Caracas, his doctor, paediatric resident Joam Andrade, points to the cockroaches on the walls, and the sticky tape holding his oxygen tube together. But those are details. Santiago lacks medicine. ""This is the third time since last year that he's relapsed and we've had to admit him,"" Dr Andrade says. ""All we can do is try to control the pain."" She writes in my notebook what she wants to prescribe, and cannot, because there is none in Venezuela: ""Cladribine. 5-6 ampoules. 10mg."" Worst in the world Plenty of countries have damaged or failing health systems. Few are like the Venezuelan. This country, which holds parliamentary elections on Sunday, has oil reserves exceeding Saudi Arabia's. That natural wealth provided hundreds of billions of dollars of export earnings for Hugo Chavez, the man who, for 14 years until his death in 2013, ushered in and then presided over a radical left Bolivarian Republic. Under his successor, Nicolas Maduro's rule, though, the oil price has cratered. The IMF forecasts the country's economy will contract 10% this year, 6% next. Those are the worst figures in the world, excluding Syria, and there's no data for Syria. Actually, there's no official data from within Venezuela, because the Central Bank has stopped reporting its own economic figures. So we have to rely on the IMF's estimate that inflation in Venezuela will be 159% this year and 204% next year. They are also the worst figures in the world. And most Venezuelans will tell you they're a woeful underestimate. It was against this wreckage, in a bare hospital lecture-room, that Dr Andrade joined a group of doctors, students and heads of department to talk to me about the state of the hospital. I had asked to speak to one or two. Over the course of an hour, more than 15 - I lost count - walked in, off shifts, off ward-rounds. They waited their turns and then listed their woes. No syringes. No operating equipment. Violence from patients' relatives, furious that the hospital management had assured them of high quality care. The paediatric emergency department closed for repair; the temporary site had, one student doctor told me, ""no oxygen, no medicine for asthma, no antibiotics, no food"". Opposition poll lead The hospital administration declined to comment. But the government insists it still has a good story to tell. Ernesto Villegas has just stepped down from two years as a minister, in order to compete in the elections as a candidate for the governing Chavista PSUV. It is, perhaps, a brave move, given the wide lead opinion polls are giving the opposition coalition. Venezuela's woes Former bus driver Nicolas Maduro won a disputed election in 2013 to succeed his mentor Hugo Chavez. His poll ratings have slumped amid falling oil prices and accusations of mismanaging the economy. Venezuela depends on oil for 96% of its foreign currency export earnings; the collapse in prices has severely limited the country's ability to pay for imports, causing shortages of basic household goods. Unlike some other mineral rich states, Venezuela had no ""rainy day"" fund or contingency plan for falls in export income. Mr Maduro has accused foreign powers and speculators of waging ""economic war"" on Venezuela and said his policies are aimed at defending the spending power of ordinary Venezuelans. The Organisation of American States (OAS) has expressed concern about the jailing or barring from the election of a number of opposition political figures. Despite these setbacks, polls suggest the opposition could this month gain its first majority in the National Assembly for 16 years. Seated against the railing of a park overlooking one of Caracas's working-class barrios, Mr Villegas, wearing a party-embossed blue shirt, said ""perhaps in that hospital there are issues"". But the bigger point, he said, was the vast improvement in primary health care, particularly for the poorer sectors, such as the ""23 de Enero"" barrio, which loomed over his shoulder. ""Today, thousands, millions of Venezuelans get healthcare, can exercise their right to healthcare."" But community health centres are no help, right now, for Yixember Cohen. The 30-year-old graphic designer is standing by his bed in University Hospital. His eyes are bright, his tattoos plentiful. Mr Cohen has Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that means his aorta is dilating dangerously. With a smile that's polite, apologetic and entirely incongruous, he explains his prognosis: ""In my case, it's just a timebomb. If I'm not treated, my heart will explode. Pow! Plop!"" This bomb could be defused easily enough through surgery, and the use of a replacement, mechanical valve. But one of his doctors, who asked not to be identified, said that in Mr Cohen's case, the surgeon could not operate without a complete set of valves, as he could not tell what size he would need. ""It's routine equipment. We've always had it,"" he told me, a few metres away from his patient. ""But we haven't had a complete set for more than a year. I don't know when we'll be able to import any more. Management says the end of the year. I'm not sure I believe them."" Mr Cohen smiles warmly as we leave. ""You have to remain strong when your life is on a knife-edge,"" he says. ""And, in any case, it's not good for my heart, if I get upset."" 'Not fair' In contrast, Dr Ivan Machado says he ""will not stay calm"". He has been treating patients at University Hospital for 35 years and is now head of cardiology and director of the medical school. His salary is about 20,000 bolivars a month. To put that in context, according to the independent Venezuela-based research centre Cenda, the basic goods an average person needs for a month cost 100,000 bolivars. But that is information Dr Machado imparts just as an aside. What matters to him is that his department has not been able to perform a single heart surgery in the past three weeks. ""We have gone from 450 open heart surgeries a year to 20. And from 1,200 cardiac catheterisations per year, it's now at most 300. ""I'm almost at the point where I have to say we need to close our department of cardiology, because it's not fair to make us just look at our patients, and see which way they are going to die."" He and his colleagues have looked for answers. The BBC has seen a letter sent in June, by Dr Machado and other heads of medical departments to the government ombudsman explaining the depth of the crisis and suggesting ""concrete steps"". They have received no reply. The same has gone for a second letter, sent at the end of October, to the head of the University Hospital, about Dr Machado's inability to treat the 468-long waiting list of cardiac patients. Again, no reply, no acknowledgment. Dr Machado looks out at the roomful of junior doctors before him. Several of them are in tears. ""We are in a humanitarian crisis,"" he tells me. ""Our country may be wealthy, but it is poor.""","Santiago Ortiz is lying, eyes closed, on the bed. He is no picture of repose."
The report was written after the death of a 75-year old man following a routine operation. Joseph Vasse developed an infection and died of multiple organ failure. Deputy Anne Pryke said she and others were working hard to release the report after calls from Mr Vasse's family and their lawyers. She hopes to have it available within the next week.,A report on the standards of care at Jersey's General Hospital should be released next week according to the health minister.
"Hundreds have marched in the Missouri city for a second day, chanting ""Black lives matter!"" More than 33 protesters were arrested and 11 police officers were injured in Friday night's scuffles. The defendant, Jason Stockley, 36, was cleared on Friday of murdering Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. Mr Stockley, a serving police officer at the time, was recorded saying ""Gonna kill this [expletive], don't you know it"" while in a car chase after Mr Smith. On Saturday evening, police were out in force as demonstrators rallied in St Louis. Crowds marched through a shopping centre in the Delmar Loop suburb, blocking one major road. Police said that after dark, ""the unruly crowd became a mob"" and some people caused damage to property including windows of local businesses and police cars. A local newspaper reported that some protesters threw rocks, bottles and rubbish bin lids. Friday's disturbances began in the afternoon as protesters took to the streets after the court verdict. The home of St Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson suffered considerable damage, police say, as protesters ignored orders to disperse. By late evening police declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly"". As a result of the protests, a concert by the Irish rock band U2 due to take place in St Louis on Saturday night was cancelled. The concert's organisers say they took the decision after police informed them that they were ""not in a position to provide the standard protection for our audience"". Mr Smith was a new father and engaged to be married when he was killed on 20 December 2011. Mr Stockley and his partner said they believed they had observed Mr Smith engaging in a drug deal outside a restaurant. Police dashcam video and surveillance footage showed Mr Smith reversing his car into the police vehicle twice during his attempt to drive off. After a three-minute high-speed chase, Mr Stockley told his partner, who was in the driver's seat, to ram Mr Smith's car. Mr Stockley then ran to Mr Smith's window and fired five shots, hitting him each time.","New protests have broken out in the US city of St Louis, where a white former policeman was found not guilty of murdering a black suspect in 2011."
"The company claimed it had ""no other choice"" as three weeks of negotiation led to no offers of short-term support from the Government of Jersey. The government said it was considering ""all steps available"" to see the company ""acts appropriately"". Jersey Gas serves 70% of the island's hospitality industry, which has been forced to shut during the lockdown. The forced closure of its main commercial customers have had a ""severe negative impact"" on usage, Jersey Gas said. The impact of these losses were threatening the ""safe and secure"" supply of gas to both private households and businesses, the private utility added. The price hike will begin from 1 May. 'Particularly insensitive' Managing director Ian Plenderlith said: ""We understand the financial challenges many of our personal and commercial customers will be facing at the moment, and we are very sensitive to adding additional financial burden at a time like this, but we have simply been left with no other choice."" The government said no support had been given because Jersey Gas had not supplied ""vital financial information on their business and their parent company"", despite multiple requests. Minister for Economic Development Lyndon Farnham said an ""increase of this magnitude"" was ""particularly insensitive"" at this time. Senator Farnham said: ""[I] will consider all steps available to government - including those provided for under the Jersey Gas Company (Jersey) Law 1989 - to see that Jersey Gas acts appropriately."" Under the law the government can set the firm's tariffs and buy out the company as long as 12 months' notice is given.","Gas prices in Jersey will temporarily rise by 6.5% to offset the cost of the coronavirus pandemic, Jersey Gas said."
"The unnamed US officials said that Russia had deployed a banned cruise missile. A Kremlin spokesperson said on Wednesday that Russia continued to uphold its international commitments. The US state department has made no official comment. The alleged deployment is expected to be discussed during Wednesday's Nato meeting in Brussels, the first since President Trump took office. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he would not comment on intelligence reports but added that any non-compliance from Russia on the arms control treaty would be a ""serious concern for the alliance"". The Brussels meeting will be attended by US Defence Secretary James Mattis. ""Nobody has formally accused Russia of violating the treaty,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a press briefing. ""Russia has been and remains committed to its international commitments, including to the treaty in question,"" he said. A New York Times report, citing administration officials, said that the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. Republican Senator John McCain responded to the missile allegation with a statement calling on the Trump administration to enhance US nuclear deterrents in Europe. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""testing"" Mr Trump. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) was first signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987. It bans the use of ground-based, intermediate-range or short-range missiles by Russia or the US. Russia has been accused of violating the treaty before, including under the Obama administration. In 2014, the US accused the Russians of developing and testing cruise missiles. Mr Putin has also previously said that the treaty no longer serves Russia's interests, and it is unfair as it does not apply to other countries that have since developed missiles within the same range. The US relationship with Russia remains under intense scrutiny, after General Michael Flynn resigned as the president's national security adviser on Tuesday. Mr Flynn quit on Monday over claims he discussed US sanctions with Russia before Donald Trump took office. Private citizens are not allowed to conduct US diplomacy.","Russia has denied violating a Cold War-era missiles treaty, following accusations by officials in US President Donald Trump's administration."
"The encounter is thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and a member of Donald Trump's inner circle. A special prosecutor is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with alleged Russian efforts to influence last November's US election. Both Mr Trump Jr and the lawyer say the campaign was not discussed. Mr Trump Jr was accompanied by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign head Paul J Manafort, meeting Natalia Veselnitskaya at New York's Trump Tower on 9 June, two weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. Mr Trump Jr said in a statement that they discussed a suspended programme for Americans to adopt Russian children. He said it ""was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up"". Mr Kushner's lawyer said he had previously disclosed the meeting on security clearance forms. President Vladimir Putin suspended the adoption programme in 2012 after the US Congress voted in a law to allow the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations. Ms Veselnitskaya, who played a key role campaigning against the law, said ""nothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign. ""I have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government."" Last week Mr Trump said interference in the election ""could well have been"" carried out by countries other than Russia and interference ""has been happening for a long time"".","The US president's son, Donald Trump Jr, has admitted meeting a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer last year."
"On Saturday, Yemeni officials said about 100 US troops were leaving an air base near a southern city that was stormed by al-Qaeda fighters on Friday. There has been mounting violence by rival armed groups in Yemen, including Houthi rebels, al-Qaeda and IS. The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting on Yemen on Sunday. It was requested by Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who fled to the southern port city of Aden after the capital was taken over by Houthis last month. In a letter sent to the UN, President Hadi called for an ""urgent intervention"" to stop the aggression ""that is aimed at undermining the legitimate authority"", according to Reuters news agency. 'No military solution' Late on Saturday, US state department spokesman Jeff Rathke said: ""Due to the deteriorating security situation in Yemen, the US government has temporarily relocated its remaining personnel out of Yemen."" He said the US would continue to support Yemen's ""political transition"" and monitor terrorist threats emanating from the country. but he added: ""There is no military solution to Yemen's current crisis."" The US withdrawal from the al-Anad air base comes after an offensive by al-Qaeda fighters on the nearby city of al-Houta. The militants were later pushed out of the city by Yemen's armed forces, officials said. The US military personnel at the base, including some special forces, had been training Yemeni fighters to support their fight against al-Qaeda. The US closed its embassy in Sanaa in February after Houthi rebels took over the city. On Friday, President Hadi demanded that the rebels withdraw from Sanaa in his first televised address since fleeing the city. Soon after Mr Hadi spoke, the Houthis called for a general mobilisation of their forces against those loyal to the president. Yemen is the base of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a powerful offshoot of the jihadist group. However, IS is also gaining ground after setting up a base there in November. The group claimed a suicide attack on two Houthi mosques on Friday in the capital, Sanaa. Both al-Qaeda and IS are Sunni groups and consider the Shia Muslim Houthis to be heretics.","The United States has evacuated its remaining military personnel from Yemen because of the deteriorating security situation, US officials have confirmed."
"Cartels are influencing elections by threatening politicians and even running their own candidates, OAS Secretary for Multidimensional Security Adam Blackwell said. He was speaking at an OAS conference on transnational crime in Mexico City. The two-day meeting brings together prosecutors from across Latin America. Mexican President Felipe Calderon told delegates that countries in the Americas needed to work together to defeat gangs. ""In the face of transnational organised crime, we must create an international front where societies and governments are not faced with resolving this challenge alone,"" he said. Mr Calderon has made the fight against Mexico's drugs cartels the central policy of his presidency. More than 45,000 Mexicans have died in drug-related violence since 2006, when he began deploying the military to combat the cartels. The flow of South American cocaine north to the US has also helped turn Central America into one of the most violent regions in the world, with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador particularly affected. ""Crime and violence are today the biggest threat to security in our region,"" Mr Blackwell said. ""The participation of criminal bands in the election process is another expression of the risks that organised crime poses to the preservation of our democratic organisations,"" he added. Throughout Americas, Mr Blackwell said there had been 150,000 homicides in 2010. Officials at the meeting also expressed optimism that, through co-ordinated action, criminal gangs could be successfully confronted.","Drugs gangs are posing a growing threat to democracy in Latin America, the Organization of American States (OAS) has warned."
"By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Tokyo In the 1960s and 70s, the spirits of scores of convicted Japanese war criminals were ""enshrined"" there. The most controversial were the 14 ""Class A"" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were ""enshrined"" in the late 1970s. These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia. It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians. 'Tough guy' So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go? Firstly, because he wanted to. Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist. He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were ""victors' justice"". His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge. But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away. Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is ""showing he is a tough guy"", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base. 'Shrewd political calculus' But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind. He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution. This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s. Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated ""peace constitution"". Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation. It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of ""universal values"". Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this. But it will be very hard. And so he will need some help. ""Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,"" says Prof Kingston. ""There is a shrewd political calculus at work here."" What he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.","Whatever Shinzo Abe says, any visit to the Yasakuni shrine by a Japanese prime minister is deeply political and sure to cause offence."
"More than 90 police officers have been killed in the city since the beginning of the year, many by a criminal gang calling itself First Command of the Capital. Among the measures introduced are a new police agency, and the transfer of prisoners to more secure jails. Police say jailed gang members plan many attacks from inside their cells. Behind bars Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo announced the creation of a joint intelligence centre which will co-ordinate the work of state and federal security forces. Despite the sharp rise in violence in the greater Sao Paulo area, the government ruled out deploying the military to the most violent neighbourhoods. Mr Cardozo said Sao Paulo's 160,000 police officers would be enough to combat organised crime. Under the new plan, security and surveillance will be stepped up at ports, airports and major highways, which are used to smuggle drugs into Sao Paulo. Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin said inmates who were suspected of ordering attacks on police officers would be moved to maximum security prisons under federal control, from where they would be unable to communicate with their hit men. It is not the first time the federal authorities have tried to break up the prison gangs by moving them to different jails. In 2006, members of the First Command of the Capital gang unleashed a wave of violence and riots in almost all of Sao Paulo's prisons to prevent being transferred.","A new plan has been unveiled to combat rising violence in Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo."
"Ms Zia, a former prime minister, denies misusing international funds donated to a charitable children's trust. The jail sentence may mean the 72-year-old is barred from parliamentary polls due later this year. The case is one of dozens pending against Ms Zia, a long-time rival of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Ms Zia has described the charges against her as politically motivated. As she went into court, she told weeping relatives: ""I will be back. Do not worry and be strong"", according to the Daily Star. The verdict was read out in a court in Dhaka after police used tear gas to disperse thousands of her supporters. Several police officers were injured in the violence, reports said. Ms Zia was led away to jail minutes after the verdict, bdnews24 reported. Her son Tarique Rahman was given 10 years in jail in absentia as he is in London. The same jail term was handed down to four of her aides. The trial against Ms Zia centred around $252,000 (£182,000) intended for an orphanage trust set up when she was prime minister. She was found guilty of embezzling the funds. Who is Khaleda Zia? By BBC Monitoring The charges against her had already led to her boycotting elections in 2014, which triggered widespread protests at the time. For Thursday's verdict there was heightened security across the capital and other cities. Many shops and schools were shut, reports said. According to Ms Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), hundreds of its supporters were arrested in the run-up to the verdict.","Bangladeshi police have clashed with thousands of protesters, as opposition leader Khaleda Zia was jailed for five years for corruption."
"Mark MardellNorth America editor@BBCMarkMardellon Twitter In Through the Looking Glass, Humpty tells Alice: ""When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less."" The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, doesn't have that luxury. If he called the Egyptian military's intervention in the democratic process a ""coup"", it would clearly mean the huge amount of aid the US gives to Egypt would have to be cut off. Because that's what it says, in black and white, in the US Code: ""None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act shall be obligated or expended to finance directly any assistance to any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree."" And it is not a few cents here and there - the president's plans are to give $1.5bn (£1bn) next year. There is also a suggestion that cutting the money would hurt US arms manufacturers. So instead, Mr Carney talks of Mohammed Morsi's ""removal"" from office, saying it would not be in the US interest to cut off aid: ""This is a complex and difficult issue with significant consequences."" Are they listening? There will be a review and the cash could still be pulled. The president himself has not ventured an opinion. But Senator John McCain has declared that aid should be stopped, despite his misgivings about Mr Morsi. ""It is difficult for me to conclude that what happened was anything other than a coup in which the military played a decisive role,"" he said. ""I do not want to suspend our critical assistance to Egypt, but I believe that is the right thing to do at this time."" It may be that President Obama is weighing which of his options give him the most clout with the Egyptian military. But it is not clear they are listening. The one consistent call from the White House has been for an end to the violence. Monday's events in Cairo, whomever you believe, do not fit that bill. The trouble is that the White House looks powerless, when it obviously has a great deal of power and, quite literally, investment in Egypt. In the end, Mr Obama's passivity may turn out to be level-headed diplomacy. But it looks bad to those who accuse him of prevaricating. It doesn't feel like leadership, and the number of harsh judgments on his foreign policy is growing.",Here are a couple of riddles for you: When is a coup not a coup?

"Jon SopelNorth America editor@bbcjonsopelon Twitter I wonder whether they had an instrument that measured enormous sighs of relief in Brooklyn, home of the Hillary Clinton campaign, as Joe Biden bade farewell to his presidential ambitions. The mass exhalation of breath of all the Clintonistas must have been quite something. After her rock-solid and statesmanlike performance in the Democratic debate in Las Vegas last week, Clinton's poll position has been consolidated. The only pesky cloud on the horizon was Joe Biden. For all those people who don't quite like Clinton - and you don't have to scratch the surface very hard to find huge numbers of these people - but couldn't bring themselves to vote for the self-styled democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, then the entry of Biden into the race could have shaken things up quite considerably. For a start it would have given Barack Obama a knotty little problem of whom to support. The superbly well-qualified Clinton, or lovable and loyal Biden. It could have certainly taken vital funding away from Clinton towards his camp. Let's take Biden at his word this was all about whether the time he needed to grieve his son Beau would forbid a tilt at the White House. But certainly his supporters and closest advisers were scoping a run - what they would need to do to put an infrastructure in place, whether the ""bundlers"" would be able to raise the money to mount a well-financed campaign. If it was a clear cut decision for either Biden or his most senior aides, we would have heard before now what his intentions were. So what are we left with from today's Rose Garden address? Let's play the fun political game of here's what he said, and here's what he meant. First what he said: ""I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.... I believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we're now on the cusp of resurgence. I'm proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy. The American people have worked too hard, and we have have come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record. They should run on the record."" Let's put that through the politico-translator app. What comes out? Hillary, if you want me to back you don't go around trash-talking the president's record. He did great things. You were part of it and you agreed with it, so don't go dissing him otherwise you'll have me to contend with. Then there's this passage: ""I believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart. And I think we can. It's mean spirited, it's petty, and it's gone on for much too long. I don't believe, like some do, that it's naive to talk to Republicans. I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition."" Translation? Clinton- enough already with the 'Republicans are our enemies'. If you win you're going to have to govern with them, so stop being so bloody divisive. (I think this must be an app from the UK). And then I put this final phrase in: ""I am absolutely certain that we fully are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things. We can do this. And when we do, America won't just win the future, we will own the finish line."" I had to translate this a couple of times because it didn't seem to bear much relationship to what I had typed in. It came out as - I might not be running, but I would have been a great president. But that's not going to happen now - and there is not much left in the road to trip Clinton up - just some Sanders-shaped bumps in her way. Given the troubled and maladroit way the email saga has been handled that can't be entirely ruled out. And if something did go horribly wrong with Clinton's campaign - wouldn't the Democratic Party turn to the vice-president in its moment of need, saying: ""Come on Joe"". And he would say ""You bet"".

"The frontman's brooding charisma - added to the group's blend of rap, metal and electronic music - spawned a string of chart-topping hits. The son of a police officer in Phoenix, Arizona, Bennington was born on 20 March 1976 and had a troubled youth. After years of intense drug use, he got sober and joined Linkin Park in 1998. ""Growing up, for me, was very scary and very lonely,"" he told Metal Hammer magazine in 2014. ""I started getting molested when I was about seven or eight,"" he said, describing the abuser as an older friend. ""I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didn't want to do. ""It destroyed my self-confidence. Like most people, I was too afraid to say anything. ""I didn't want people to think I was gay or that I was lying. It was a horrible experience,"" he told the magazine. His parents divorced when he was 11 years old, and he went to live with his father, whom he described as ""not emotionally very stable then"", adding that ""there was no-one I could turn to"". The singer quit hard drugs after a gang broke into a property where the future star was getting high and pistol-whipped some of his friends. Bennington moved to Los Angeles and successfully auditioned to join Linkin Park. Later in the 2000s, as the band's success took off, he again began using drugs before returning to sobriety, telling Spin Magazine in 2009: ""It's not cool to be an alcoholic. ""It's not cool to go drink and be a dumbass. ""It's cool to be a part of recovery. ""Most of my work has been a reflection of what I've been going through in one way or another,"" he added. Linkin Park was formed in 1996 and the band's 2000 debut album, Hybrid Theory, surfed the popular wave of nu-metal, Rolling Stone magazine writes. It eventually sold more than 30 million albums and became one of the top-selling albums since the start of this millennium. The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. Linkin Park had a string of hits including Faint, In The End and Crawling, and collaborated with rapper Jay-Z. Their latest music video for the song Talking to Myself was released on Thursday, on the same day of the artist's death. Bennington was said to be close to Sound Garden's Chris Cornell, who took his own life in May 2017. Bennington sang at the funeral for Cornell, who would have turned 53 on Thursday.

"It was legitimate to use “extraordinary measures”, they said, but some powers could threaten “democracy and fundamental rights”. Earlier this week Hungary’s parliament granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban sweeping new powers. Other states are considering similar measures. Europe has been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 30,000 fatalities. Spain has seen 10,000 deaths and Italy more than 13,000, and the numbers are rising across the continent, with daily records reported in France and the UK. Governments across the continent have imposed severe restrictions on movement in a bid to contain the spread. But there are fears some leaders and parties are using the pandemic as an excuse to tighten control over their countries. What does the statement say? The statement was issued on Wednesday by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok posted a link to the statement on Twitter. “The rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights must remain strong principles of our societies, also in times of coronavirus,” he wrote. Any new powers granted to fight the pandemic “should be proportionate and temporary in nature"", respect international law and be “subject to regular scrutiny”. “We need to jointly overcome this crisis and to jointly uphold our European principles and values on this path,” the 13 countries say, adding they support the European Commission's plans to monitor the measures. What are these emergency measures? Though no one country is specifically mentioned, it comes just two days after Hungary’s parliament gave the government powers to rule by decree. The law has no time limit. Mr Orban pledged to use his new powers ""proportionately and rationally"", but opposition party leader Peter Jakab said it put Hungarian democracy in quarantine. More than 100,000 people signed a petition against the measures before they passed. But Mr Orban’s right-wing Fidesz party has a strong majority, and polls suggest the public overwhelmingly support the move. Why it's not just Hungary Emergency measures have rung alarm bells in countries whose people can remember authoritarianism all too well. Serbia has been sliding down the Press Freedom Index in recent years - and journalists' organisations have warned the current crisis is making matters worse. The government ruled that only its crisis staff, led by Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, should make announcements about coronavirus - warning of ""legal consequences"" if this was not observed. One journalists' organisation said this was tantamount to censorship - and could lead to people being jailed for independent reporting. Indeed, shortly afterwards, police arrested a journalist who reported on hospital conditions in northern Serbia. Ms Brnabic has now promised to withdraw the ruling, and apologised for what she called her ""stupidity"". Slovenia's government has also found itself back-pedalling. Recently installed right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa wanted to give police powers to track quarantined people's phones, use facial recognition and enter homes. But he's been forced to give up these plans after the country's information commissioner warned that Slovenia would become a ""police state"" if he went ahead. But Albania has made some of Europe's most stringent emergency measures stick. They include a 16-hour curfew on weekdays - and a 40-hour lockdown at weekends. The restrictions were due to be lifted tomorrow. But the government has announced they will now be extended until the coronavirus crisis is over.",A group of 13 EU member states have said they are “deeply concerned” about the use of emergency measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.
"Protesters across continents waved placards and chanted slogans in what could be the biggest ever demonstration over global warming caused by humans. ""Our house is on fire"", Ms Thunberg said at a rally. ""We will not just stand aside and watch."" The day began in the Pacific and Asia and culminated in a massive demonstration in New York. It comes ahead of a UN summit next week at the organisation's headquarters in Manhattan. Activists are demanding greater efforts be made at the meeting to tackle climate change. Ms Thunberg first started skipping school to protest against inaction on climate change in 2018. Her actions have inspired schoolchildren and adults around the world to take up the fight. What happened on Friday? Pacific island nations like Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - all threatened by rising sea levels - kicked off the strike. Posts online showed citizens chanting: ""We are not sinking, we are fighting."" In Australia, 350,000 people are thought to have joined protests across the country, with some local authorities encouraging school children and workers to take part. The country is already suffering from soaring temperatures, and warming seas have contributed to the death of half the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's north-east coast. From there, demonstrations spread to cities in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. Students in Ghana marched in the capital Accra, saying climate change has sped up coastal erosion which is affecting people on the country's coast. About 44% of the population of Ghana have not heard of climate change, one study by Afrobarometer suggests. People in Thailand and India staged ""die-ins"", falling to the ground and feigning death to demand greater government action. As protests took place in 500 towns and cities across Germany, the country's coalition government announced a €54bn (£48bn; $60bn) package aimed at cutting greenhouse gases. And in the UK, hundreds of thousands are believed to have taken part in cities across all four countries. Further climate strikes are expected next week during the UN summit. What did Greta Thunberg say? The teenage activist was greeted like a rockstar at the rally on Friday, with chants of ""Greta! Greta!"" resounding around New York's Battery Park. ""This is the biggest climate strike ever in history, and we all should be so proud of ourselves because we have done this together,"" the teenager told demonstrators. Ms Thunberg said about four million people took part in the strike around the world, ""and we're still counting."" ""This is an emergency. Our house is on fire. And it's not just the young people's house, we all live here - it affects all of us,"" she told the crowd. Wherever she has gone in the world, she said, ""the empty promises are the same, the lies are the same and the inaction is the same"". The eyes of the world will be on leaders at the UN next week, and ""they have a chance to take leadership to prove they actually hear us"". ""This is what people power looks like,"" she said, before ending the speech with a word for those ""who feel threatened by us"". ""This is only the beginning,"" she said. ""Change is coming whether they like it or not."" Who is Greta Thunberg? Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg first staged a ""School Strike for Climate"" outside her national parliament in August last year. Her actions have inspired other schoolchildren and adults around the world, and she has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The 16-year-old travelled to the US by boat in August, refusing to fly or take a cruise ship due to the emissions those modes of transport cause. Ahead of her address to the UN next week, Ms Thunberg told US politicians they must do more to combat climate change. ""Don't invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it,"" she said.","Millions of people around the world held a global climate strike on Friday, inspired by activist Greta Thunberg."
"President Dilma Rousseff kicked a ball during the ceremony at the Castelao Arena in Fortaleza. Football's world governing body, Fifa, had repeatedly expressed concern over World Cup delays, including at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Castelao and the Maracana are among six venues that must be ready to host Fifa's Confederations Cup next June. The Castelao Arena, with a capacity of some 65,000, was renovated at a cost of $250m (£155m). ""This is a very special day for us at Fifa because it marks the two great events that will take place in Brazil in the coming years, the Confederations Cup and the World Cup,"" Fifa President Sepp Blatter said in a recorded message. Ms Rousseff said the inauguration of Castelao and the success of Sao Paulo football team Corinthians in the Club World Cup final showed Brazil was able to perform off and on the pitch. Next week, the Minerao Stadium in Belo Horizonte is due to be opened, after a complete refurbishment. Fifa has extended the December 2012 deadline, giving local organisers until mid-April to have the six stadiums, including the Maracana, ready for the two-week Confederations Cup. In recent years, Fifa officials have criticised Brazilian preparations with General Secretary Jerome Valcke at one point saying Brazil needed ""a kick up the backside."" But in recent weeks, Fifa officials have sounded more upbeat, saying that they expect all 12 stadiums to be ready on time. Mr Valcke said in November that the six grounds hosting the Confederations Cup - a tournament seen as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup - would meet the deadline. ""We [Fifa and Brazil] have found a way to work together,"" said Mr Valcke. Thousands of workers are busy at the Maracana and other stadiums. Of wider concern is the upgrade of the general infrastructure, including renovation of Brazil's airports, building new public transport, and ensuring there are sufficient hotel rooms.",Brazil has inaugurated the first of 12 stadiums being built or extensively renovated to host the 2014 World Cup.
"By Syed Shoaib HasanBBC News, Karachi Thirteen people - shopkeeper and customers - were shot dead here in cold blood on 18 October. But the massacre was not the work of criminal thugs or self-styled Islamic holy warriors. It began as a turf-war between two political parties, but has evolved into tit-for-tat ethnic cleansing. Imran, a shopkeeper, escaped the slaughter by hiding in his shop when the shooting started. But not everyone was so lucky: Imran heard his neighbours - Anees Rahman and his two sons - being gunned down. ""They also tried to hide inside - but the gunmen saw them,"" said Imran. ""Mr Rahman made his sons stay inside the shop and came out himself to negotiate with the men. ""He said, 'You have me; let my sons go.' ""But the gunmen shot him and then pulled up the shutters and opened fire."" Imran and all other eyewitnesses to whom the BBC spoke at the Rahman family funerals were in agreement about the gunmen's identities: ""They were Baloch and they came from Lyari,"" Imran said. ""I heard them asking, 'Who is Urdu-speaking here?'"" The Rahmans, along with the rest of those killed, belong to the Urdu-speaking community. The mourners were peaceful, but they were also angry at the government. ""The government has failed to keep the peace in Karachi,"" Asim, a mourner, told the BBC. ""If they can't deal with these people, they should give us a free hand. We will take care of them ourselves."" Politician murdered The shootings at the Shershah market, which sells mainly mechanical parts, followed two days of targeted attacks. At least 40 people died in the violence, which started on the eve of a hotly-contested election and culminated in the Shershah market slaughter. The vote was for a seat in the provincial parliament, after the former incumbent was murdered in August. The MQM political party, which dominates Karachi, won the election, as expected. It is supported by the city's majority Urdu-speaking community. Their rivals in the campaign were the ANP, which is dominated by Pashtuns. Pakistan's ruling PPP political party decided to back the ANP in the poll. Partners and enemies The ANP and MQM are minority partners in the PPP-run central government. But in Karachi, the two parties are sworn enemies. Each side accuses the other of killing rival party activists. It's not just the Urdu-speaking community that has been targeted. In fact, most of those killed belong to the Pashtun and Baloch communities. One of these is Rahman, a day labourer. An ethnic Baloch, he was shot dead in retaliatory killings that took place after the market attack. ""My son was a hard-working young man,"" said Jaan Bibi, Rahman's ailing, widowed mother. ""He had no political connections; he was the sole breadwinner for our family."" His brother, Imran, says Rahman was stopped with two other men as they were returning from work. ""They let the Urdu-speaking man go, but shot my brother and another man because they were Baloch,"" said Imran. Rahman's family lives in Lyari, where the men who attacked the spare-parts market are said to be based. Security agencies have said that the massacre was the work of the Lyari-based People's Amn (Peace) Committee. Urban powder keg But Shakeeb Baloch, a leader of the group, strongly denies this. ""Everybody knows the agencies act on the behalf of the governor here,"" he said. Dr Ishrat-ul-Ibad, the governor of the southern province of Sindh, where Karachi is located, is an MQM member. He offered to resign recently, citing loss of control over security agencies. ""We are not a political party; we are just a social group and want to make our voices heard by the government,"" he said. ""We have never been involved in attacks on anyone, but we reserve the right to defend ourselves."" The Urdu-speaking community is not one to let things lie. Karachi is the country's business capital and only operational commercial port. Huge concrete apartment complexes dot the skyline, cheek by jowl with some of the poorest slums in the world. It is this disparity which underpins almost all the problems in this mega-city of about 18 million people. People come here from all over the country in the hope of making it big. But the increasingly limited resources mean greater competition. Ethnic groups are increasingly armed with sophisticated weapons; the city is a powder keg. All of those involved have political connections. Karachi's residents say they no longer trust the government to protect their lives. Increasingly, there are calls for the army to take charge.",The shutters are down and the gates are padlocked at the spare-parts market in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi.
"By Dr John Swenson-WrightChatham House The NDC statement warns of the launch of a series of ""long-range rockets"" and a ""higher level"" nuclear test targeted against ""the US, the sworn enemy of the Korean people"". Satellite imagery analysed by US-based proliferation specialists reveals activity at Punggye-ri, the site of the 2006 and 2009 tests, and suggest that the North may be sealing a mountainside tunnel in imminent preparation for a test. Why might the North be preparing to test? 1: Deterrence: Since as early as the 1960s, North Korea has sought to become a nuclear state to protect itself from its adversaries, most notably the US, with which it remains in a state of war. Although Pyongyang has indicated its willingness to give up its nuclear capabilities, most recently in September 2005, when the North agreed to disable its nuclear programme in return for energy assistance and political recognition, its position has hardened appreciably since the collapse of the multilateral six-party talks in December 2008. The lessons of Gadaffi's Libya, which abandoned its fledgling nuclear programme only to be overthrown by local opposition supported by the US and the international community, has impressed on the North's leaders the need to retain their ultimate security guarantee. A third test would allow the DPRK to deter an attack from the US and its allies. America has some 28,000 troops stationed in South Korea (ROK) and ROK-US alliance relations will remain robust under the current administration of Lee Myung-bak and his successor Park Geun-hye who assumes office on 25 February. With Japan, under the new conservative administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, committed to increasing its defence spending, the DPRK may be seeking to strengthen itself in (from the North's perspective) an increasingly hostile environment. 2: Prestige and legitimacy: Passage by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2087, condemning North Korea's 12 December illegal launch of a satellite and imposing a fresh set of international sanctions, has irritated the North Korean leadership. It has stridently rejected the actions of the UN, while stressing its sovereign right to pursue rocket launches that it claims are primarily for peaceful space development. In April of 2012, the government modified its constitution to define itself officially as a ""nuclear armed nation"". Under its youthful 29-year-old new leader, Kim Jong-un, the government has trumpeted its technical achievements, both missile launches and the nuclear weapons programme, as proof of the strength of the North Korean state and, by extension, the new leader. Since his father's death in 2011, Kim has consolidated his leadership, steadily assuming prominent positions with the state, party and military hierarchies. Enhancing the country's nuclear assets may be a way of tilting the institutional balance within the country away from the military, which has seen some of its senior figures purged in recent months. 3: Technical advancement: US intelligence sources believe, contrary to North Korean denials, that Pyongyang has been seeking to develop a covert uranium-based nuclear weapons programme sufficient to generate enough fissile material to produce two nuclear bombs annually. Unlike the plutonium-based 2006 and 2009 tests, a uranium-based test would be a step forward in the sophistication of the North's nuclear capabilities. Alternatively Pyongyang, in referring to a ""higher level"" test, may simply be aiming to test a larger device, substantially bigger than the 1 and 2 kiloton tests of 2006 and 2009. Marks of success If the North is determined to test, there is at best a slim possibility that it can be deterred. UN sanctions are relatively toothless, and China, the country with the greatest leverage over the North given its prominent trade and investment ties, may be disinclined to put substantive pressure on Pyongyang, notwithstanding Chinese concerns that the persistent security crisis in the region is bolstering strategic co-operation between the US and its allies in a manner that undercuts Chinese security interests. A recent editorial in China's state-sponsored Global Times has hinted at the possibility of a cut in Chinese economic aid if a test goes ahead, and such action would not be unprecedented. China suspended economic assistance to the North in 2006 in protest against a series of provocative missile launches. However, state-backed papers frequently reflect a diversity of political opinions in China. China's senior leadership body, the Politburo Standing Committee, includes a number of prominent North Korea watchers sympathetic to a stable DPRK, and it is premature to assume that China will pressure a North Korea that historically has been fiercely averse to outside interference. For the North, the benchmarks of a successful test would be multiple. Technically, a high yield test would be self-evidently a sign of national strength. If it could be conducted without any obvious detection of radioactive gases (as was the case in 2009), it might prove an opportunity for the North to enhance collaborative testing with partner states such as Iran that might welcome an opportunity to test covertly. Testing is also a necessary step in marrying the North's nuclear assets with its ballistic missile capabilities, but it is not yet sufficient to allow the North to pose an immediate and credible strategic threat to its neighbours. Notwithstanding the 12 December rocket launch, the North's ballistic missile capabilities remain relatively underdeveloped. US intelligence sources suggest that the North has at best 30 intermediate range missiles, few technically proficient launch crews, and remains some years away from developing a genuinely indigenous missile programme. A nuclear-equipped missile launch would only be attractive in extremis if the North's leadership felt that regime survival was an issue, rather than as a means of securing strategic assets in a future conflict. For this reason, the primary value of a nuclear test is more likely to be political through enhancing the prestige of the government, attracting international attention and allowing the North to enhance its bargaining leverage in future negotiations with the United States and its allies. Whether such leverage is sufficient to persuade the Obama administration, preoccupied with a range of competing domestic and international challenges, to depart from a policy of ""strategic patience"" is still unclear, even allowing for the appointment of a new secretary of state - John Kerry - who reportedly favours a more engagement-centred approach to North Korea. John Swenson-Wright is Senior Consulting Fellow of the Asia Programme at Chatham House and Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, at the University of Cambridge.","Official announcements from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including a 24 January statement by the National Defence Committee (NDC), indicate that North Korea may be about to test a nuclear device - the third such instance, following two earlier tests in 2006 and 2009."
"Humanitarian co-ordinator Mark Lowcock said survey work showed the number entirely reliant on aid for survival was three million higher than thought. There was a clear danger of a famine ""much bigger than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives"", he added. Medics say the number of deaths linked to food-related factors is rising. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition intervened after the rebel Houthi movement seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.1 million people. In an address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Mr Lowcock said famines were a rarity in the modern world, which made the situation in Yemen ""shocking"". A famine is declared when three thresholds of food insecurity, acute malnutrition and mortality are together all breached. The three criteria are: Mr Lowcock said assessments conducted a year ago, which are currently being repeated, had found that in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts the first two thresholds were either already exceeded or dangerously close. The third threshold about the number of deaths was more difficult to confirm. He explained that many deaths were hidden because only half of Yemen's health facilities were functioning, and many Yemenis were too poor to access the ones that were open. Very few families report deaths at home. However, at the end of 2017 the charity Save the Children estimated that 130 children were dying every day from extreme hunger and disease - or almost 50,000 during the course of a year. The UN warned of famine in Yemen last year, but Mr Lowcock said the situation was ""now much graver"" for two reasons. ""Firstly, because of the sheer number of people at risk,"" he said. ""Our revised assessment... is that the total number of people facing pre-famine conditions, meaning they are entirely reliant on external aid for survival, could soon reach not 11 million but 14 million."" ""And secondly, beyond the sheer numbers, while millions of people have been surviving on emergency food assistance for years, the help they get is enough merely to survive. Not to thrive,"" he added. ""The toll is unbearably high. The immune systems of millions of people on survival support for years on end are now are literally collapsing, making them - especially children and the elderly - more likely to succumb to malnutrition, cholera and other diseases."" Mr Lowcock said the humanitarian crisis had been exacerbated by an economic crisis in Yemen and continued fighting around the rebel-held Red Sea port of Hudaydah, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food. He appealed for a cessation of hostilities around all infrastructure and facilities on which the aid operation relied; protection of the supply of food and essential goods; a larger injection of foreign exchange into the economy; increased funding for the humanitarian operation; and for all parties to engage in peace talks.","Half the population of war-torn Yemen - 14 million people - are facing ""pre-famine conditions"", the UN has warned."
"A spokesman for the Health Department said an isolator valve on a hot water main pipe failed causing flooding of the ward and some ancillary areas. He said no patients or staff were injured during the incident. The spokesman said patient care had been interrupted, however, no patients were adversely affected as a result and they had started to return to the ward. He thanked Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service for their assistance and said a full investigation would be carried out to find the cause of the valve failure.",The Le Marchant Ward at Guernsey's Princess Elizabeth Hospital has reopened after it was flooded.
"The ruling African National Congress (ANC) will decide at its five-day conference starting on Saturday whether to retain incumbent Jacob Zuma and Mr Motlanthe is the only person who can challenge him. He served as Mr Zuma's stand-in for six months in 2009 after then-President Thabo Mbeki was recalled from the position. At the time, analysts said the ANC had chosen him as interim president because he was a safe bet. But today's Mr Motlanthe is not as easy to dismiss. During the ANC's leadership nominations in preparation for the party's elective conference in Mangaung, Mr Motlanthe was the only person nominated to replace Mr Zuma - a sign of the respect he commands in sections of the party. The man had his first taste of the presidency during the ANC's most tumultuous period in post-apartheid South Africa - the recalling of Mr Mbeki in 2008, a first in the country's history. The ANC believed that Mr Motlanthe would not only bring unity and stability, but that he would not try to swindle Mr Zuma out of the top job. Mr Motlanthe acted as caretaker president until the 2009 election, when - as expected - he handed power to Mr Zuma. Son of a miner At school, Mr Motlanthe was influenced by the ideologies of the Black Consciousness Movement and the late anti-apartheid campaigner Steve Biko. He cut his political teeth in the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) where he was tasked with strengthening the trade union and where he worked from 1987 after serving 10 years on Robben Island - where Nelson Mandela was also imprisoned. During Mr Mandela's hospitalisation in January 2011, Mr Motlanthe immediately assumed a leadership role during the government's chaotic handling of the former president's admission into a Johannesburg private hospital. Mr Mandela called him by his old prison name Mokgomane, a word in the local Pedi language which means ""my boy"". Mr Motlanthe had been sent to jail for his activism a year after the 1976 Soweto uprising, when black students fought against the policy of forcing them to learn in Afrikaans. During his NUM years, Mr Motlanthe, whose father was a miner, was involved in training workers to form shop steward committees, among other things. In 1992 he was instrumental in negotiating favourable salaries for workers at a time when the gold industry was not flourishing and some companies were even closing down mines. This deal helped to avert massive retrenchments in the sector. As a former unionist, Mr Motlanthe has a thorough understanding of the intricate issues which fuelled the protests in the mining sector, including the tragedy which led to the killings of 34 miners in a bloody clash with the police in Marikana in August, correspondents say. A total of 46 people were killed during the six-week-long Marikana protests. 'Elder brother' His political rise has been slow but sure. In 1997, he became ANC secretary-general and served two terms in this position and 10 years later he was elected as the ruling party's deputy president. Affectionately known as ""mkhuluwa"", which means elder brother in the Zulu language, he is well respected within the ANC. According to South Africa's Business Day paper, he is regarded by many ""as the glue that holds the tripartite alliance [ANC, South African Communist Party and trade union federation Cosatu] together"". Usually smartly dressed in a blazer and tailored trousers, the 63-year-old has maintained a low public profile. Little is known about his personal life but a book about him has recently been published by Ebrahim Harvey called Kgalema Motlanthe: A political biography. It is an authorised biography and gives insight into who he is. Mr Harvey refers to the deputy president by his first name throughout the book and tells of how he forgave his wife after she got pregnant with another man's daughter while he was on Robben Island. The marriage broke down years later. Accountability Mr Harvey's book also speaks of how Mr Motlanthe saved President Zuma from expulsion from the ANC after reports of his alleged corruption - he instead defended the ANC's decision to back Mr Zuma in his battle against the charges. During the bitter dispute over the corruption case, then ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema said he was prepared to kill for Mr Zuma. Mr Zuma's supporters said they would organise huge protests outside the court, which some saw as an attempt to intimidate the judge hearing the case. It was Mr Motlanthe who urged the Youth League to respect the judiciary, earning the respect of many in the country. In March, accusations were made against Mr Motlanthe's long-term partner Gugu Mtshali. Ms Mtshali is elegant, well-travelled, educated and poised - some have commented that she is First Lady material. However, she sits on numerous boards, some say too many, representing a wide range of companies and Mr Motlanthe's allies worry that her business dealings could tarnish his reputation. South Africa's The Sunday Times newspaper reported that Ms Mtshali was ""implicated in soliciting a 104 million rand ($12m; £7m) bribe to obtain a sanctions-busting deal with Iran"". Mr Motlanthe asked Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, who plays a role similar to that of an ombudsman, to investigate the allegations and she cleared the couple of wrongdoing. Mr Motlanthe's allies say his prompt action showed his commitment to accountability - in contrast to Mr Zuma, who has been accused of not doing enough to tackle corruption during his three years in power.","Kgalema Motlanthe has already served as South Africa's president, if only for six months, and is now seeking to return on a long-term basis."
"Norwegian Gen Robert Mood, the head of the UN Stabilisation Mission (UNSMIS), said observers would cease operations because of the escalating violence. But he said the mission remained committed to ending the violence. The UK foreign secretary said the decision called into question the mission's viability. William Hague blamed the government of President Bashar al-Assad for the worsening situation. In a statement, he said the suspension of patrols and restriction of staff movements "" underlines the extent of the deterioration of security and stability in Syria, and calls into serious question the viability of the UN Mission "". Activists reported on Saturday that at least 60 people had been killed around the country, with the worst violence in areas around Damascus, where they said 10 people were murdered in the town of Saqba. At least seven people were killed in Douma, an eastern suburb of the capital Damascus, while at least 18 others died in violence elsewhere, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. The opposition Syrian National Council also warned of a looming massacre in Homs which it says is besieged by 30,000 troops and pro-regime militiamen. Syria restricts access to foreign media, and reports of killings are difficult to verify. Civilians 'suffering' US White House spokesman Tommy Vietor urged Syria to abide by international mediator Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan. ""At this critical juncture, we are consulting with our international partners regarding next steps toward a Syrian-led political transition as called for in Security Council resolutions,"" he said. Arab League spokesman Ahmad Bin Hilli told the BBC the decision was a temporary one, and the operation could be cancelled only by the UN in consultation with the Arab League. Announcing the suspension of UNSMIS operations, Gen Mood said the suspension would be ""reviewed on a daily basis"" and that a ""return to normal operations remains our objective"". The UN Security Council's five permanent members will consider the next steps for the observer mission when Gen Mood briefs them on the situation in Syria on Tuesday. The mission's 298 military observers and 112 civilian staff were sent to Syria to verify the implementation of the Annan plan, which included a ceasefire.","The US has said it is consulting international partners over steps to take over Syria, after UN observers suspended their activities."
"What happened? The facilities came under attack at 04:00 (01:00 GMT) on Saturday. Online videos showed explosions and large fires at the Abqaiq oil processing facility. In a statement Saudi Arabia later announced the fires had been brought under control within hours, and no one had been killed or injured. However the fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in global oil supplies, according to the statement. What was the impact on the Abqaiq refinery? Analysts have identified at least 17 hits. An unnamed senior US official told ABC News the attacks on the Abqaiq refinery had involved a dozen cruise missiles and more than 20 drones. A number of ""spheroids"" used to process crude oil were hit, apparently with pinpoint accuracy, and fires from blasts at other parts of the facility can also be seen. Analyst Anthony Cordesman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggests the attacks could have been carried out using relatively unsophisticated drones operating as ""weapons of mass effectiveness"". ""It is virtually impossible to secure civilian facilities from a worker or visitor's capability to use a cell phone to get precise GPS coordinates, commercial satellite coverage is now very good, and there are many ways to produce the kind of image needed for terminal guidance from ordinary photos,"" he writes. US officials say the images show damage consistent with coming from a west-north-west direction, not Houthi-controlled territory which lies to the south-west of the refinery. Abqaiq is the world's largest oil processing facility, and about two-thirds of Saudi Arabia's total output is refined there. Some seven million barrels of oil are processed each day. The facility refines crude oil pumped from the Ghawar field, and is connected to both the Shaybah oil field through a 636-km (395-mile) pipeline and an export terminal in Yanbu. What was the impact on the Khurais oilfield? Infrastructure at the site, which is about 180km south-west of Abqaiq, also sustained damage. Satellite images show two significant hits to two towers, with scorch marks visible on the ground from a significant fire. The Khurais oil field is believed to produce more than one million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of more than 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Saudi oil company Aramco. .",Satellite images issued by the United States have revealed the extent of the damage to two key Saudi oil facilities attacked by drones at the weekend.
"By Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The case of Daniel M, a Swiss man arrested by the Germans on charges of spying, has focused attention in Switzerland on the activities of the Swiss intelligence services, the banks and the often awkward relationship between Switzerland and Germany. Daniel M, now detained in Mannheim in south-west Germany, was once a police officer in Zurich, then a security specialist for Swiss banking giant UBS and finally, it is alleged, a spy for the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS). During the years of Daniel M's multifaceted career, Germany watched with growing irritation as its citizens squirreled their savings away in Swiss banks, in effect - thanks to Switzerland's famed banking secrecy laws - hiding their money from the German tax authorities. Pressure At the same time, the Swiss government, faced with globalisation, and Switzerland's need to have good trading relations with the European Union, began to realise that banking secrecy was no longer the economic advantage it may once have been. Methodically but very, very slowly, the Swiss government began to dismantle banking secrecy. New laws on money laundering - among the world's strictest - were approved and tax disclosure agreements were discussed with European neighbours. All the while the Swiss banks delayed and objected and Germany ratcheted up the pressure. In 2009, Peer Steinbrück, the then German finance minister, warned that if the Swiss did not behave, Germany might have to ""send in the cavalry"". Nothing could have been calculated to more infuriate the neutral Swiss, who insisted they would not be cowed by threats from what the Swiss sometimes call ""the big canton to the north"". Germany's ambassador to Berne was swiftly summoned for a dressing-down. Secrecy unveiled But the process of killing off banking secrecy continued, helped by massive losses for big banks UBS and Credit Suisse in the 2008-2009 sub-prime mortgage crisis. There were also suggestions that those same banks were still aiding and abetting tax evasion, advising clients to invest in artwork or precious stones to disguise cash and even suggesting they hide diamonds in tubes of toothpaste. Meanwhile, Germany, impatient for its lost tax revenue, began to buy client information which had been stolen from Swiss banks. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone has spent millions of euros on at least 11 CDs containing information on German citizens with Swiss bank accounts. Again, this infuriated the Swiss. Government ministers painstakingly shepherding banking reform through parliament were angry that Germany - instead of waiting for the promised agreement on sharing banking information - had, in effect, walked in and helped itself. Bizarre twist For some, it looked as if Mr Steinbrück's cavalry had actually charged. At some point, Switzerland's intelligence chiefs seem to have concluded that the Germans had gone far enough and decided to investigate the theft of data from Swiss banks. Who had stolen it, who was selling it and who was buying it on behalf of Germany? The intelligence service turned to Daniel M, now no longer working for UBS, because - and here is the bizarre twist - he was suspected of dealing with the Germans in stolen banking data. Long before his arrest in Frankfurt, Daniel M had already been arrested in Zurich as part of an investigation into the theft of bank data. What happened during that arrest? Was Daniel M ""turned"" by the Swiss authorities? The details are murky, but the Germans allege that, between at least 2012 and 2015, Daniel M - armed with 90,000 euros (£76,000) in cash and a prepaid mobile phone - was spying in Germany, hoping to bribe German officials for information, and even trying to plant a mole in North Rhine-Westphalia's finance ministry. Ironically, it appears the Swiss attorney general's office - which had not closed its case on Daniel M - actually gave Germany the information which led to his arrest in Frankfurt on 28 April. 'Hung out to dry' Meanwhile, FIS, the agency which is supposed to know everything, knew nothing until the arrest became public. Now it was Germany's turn to be outraged, and Switzerland's ambassador to Berlin's turn to face criticism. Swiss government ministers were once again squirming with frustration and embarrassment. While FIS chief Markus Seiler refused to confirm or deny Daniel M was an agent, Switzerland's defence minister Guy Parmelin told Swiss media there had been no contact between Daniel M and the intelligence service ""since 2014"". Now the case will end up in the courts. Daniel M has hired a high-profile Zurich lawyer, who has demanded that FIS contribute to his client's legal costs. FIS has not responded, leaving the lawyer to threaten that if Daniel M is ""hung out to dry"" by his former bosses in the intelligence service, he may use his court appearance to sing like a canary. Much more intrigue and drama is predicted, and relations between Germany and Switzerland, always a trifle sensitive, are on tenterhooks. But meanwhile the everyday business between the two neighbours continues. Switzerland and Germany actually signed that tax disclosure agreement back in 2015: there is no longer any point in stealing banking data, or spying on those who might buy it. The Swiss foreign minister Didier Burkhalter has suggested the spy scandal is an ""old story"" that should be forgotten. ""No way, minister!"" responded mass circulation Blick newspaper in a furious editorial. The Swiss want answers. Some ask whether their intelligence services were just bumblingly incompetent, or whether they could have been serving the interests of the banks even as elected officials strove to regulate them. Others, remembering that the Tunisian extremist responsible for Berlin's Christmas market attack in which 12 people died, had both a gun bought in Switzerland and a Swiss mobile, are asking why FIS does not concentrate on the more important matter of combating terrorism. The whole affair is now likely to be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry.","The story could be straight out of a Graham Greene novel, or a James Bond film."
"Sark's government, Chief Pleas, unanimously approved mortgages to be used to buy property from February. Currently anyone who wishes to live on the island has to rent property or buy the land outright. Another reform approved on Thursday introduces legal protections for tenants from eviction without notice for the first time. Sark was subdivided in to 40 sections by order of the British Crown in 1565. A further royal decree in 1611 established these sections could not be be split up in to smaller parcels of land and sold off. These parcels of land were originally for 40 families to act as a military garrison, with an acre of land to support themselves. Conseiller William Raymond, who brought the proposals forward, told Chief Pleas these reforms were just the beginning of changes to the land management rules. He argued all of the 500 or so people living on Sark deserved the ability to purchase their own home or land. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raymond explained the reforms were ""terribly important for the future of Sark"". He added elderly residents of the island were concerned about outliving the duration of their lease, which was detrimental to the ""stability of the community"".",The Channel Island of Sark has reformed land laws dating back to the 17th Century.
"In his recent address to the nation in the wake of the ending of the EU-IMF bailout the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, suggested that in future banks should stop dragging the economy down and deal with the issue of distressed mortgages. BBC NI Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison has been talking to people who are very worried about holding on to their homes. That is about 200,000 cases and it includes Caroline. A professional, single woman in her late 30s, she is struggling to come to terms with how her life has changed. She had mortgages on two properties, an apartment in Dublin, where she lives, and a house in Kilkenny, where she used to work. After she lost her permanent and pensionable job in 2006 she sold her Kilkenny house at a loss of 150,000 euros (£127,000) and now her bank wants her Dublin home to make up the shortfall. Deal ""Mentally, it's extremely difficult to try to deal with this sort of situation, there are tears and stress,"" she said, ""You don't sleep and there's sheer panic because of the banks. You don't tend to see sense."" Anna, a 58-year-old nurse, knows all about those worries. After her 60-year-old husband, Patrick, was made redundant they borrowed 340,000 euros (£287,000) to open up a delicatessen on the east coast of Ireland using their family home as security, without, she said, thinking of the consequences. It did not work out and now her bank wants their house. She said: ""I do work and I want to give as much as I possibly can. I would be happy to look at a long-term deal. ""A good outcome for me would be to make a deal with the bank that they took the house or part of the house at some stage but I want to live there for the rest of my life."" Anna and Caroline, who do not want their full names used, got in contact with the Portlaoise-based Phoenix Project Ireland. The organisation, which depends on donors and gets no state funding, gives free advice and help to people with mortgage difficulties. It was set up in 2007 by William Prior, who was an estate agent at the time and who saw increasing numbers of farmers, in particular, taking their own lives. ""This organisation is here to help people; to save people from losing their family home and stopping the resulting break-up of marriages and relationships and families"", he says. Between full-time staff and volunteers the Phoenix Project has 20 people helping it. 'Take advice' Among them is Amanda Grace, a counsellor who offers this advice to people with mortgage problems: ""As long as there is inaction there will be more stress. ""So, we try to get people to own the problem, to confront it, so to, at least, level the playing field in terms of how much power you think you have over your own outcome."" Julie Sadlier, a solicitor with the Phoenix Project, offers legal advice. ""We say to people 'keep engaging, keep paying what you can',"" she said. ""And don't surrender your keys under any circumstances, unless you really don't care about the property and the shortfall, without taking advice. ""Unfortunately, people don't have money to pay for advice but we're here and we're free and we'll keep trying to fit people in as much as we can."" Recent figures suggest that for every home repossession in the Republic of Ireland there are 13 in Northern Ireland. But Caroline, who faces such a threat, said she hoped she would never have to take out a mortgage again because she does not trust the banks and financial institutions. Priorities ""If I'd known that the banks were in such a dreadful financial state, if I'd known what was going on at Anglo, if I'd known the government was on the point of collapse I'd never have taken out a bank loan,"" she said. ""But I'm sure I speak for every citizen who took out a mortgage at that particular time."" The banks said they do not comment on individual cases like those of Anna and Caroline and that they are trying to deal with the issue of distressed mortgages by offering, where possible, sustainable longer-term resolutions. But Anna says those with mortgage difficulties need to get their priorities right. ""People are so worried that they are giving every single penny to the bank and they can't afford to feed their children"", she said. ""I say, feed your children and not the banks. Your family has to come first"". As the country emerges from its EU-IMF bailout the prime minister, Enda Kenny, recently made clear he is very much aware that old problems like the banks and distressed mortgages have not gone away.",It is estimated that nearly 20% of all mortgages in the Republic of Ireland are in arrears.
"By Marta MoreirasPhotographer, Dakar Dakar has a fashion hub in Africa since Senegalese designer and entrepreneur Adama Paris started Dakar Fashion Week in 2002. This year she also invited US designer Mickey Freeman, seen above adding his special touch to his creations. Renowned designers and new talents - like Queen Tawa (above left) - were part of the line-up. A young singer from Congo-Brazzaville, Queen Tawa recently launched her label Liputa Swagga - Afro-futuristic extravaganza at its best. The swagger of her designs certainly impressed the audience, which started clapping and cheering as the models walked down the catwalk. She told the BBC the shoulders were like wings: ""I often dream that I fly away, that's what it inspires me, my dreams - flying and levitating."" Other designers launching their new collections came from Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Morocco, Niger - and also included home-grown talents such as Rama Diaw, one of whose creations is seen above. Moments of joy and excitement were evident backstage on the last day of the event, which proved successful with those who came to Senegal to discover ""Made in Africa"" pieces. Here models wait backstage in Sisters of Afrika outfits by a Senegalese fashion label, which was established in 2013 with a vision to create colourful designs for women of all shapes. During the week there was a wide range of designs, from simple and elegant outfits to exclusive and unique dresses. Here, a designer, stylist and assistant help a model get ready for the stage. Favourite designs and shows were snapped and filmed and shared on social media using the hashtag #dakarfashionweek2019. The venue was a great opportunity to promote the best fabrics and accessories from Africa, including this corset from Kenyan fashion label Moyo By Bibi. Western-style outfits were also on show. Dozens of hair stylists and make-up artists also worked around the clock. The frenetic activity backstage contrasted sometimes with moments of nervous waiting. One model took to the catwalk wearing a design from Senegalese label So' Fatoo, founded by Fatima Zahra Ba, who named her fashion company after her grandmother Fatou Sow. And Senegalese model Alima Diop wowed the audience on the last night in an eclectic design by local fashion house Al Gueye.

"It says that the measures have been implemented in part to ""preserve security and stability and fight the danger of terrorist threats"". Correspondents say it is the largest number of Bahrainis to be stripped of their nationality since 2013. At that time a law was introduced to punish people convicted of terrorism. Bahrain has been wracked by unrest since an uprising in 2011 in which the Shia majority demanded democratic reforms from the Sunni-led government. Tensions have been high since elections in November were boycotted by the opposition, who said parliament lacked sufficient powers and that constituency boundaries had been redrawn to favour their supporters. Strongly condemned The Reuters news agency says the fact that Saturday's list includes the names of well-known Sunni and Shia Muslim families indicates that the move is not solely directed at eradicating long-running unrest among Bahrain's Shia Muslim majority. The revocation policy has been strongly condemned by human rights groups. Previous citizenship revocations in recent years have been directed at activists abroad and in Bahrain, who were afterwards told to leave the country. ""The ruler of Bahrain revoked my citizenship today without a court, any charges or clear evidence of why,"" British-based Bahraini blogger and activist Ali Abdulemam wrote on Twitter. Bahrain's governing al-Khalifa family used martial law and assistance from its neighbours in the Gulf to suppress a Shia uprising in 2011, but the unrest has persisted and protesters and police often clash.","The government of Bahrain has revoked the nationality of 72 citizens on grounds of damaging national security, the state BNA news agency has reported."
"If confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first woman ever to hold the post. She was among several women chosen for top economic positions. The Biden transition team said others were set to break racial barriers if confirmed. Mr Biden has pledged to build a diverse administration. He earlier appointed an all-female senior press team. His transition team said his picks for senior economic roles would help ""lift America out of the current economic downturn and build back better"". Mr Biden has also announced the formation of a Presidential Inaugural Committee ahead of his swearing-in on 20 January. The committee will be responsible for organising inauguration-related activities. Also on Monday, Mr Biden got his first look at the daily presidential intelligence briefing as president-elect. The overview of national security threats to the US is usually offered as a courtesy to incoming White House administrations, but was initially withheld as Mr Trump refused to concede victory. Who is Janet Yellen? Ms Yellen had been widely tipped for the nomination in media reports prior to Monday's announcement. The 74-year-old economist has served as head of America's central bank and as a top economics adviser to former President Bill Clinton. She is credited with helping steer the economic recovery after the 2007 financial crisis and ensuing recession. As chair of the US Federal Reserve, Ms Yellen was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality. Mr Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. Starting with Bill Clinton in the 1990s, presidents kept on bank leaders appointed by their predecessors in an effort to de-politicise the bank. Since leaving the bank in 2018, Ms Yellen has spoken out about climate change and the need for Washington to do more to shield the US economy from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In a tweet following Monday's announcement, Ms Yellen said: ""We face great challenges as a country right now. To recover, we must restore the American dream - a society where each person can rise to their potential and dream even bigger for their children. ""As Treasury Secretary, I will work every day towards rebuilding that dream for all."" President of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde praised Mr Biden's choice, writing in a tweet: ""Her intelligence, tenacity and calm approach make Janet a trailblazer for women everywhere."" Republican Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Chuck Grassley said that he expects Ms Yellen to ""get a favourable view"" during confirmation hearings before his committee. What about the other names? Biden transition officials said the senior economic team is set to include ""several historic trailblazers"". Picks include former Obama administration official Wally Adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary and economist Cecilia Rouse as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. If confirmed, Mr Biden's team said both would be the first African Americans in those roles. Mr Biden will nominate Neera Tanden, who worked with the Obama administration on the creation of Obamacare, to head the Office of Management and Budget. If confirmed, she would be the first woman of colour and first South Asian American to lead the agency. But she is likely to be at the centre of the hardest confirmation fight in the Senate. Critics have found tweets by her from four years ago, in which she appeared to stoke debunked conspiracy theories that Russian hackers changed votes in the 2016 election in favour of Mr Trump. On Monday, the Biden campaign also trumpeted its all-female press team, prompting the Trump White House to point out that its press team has been led by women since 2017, even if some of the lower-level aides are men. Neera Tanden pick draws controversy Joe Biden might have his first big presidential appointment fight on his hands. The president-elect's choice of Neera Tanden, a longtime Democratic operative, to be his White House budget office director - which requires Senate confirmation - is getting sharp attacks from the left and the right. Grass-roots liberals don't like Tanden because of her outspoken criticism of the party's progressive movement and its standard-bearer, former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. Conservatives don't like her because of her personal jabs at their leaders. And Tanden's views are well-documented, given that some of her most incendiary comments came on social media. Concern about problematic tweets might seem quaint after four years of Donald Trump's presidency, of course. And the Senate's 2018 confirmation of Ric Grenell - a notorious Twitter provocateur - to be Trump's ambassador to Germany suggests that inflammatory social media posts are not by themselves disqualifying. Grenell, however, had a Republican majority supporting his nomination. Pending the outcome of Georgia's Senate races, Biden could face a chamber controlled by the opposition - and a left flank disinclined to help. Biden has touted his ability to work with the Senate to get things done. If he wants Tanden, this will be an early test of his skills. What's the latest with the election aftermath? Monday's nominations came as Arizona and Wisconsin officially certified Mr Biden's victory. President Donald Trump is expected to issue legal challenges to the vote in both states. At the Trump campaign's request, a second recount is due to be completed by Wednesday in another state where Mr Biden was declared the winner, Georgia. On Monday, Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said those trying to overturn the election results in the state were ""dishonest actors"" spreading ""massive amounts of disinformation"". He added: ""There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and, frankly, they're misleading the president as well, apparently."" The Trump campaign is also mounting legal challenges to Mr Biden's victories in Michigan and Nevada. The campaign has seen other lawsuits it filed dismissed in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan.

"However the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain, is the biggest party. As a result, it is unclear who will be given the right to form a government. The Madrid government stripped Catalonia of its autonomy and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal. With nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were together on course to win a total of 70 seats, giving them a majority. Within the separatist party block, ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's JxCat was slightly ahead of the ERC, led by his former deputy, Oriol Junqueras. Speaking in Brussels, where he is in self-imposed exile, Mr Puigdemont said the ""Catalan republic"" had won and ""the Spanish state has been defeated"". The situation called for ""rectification, reparation and restitution,"" he said. He is accused by Spanish prosecutors of rebellion and sedition. Mr Junqueras faces the same charges and is currently in prison. Citizens (Cs) had 25% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber. Its leader Inés Arrimadas told the BBC her party had been ""victorious"". She said forming a coalition would be ""difficult - but we will try"". The Popular Party (PP) of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who took the decision to remove Catalonia's autonomy, was projected to win just three seats in the new Catalan parliament, down from 11 in the 2015 election. Election turnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. Why did the election take place? Separatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October, after the referendum which was declared illegal by Spain. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots. The move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured. Footage showing police tackling people at polling stations. According to the organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part. Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain. Mr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election. Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. What has been the reaction? The European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency. ""In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,"" he added. The Spanish government has not yet commented on the results. What happens now? Analysts say the success of separatist parties means that the ball is now back in the Spanish government's court. Antonio Barroso, of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence, said the problem for Madrid remains ""and the secession movement is not going to go away"". Why do many Catalans want independence? Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years. Before the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under Gen Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75. When Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain. A 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a ""nation"", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010. Recession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement. Following a trial referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election and went on to win a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also banned and boycotted by unionists.","Catalan separatist parties are on track to win most seats in the new regional parliament, setting the stage for more confrontation with Spain's government."
"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them ""more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity"". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public places, to Uighur militants inspired or aided by overseas terror groups. It has launched a crackdown in the region, arresting and jailing scores of people. But Uighur activists say that China's strong-arm tactics in Xinjiang - including cultural and religious repression - are fuelling tensions. Uighurs and Xinjiang Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs?","The Islamic face veil is to be banned in public in the capital of China's restive Xinjiang region, home to its Uighur Muslim minority."
"A double amputee, she was the first disabled woman elected to the US Congress. Born in Bangkok to a Thai mother and American father, she was also among the first Asian-American women in Congress. And now, as confirmed in a gleeful tweet this week, she will be the first woman to have a baby while serving in the US Senate. It was ""about damn time"", the 49-year-old said. ""I can't believe it took until 2018."" On the day Donald Trump defied the odds to defeat Hillary Clinton in November 2016, Tammy Duckworth made her own journey - soundly defeating the Republican incumbent to become the junior senator for Illinois, the position held by Barack Obama when he won the presidency. Her election came four days shy of the anniversary of the event that shaped her later life. ""I'm here because of the miracles that occurred 12 years ago this Saturday - above and in a dusty field in Iraq,"" she said in her victory speech. Among the people she thanked were her former military comrades: the men who saved her life after the helicopter she was co-piloting over Iraq was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. You may find some of the following details distressing Duckworth was a captain with the Illinois National Guard when she was called up to serve in Iraq. It was a war she disagreed with, but she fully accepted the responsibility to go there and fight. She did not have to go to Iraq. She was no longer in charge of her former unit when they were called to serve, but she asked to go with them. ""You don't want anyone to face danger and you not face the same danger,"" she told an episode of The Axe Files podcast in December 2016. ""You have to face the same risk."" After a day of routine missions in November 2004, she and her crew were asked to pick up some soldiers from Taji, about 20 miles north of Baghdad. When they got there, the soldiers had already left. The crew decided to return to their base in Balad, about 30 miles further north, and Duckworth handed control of the Black Hawk helicopter to her co-pilot Dan Milberg. During the journey, as they flew low over palm trees to avoid detection, she heard the ""tap, tap, tap"" of gunfire against the helicopter. She leaned forward to get the GPS co-ordinates to report where the helicopter had been shot. ""Right then, bam, the fireball happened in my lap with an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] going off,"" she told The Axe Files. ""It took off most of the back of my right arm because I had that forward. It blew off my right leg, it basically evaporated. ""My left leg was kicked up into an instrument. The force of that sheared it almost off, it was hanging on a little bit."" Duckworth drifted in and out of consciousness. Every time she became conscious again, she would try to operate the pedals to control the helicopter, but struggled to understand why she couldn't. She did not realise she no longer had feet. Dan Milberg landed the helicopter and carried Duckworth out. Her crew had assumed she was dead, but by nevertheless moving her quickly from the helicopter to get aid, they saved her life. Duckworth woke up about 11 days later, in pain and angry. She had lost both legs and most of the use of her right arm. In later years, she adapted a playful attitude to her amputation - wearing a T-shirt saying ""Dude, where's my leg?"" and addressing the Democratic National Convention with one prosthetic leg painted in camouflage, the other in the American flag. In hospital though, one of her first thoughts was revenge against her attacker. ""I wanted to hunt him down,"" she told The Axe Files. In the end she underwent countless operations and spent 13 months in hospital, much of it at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington DC. The hospital, packed with soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, became what she called ""an amputee petting zoo"" for politicians seeking photo opportunities. It was perhaps inevitable that Duckworth had ended up joining the military, even if she had initially resisted, having hoped to join the diplomatic service instead. Generations of her family had served in the military, going as far back as the American Revolution. Her father Frank fought in World War Two and the Vietnam War. A fierce patriot, Frank Duckworth was a Marine and served as a signal officer in Vietnam. But he found himself confronted and spat at when he returned to the US in between tours as the movement against the Vietnam War gathered strength. He preferred to stay in south-east Asia in between tours, and met Lamai Sompornpairin, who had grown up sewing hats in a Thai factory and was then working in her parents' grocery shop. The couple, with baby Tammy in tow, stayed in the region after the war while Frank worked for the UN Development Programme and different corporations. Tammy spoke nothing but Thai until she was eight years old. Her experiences with conflict began at a young age, as the Marxist Khmer Rouge regime took power in Cambodia. She has said some of her earliest childhood memories are of being in Phnom Penh, watching bombs going off. She said her parents told her to think of them as fireworks, so she would not be scared. The latter period of her time in Asia, living in Indonesia and Singapore, gave her pride in being American, and in seeing how people abroad viewed her country. Yet the Duckworths later fell on hard times as Frank Duckworth lost his job. Despite his reluctance to return to a country he felt had rejected him, he had no choice but to go back to the US. At several points, Tammy Duckworth's story echoes that of President Obama, the man who called her ""a tough lady, but with a big heart"" as she ran for his old Senate seat. Both have acknowledged how their mixed-race origins helped form their identities. Both grew up in Indonesia at around the same time, and both left Asia to live in Hawaii. While Duckworth said the move to a multicultural state like Hawaii was the perfect way for her to assimilate into US life, it was a hard transition for her father. The family depended on food stamps to survive. In 2013, she reflected on her teenage years while speaking in Congress against possible cuts to food stamps. ""They were there for me, so I could worry about school and not about my empty stomach."" Often, Duckworth and her brother Thomas could eat only if their father had found enough coins left in telephone kiosks. When she found work after school, she was the only member of her family to have a job. Her father, who died in 2005, went on to find work at a chicken factory, and Duckworth was able through grants and loans to make her way to three universities. In the end, it was her classmates who convinced her that she could achieve her eventual aim of being an ambassador by joining the military first. ""What I didn't expect was to fall in love with the camaraderie and sense of purpose that the military instills in you,"" Duckworth wrote in Politico in 2015. ""The thing is, when we were exhausted and miserable, my fellow cadets and I were exhausted and miserable together."" Among the other cadets was her future husband, Bryan Bowlsbey. It wasn't immediately obvious the two were destined for marriage. ""He made a comment that I felt was derogatory about the role of women in the Army,"" she told the C-Span news network in 2005, ""but he came over and apologised very nicely and then helped me clean my M16."" It would be far from the last time Duckworth would face a derogatory comment, but it would be the only time she would marry the man who made it. Duckworth's political career took off as her rehabilitation from her injuries was continuing. It was an invitation by Illinois Democrat senator Dick Durbin to attend the 2005 State of the Union address that first ignited her interest. Duckworth had already become an unofficial adviser to younger veterans within Walter Reed hospital, leading Mr Durbin to suggest she should consider running for office. She ran as a candidate for Congress in Illinois in 2006, barely two years after the attack in Iraq. But she lost the race to Republican Peter Roskam by only 5,000 votes. ""I sat in a bathtub and cried for three days,"" she said. Over the following years, she continued her duties with the National Guard and as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs, where she launched a hotline for suicidal veterans and helped improve access to healthcare payments and work for veterans. In 2008, newly elected President Obama appointed her as an assistant secretary to the federal Department of Veterans' Affairs. Then in 2012, she ran for Congress again in another Illinois district - this time against an opponent who openly disparaged her military record. Joe Walsh was hardly the most popular candidate when he ran against Duckworth in Illinois' eighth district. When the Republican incumbent was sued by his ex-wife over missed child support payments, and when he shouted at a constituent, his chances became even slimmer. Then when he attacked the service carried out by Duckworth, by this point a recipient of the Purple Heart medal for those injured in service, his fate was perhaps sealed. ""I'm running against a woman who, my God, that's all she talks about,"" he said at a town hall meeting. ""Our true heroes, it's the last thing in the world they talk about."" Duckworth ended up winning 54.7% of the vote, compared with Walsh's 45.3%. She held on the seat two years later. A month later, at the age of 46 and after several unsuccessful courses of IVF treatment, she gave birth to her first child, Abigail. Duckworth often reflects back on the day her helicopter was struck, and acknowledges how her time in the military has helped shape the politician she is today. ""That day, and so many others when I served, illustrated the two most important lessons the military taught me,"" she wrote in Politico magazine. ""Never leave anyone behind - not on the battlefield and not in our country. And never put a service member in harm's way without understanding the cost."" But as Duckworth's first race for the Senate was entering its final stretch in October 2016, the Chicago Tribune pointed out that her much-vaunted record on helping veterans had been mixed. After a decade in public service, the newspaper said, ""several"" of her initiatives to help Illinois veterans ""fell flat"", her post in the federal veterans' affairs body ""mostly focused on public relations"" and her two terms in Congress were ""marked by only a few legislative successes"". Duckworth has defended her record, but even one of her headline pieces of policy - a bill she sponsored requiring airports to provide spaces for breastfeeding mothers - has yet to become law. As a senator, her record will now face even more scrutiny. She reached the Senate after another bruising election campaign in 2016, one that saw her opponent Mark Kirk belittle her family's military history. She started her time as a senator optimistically, expressing hope that she and fellow Democrats could work with President Trump. ""I am going to start off assuming that he loves this country as much as I love this country,"" she told The Axe Files podcast just before taking office. ""If you start off from that point, I think you can learn to work with anyone."" It has not worked out that way. Instead, Duckworth has positioned herself as one of the most persistent and vocal critics of the president, on issues relating to the military and immigration in particular. Last weekend, as Trump attacked Democrats for not helping pass a funding bill that he said was ""holding our military hostage"", Duckworth attacked him from the Senate floor - noting how he had repeatedly avoided service in Vietnam because of a reported bone spur in his foot. ""I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger,"" she said. ""And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong-un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops and millions of innocent civilians in danger."" Duckworth has been especially critical of Trump over North Korea, warning last month that he and the defence community were gearing up for war. Amid her criticism of the president, the rumblings of a Tammy Duckworth run for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential race have already started. While she has not acknowledged any interest in running - at least not yet - Duckworth is surely aware that one significant political 'first' has still not been achieved: the first female president.",Tammy Duckworth is used to being a trailblazer.
"The book, by two New York Times journalists, says Mr Trump suggested extreme methods of deterring migrants from crossing the southern border. They included building an electrified, spiked border wall and a snake or alligator-infested moat. Calling the claims ""fake news"", Mr Trump tweeted: ""I may be tough on border security, but not that tough."" Building a wall on the border with Mexico is one of Mr Trump's main policy objectives. The construction of the wall has now begun, with the Pentagon allocating $3.6bn (£2.9bn) of military funding towards its development. What are the authors' claims? The book - called Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration, by reporters Michael Shear and Julie Davis, and based on interviews with more than a dozen unnamed officials - was published by the New York Times. It chronicles a week in March 2019 when Mr Trump reportedly tried to halt all southern migration to the US. According to an excerpt, the president privately suggested to aides that soldiers shoot migrants in the legs, but he was told it would be illegal. Previously, Mr Trump had made a public statement suggesting soldiers shoot migrants who throw rocks. Mr Trump suggested other extreme measures, according to the book. ""Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh,"" reads the extract. The excerpt describes Mr Trump ordering aides to enforce a complete shutdown of the US-Mexico border by noon the following day, leaving advisers ""in a near panic"" and ""desperately"" trying to placate the president. ""Mr Trump's order to close the border was a decision point that touched off a frenzied week of presidential rages, round-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time,"" the excerpt says. Aides reportedly managed to change Mr Trump's idea of closing the border, but the president later pushed out a number of senior aides who he believed were frustrating his immigration crackdown, including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Follow Maria's journey Share this chatbot. What's happening at the border? Mr Trump has made a crackdown on illegal migration a key priority of his presidency since his 2016 election campaign. The Republican president's stance has led to frequent run-ins with Democrats in Congress, with particular flashpoints including the conditions within migrant detention facilities and funding for the wall. In February, Mr Trump declared an emergency on the US-Mexico border to free up federal funding. In June, he signed a 90-day deal with Mexico aimed at reducing the flow of migrants crossing into the US. The deal involved initiatives like closer bilateral co-operation and Mexico deploying thousands of National Guard troops throughout the country. Last month, Mexico reported that it had successfully curbed the number of undocumented migrants crossing into the US by 56% since May. However, while figures show that illegal border crossings into the US have seen an overall decline since 2000, they have been rising again since Mr Trump took office. The current financial year has so far seen more than 800,000 people detained on the southern US border - already twice the total for 2018. Many of those arriving are fleeing violence or poverty and travel north through Mexico until they reach the US border.","US President Donald Trump suggested shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down, according to a new book."
"Vice-President Mike Pence said the three countries would work together on the facility on Manus Island. Australia announced last month that it would work with PNG to develop the island's Lombrum Naval Base. Mr Pence made the announcement on the sidelines of the Apec summit in the PNG capital, Port Moresby. ""The United States will partner with Papua New Guinea and Australia on their joint initiative at Lombrum Naval Base,"" he said. ""We will work with these two nations to protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific islands."" Lombrum, which was a major US naval base during World War Two, holds a strategic position overlooking busy trade routes. The US and Australia have a shared concern over China's increasing influence in the region. Reports earlier this year that Beijing was looking to build a permanent military base in the South Pacific alarmed both countries. Mr Pence did not elaborate on US plans for the Manus Island base or whether US ships would be permanently stationed there. He said the facility would show US commitment to an ""open and free Indo-Pacific"". ""Our commitment is to stand with countries across this region who are anxious to partner with us for security,"" he added. Australian defence minister Christopher Pyne has said some Australian ships would probably be based permanently at Lombrum, broadcaster ABC reported. Australia and the US are part of the ""Five Eyes"" Western intelligence alliance along with Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Earlier this month Australian PM Scott Morrison announced a multi-billion dollar fund for Pacific island nations to build infrastructure - another apparent attempt to counter Beijing. He said the project aimed to restore the Pacific to the ""front and centre"" of Australia's foreign outlook. China has been providing millions of dollars in loans for infrastructure projects in the region and has become the second-largest donor of foreign aid there behind Australia.","The US says it will join Australia in developing a naval base in Papua New Guinea (PNG), in an apparent move to curb China's growing influence."
"Beijing has been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry and it has taken many months of negotiations for the WHO to be allowed access to the city. The virus is thought to have come from a market in the city selling animals. But the search for the source has led to tensions, notably with the US. President Donald Trump's administration has accused China of trying to conceal the initial outbreak. What is the aim of the investigation? A biologist on the team travelling to Wuhan told the Associated Press news agency that the WHO was not seeking to apportion blame, but rather to prevent future outbreaks. ""It's really not about finding a guilty country,"" Fabian Leendertz of Germany's Robert Koch Institute said. ""It's about trying to understand what happened and then see if, based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future."" Dr Leendertz said the aim was to find out when the virus began circulating and whether or not it originated in Wuhan. The mission was expected to last four or five weeks, he added. Where and when was the virus first detected? In the early days of the virus, it was traced to a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan, Hubei province, and it was suggested that this was where it made the leap from animals to humans. But experts now believe it may simply have been amplified there. Research suggests that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. Last December, a Chinese doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital - Li Wenliang - tried to warn fellow medics about a possible outbreak of a new disease, but was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". Dr Li died in February after contracting the virus while treating patients in the city. In April, suspicions and allegations emerged that the virus might have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. US State Department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. Recent reports in Chinese media have suggested that Covid-19 could have started outside China. But analysts say the reports are without foundation, and the campaign reflects anxiety within the leadership in Beijing about damage to the country's international reputation from the pandemic. Will access to Wuhan provide answers? Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent The question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus has become embroiled in international geopolitics and rows about the WHO. The Trump administration has always taken a hard line, arguing that the WHO has been too soft on China and citing examples of officials praising the Chinese regime for its actions such as locking down Wuhan, mass testing and its publication of the genetic code of the virus. However, lots of other countries also said there needed to be a proper inquiry - including Australia and the UK. The Associated Press revealed transcripts of video calls from WHO officials complaining back in January that they had not received the right data they needed from the Chinese authorities. A two-man WHO team that visited China this summer had difficulty negotiating access to Wuhan. This trip, when it does happen, will probably concentrate on fundamental biological questions: did the virus originally come from bats? Was there an ""intermediate host"" linking bats to humans? And were Wuhan wet markets at the centre of the initial outbreak? What has been the response to China's reporting of the virus? China's tackling of the developing crisis was praised in January by the head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, who said the ""challenge is great but the response has been massive"". Beijing had helped slow the spread of the virus, the WHO said, by quickly volunteering to share its knowledge of the virus's genetic code. However, the US - among a number of other countries - raised questions about whether China was fully transparent when the virus first emerged there. In March, the head of the WHO in China, Dr Gauden Galea, told the BBC there were ""shortcomings"" in tackling the outbreak in the early days, but that experts would look at how issues could be avoided in the future. Mr Trump later attacked the WHO itself for being too ""China-centric"" in praising Beijing, saying the organisation ""really blew it"" with its early guidance during the outbreak. He announced that he was pulling the US out of the body and said funding would be redirected elsewhere. However, US President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on 20 January, has since set up a foreign policy team tasked with keeping America in the WHO.","A team of 10 international scientists will travel to the Chinese city of Wuhan next month to investigate the origins of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said."
"New York City, Portland and Seattle are on the list of ""anarchist cities"" that Trump officials say have failed to stem crime linked to a summer of protests. It follows a memo from Mr Trump earlier this month, threatening the move. The mayors of the cities have promised to sue, calling Mr Trump's move a political stunt. A statement from the justice department on Monday laid out recent crime rates in the cities and how their police responded. ""We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,"" Attorney General William Barr said in the statement. He also called on Portland, Seattle and New York City to ""reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens"". The department statement noted that these cities were highlighted as they meet key criteria, such as forbidding ""the police force from intervening to restore order amid widespread or sustained violence or destruction"", as well as seeking to disempower or defund police. Refusing to accept federal law enforcement assistance is also a factor. All three cities have seen major protests since the death of unarmed black man George Floyd in May. It remains unclear what federal funding may be cut from the cities. CNBC reports that some of the funds targeted by Mr Trump's memo comprise a large portion of New York City's annual budget, which has already been stretched thin by the pandemic. In a joint statement, the mayors of Portland, Seattle, New York and Washington DC - which was on a shortlist of ""anarchist cities"" but was not included in Monday's decision - accused Mr Trump of ""playing cheap political games with congressionally directed funds"". The mayors called the decision ""thoroughly political and unconstitutional"" and accused the Trump White House of ""shirking responsibility and placing blame elsewhere to cover its failure"". Violent crimes have generally declined in US cities since the 1990s, but have risen steeply in the past year in several cities including Philadelphia, Chicago and New York. What is happening in those cities? The move comes amid a summer of unrest sparked by protests against the police killing of black Americans. Some of the protests have led to major police reforms around the country. In New York City, the rate of shootings and murders has skyrocketed as youth programmes and other social organisations have been placed on hold due to the pandemic. Cases of looting and vandalism have also made national news as protests for racial justice have sometimes turned violent. Reacting to the justice department announcement on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the decision ""another one of President Trump's games"", adding: ""It's insulting to the people of New York City and his [Mr Trump's] effort to withhold our funding is unconstitutional."" Seattle permitted the establishment of a so-called ""autonomous zone"" where protesters forbade police from entering an area near the city centre for nearly a month. The zone was dismantled in early July after several shootings. Nightly protests have continued since. Portland, Oregon, has often been invoked by Mr Trump as a ""Democrat-run"" city that has supposedly allowed violence. Protests have continued nightly there for over 100 consecutive days, sometimes devolving to violence and vandalism as protesters fight with police. Trump's crackdown on Portland protests explained",The Trump administration has named three cities that could lose federal funding after the White House accused them of tolerating crime.
"Rob Roussel, senior project manager, said the natural treatment being used on the site was more effective in warmer weather. He said he hoped the oil would be eradicated by the end of the summer. However, Mr Roussel said it depended on how much more oil rose from the bottom of the quarry. Micro organisms, that feed on hydrocarbons, and enzymes are involved in the bioremediation process, which sees the oil turned into carbon dioxide and water. Mr Roussel said: ""We aerate the water to maximise their activity, they work better in the warmer weather. ""Two things slowed the process down, the cold snap we had in November and far more oil came up from the bottom than had been expected."" The oil was placed in the quarry in the Vale after 100,000 tons of crude oil from the Torrey Canyon tanker hit some of the island's westerly beaches. The 974ft (297m) vessel hit the the UK's south-west coast on 18 March 1967.","Clearance of oil from the Torrey Canyon quarry was slowed by the winter's cold snap, according to Guernsey's Public Services Department."
"Stephen Mills was visiting the Vermilion Heritage Museum with his family when he had a go at opening the iron box ""for a laugh"". The museum in the province of Alberta had previously tried numerous times to unlock the old safe - to no avail. The safe had not been opened since the late 1970s. The museum, housed in an old brick school building, hosts a collection on the history of Vermilion, a town of just over 4,000 people. Mr Mills, from Fort McMurray, Alberta, was visiting Vermilion with his extended family during a long weekend in May. ""When we go camping every summer, we've come to learn that every small town, no matter where you go, has something to offer,"" he told the BBC. So the family brought the children to see the museum and was given a tour by volunteer Tom Kibblewhite. One of the exhibits was a safe that had originally been in the town's Brunswick Hotel, which had opened in 1906. The safe itself is believed to have been bought in 1907. It was donated to the museum in the early 1990s after the hotel changed ownership and was renovated. Mr Mills said when they were shown the safe, the whole family ""was intrigued"". How did he do it? The museum had previously enlisted the help of experts to crack the code, tried default combinations, and had contacted former hotel employees to see if they could help. Like the Mills family, other museum visitors played around with trying to open it, with no success. You may also like: ""I said to [Mr Kibblewhite]: 'that's a crazy time capsule. You don't even know what's in it,'"" said Mr Mills, who works as a welder. He noticed the dial numbers ran from zero to 60, and decided to try 20-40-60. ""Typical combination lock, three times clockwise - 20 - two times counterclockwise - 40 - once clockwise - 60, tried the handle and it went,"" he said. ""I could tell it wasn't opened for a long time because some dust fell out from the locking mechanism."" Mr Kibblewhite told the BBC ""it was a thrill"" when he turned and saw the door swinging open. So what was in the safe? Sadly no treasure. It contained an old pay sheet and part of a restaurant order pad, dating from the late 1970s. The pad included receipts for a mushroom burger for C$1.50 ($1.12; £0.59) and a package of cigarettes for C$1.00. ""They have no value really, but they are of great interest to us. It gives us a little bit of idea of what the places were like in 1977, '78,"" said Mr Kibblewhite. What are the chances? The odds of Mr Mills correctly guessing the combination are pretty long, says the University of Toronto's Jeffrey Rosenthal, author of Knock on Wood: Luck, Chance, and the Meaning of Everything. He calculated the chance of correctly guessing the combination on one try as 1 in 216,000. (His calculation assumed the safe numbers actually ran from one to 60). But he noted that some combination locks allow for wiggle-room and if this one had a three-digit leeway, Mr Rosenthal put the chances at 1 in 8,000, ""which is still a small chance"". The fact that the combination was in a specific pattern and did not appear to be a random combination of numbers could also factor into a calculation of the odds, he added.","A Canadian man unlocked a safe that had sat unopened in a small museum for decades, cracking the code on his first try with a lucky guess."
"By Francis Ngwa NibaDouala Shortly after she was born in a ward in Ngousso, on the outskirts of Cameroon's capital, Yaounde, she was operated on for a bowel problem. The little girl made a quick recovery, but she and her mother Germaine Abeboulouguiye were unable to return home as the bill came to $600 (about £375). The government hospital refused to release them until the medical fee was settled. But the family was broke - Ms Abeboulouguiye was unemployed, her partner, who did have a job, had abandoned her when she became pregnant and her parents were retired, living by subsistence farming. ""There is a lot of stress and complications - the atmosphere is not good to help raise a baby,"" Ms Abeboulouguiye told the BBC during her detention. Ms Abeboulouguiye's mother came to visit at the time - bringing food and other essentials, but otherwise they were prevented from leaving the hospital. When Cameroon's Le Jour newspaper reported their case, it caused outrage in Cameroon and a local charity intervened and paid part of the bill. The authorities, embarrassed by the furore, waived the rest of the fee and mother and baby were finally allowed home after 11 months of detention in a white-walled hospital ward. They are the most extreme case of the government's policy to get patients to help fund healthcare. It makes up about 70% of the hospital budgets - and patients are expected to cover the rest. Some free services are carried out, like malaria diagnosis for children under five. 'Held back' But now it is common for patients who cannot pay their bills for other treatments to be detained until their relatives pay up some or all of the debt. It was not a government policy that was ever announced, but it has come in gradually over the last five years. Three weeks after Mary Akwa was admitted to Buea Regional Hospital for a stomach problem she was unable to find money for her bill. ""If my family members can't help, where else should I turn to?"" she asked, clearly distressed. The health authorities in Cameroon declined to comment on the allegations. A doctor at Hospital Laquintinie in the commercial capital Douala, says the government policy brings with it difficult choices - and sometimes treatment is withheld. ""If patients don't pay me, I can't treat them,"" he told the BBC, requesting anonymity. However, Dr George Enow Orock, director of Buea Regional Hospital, says while some patients may be ""held back"" to pay their bills they are never denied assistance. ""[We will] do something to cater for somebody dangling between life and death,"" he said. ""It is our obligation to care for citizens."" Security at government hospitals has been tightened over the last five years, with high walls, fences and gates erected at institutions across the country. Private and public security guards have been drafted in - usually on duty at the gates to ensure no patient escapes without paying their bill. 'Escaped' ""We check patients before they leave the hospital premises if they have paid all the necessary dues. We check the various receipts and ensure that they are authentic,"" says Samuel Njie, a guard at Buea Regional Hospital. ""We've had cases of patients who have escaped from the hospital without our knowledge."" Some religious or mission hospitals and private clinics, which receive a small government subsidy, operate a similar policy in order to cover their costs. But instead of expecting patients to pay, some ask them to work in lieu of their bill. A tall man in Yaounde, who asked to remain anonymous, told me he was detained until July in a mission hospital in the north-west of Cameroon for six months. He said he had contracted typhoid fever and gone to a Catholic hospital for treatment. After the little money he had on him ran out, he was told he would have to work off the rest of his medical fees. ""I worked for six long months to pay off that bill,"" he said. ""Cleaning, washing plates, gardening - any odd job that cropped up. ""There was nothing I could do about it."" With the average Cameroonian surviving on less than $1 a day, some people prefer visiting traditional doctors when they get sick. When a patient cannot pay for their treatment in cash, traditional practitioners allow them to pay in kind. One traditional doctor in Buea told me the most popular items people use to pay their bills are fowls, goats and other things easily available in rural areas. It is an option Germaine's mother, Mrs Abeboulouguiye, wished she could have used to settle her daughter and granddaughter's bill. ""For the first time in my life I could not help my daughter. They kept asking me to bring money to pay - even when I said I had no money.""",Estelle Koulman has recently celebrated her first birthday - and her first taste of freedom as she spent the first 11 months of her life imprisoned - in a Cameroonian hospital.
"Protesters have maintained that Jamar Clark, 24, was restrained by police when they shot him on Sunday. Clark was placed on life support and died a day later. The shooting has led to protests in the mid-western city, with police and demonstrators using irritant spray against each other on Wednesday night. Police say that Clark was the suspect in an assault case and was interfering with medics who were working on the assault victim when he was shot. Lt Bob Kroll, the head of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis told the Associated Press news agency: ""Cuffs were never on."" Since the shooting authorities have remained largely silent on the issue, with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension - the agency investigating the shooting - saying that it was one line of investigation. Mr Kroll also said that Clark had ""a violent history"" and that the two officers who were involved in the shooting have no disciplinary issues on their records. Demonstrations continued on Wednesday night, with police telling local media that officers sustained minor injuries and some squad cars receiving ""significant damage"" from bricks. A number of high-profile police shootings of black people have sparked protests nationwide in recent months about the police use of excessive force against African Americans.",The Minneapolis police union has said that an unarmed black man was not handcuffed and was trying to disarm police when he was fatally shot.
"It is family day at Jessup Correctional Institution and the gym is full of women dressed in grey prison uniforms. They are sitting at tables nervously awaiting the arrival of their children. Among them is 27-year-old Latasha Shelton, who cannot stay still and keeps looking up at the windows to see any sign of her six-year-old daughter. ""I'm so excited,"" she says. Quite Shelton - her first name pronounced ""Cutie"" - is dressed in a tartan dress and has beads in her hair. She runs the entire length of the gym to reach her mother. Ms Shelton scoops her daughter up and swings her round in the air, while Quite squeals with delight. Once settled on her mother's lap, Quite sings to her. But Quite has not just come to visit her mother. Her grandmother, Starletta, is also serving time at Jessup, where the two women share a cell. Drug connection Ms Shelton and her mother were found guilty of attempted robbery three-and-a-half years ago. Starletta was addicted to crack cocaine at the time and tried to steal an elderly woman's purse from a shopping cart. Latasha was also in the store at the time. She panicked and drove her mother away. Although neither was armed, they each got nine-year prison sentences. ""My drug addiction played a big part in me being incarcerated,"" says Starletta. ""A lot of women that's in here are addicted to drugs - they suffer from depression. I think that they should get help instead of being incarcerated,"" she adds. ""When they go home, they are gonna commit the same crime over again - and they just keep coming back. Recidivism, that's what they call it."" Despite the fact that African Americans make up only 30% of the population of Maryland, the overwhelming majority of women at Jessup are black - and so, as is the case nationally, it is black children that suffer most from America's incarceration rate. One in nine African-American children now has a parent behind bars. Racial imbalances America's incarceration rate has quadrupled since 1970, making it five times the level in Britain and 12 times that of Japan. Becky Pettit, who recently co-authored a study on the impact of incarceration on families and economic mobility, says that there is no single explanation for why some groups have higher incarceration rates than others. But her study, published by the Pew Charitable Trust, indicates racial imbalances are exacerbated by incarceration: more than 35% of all African-American high school drop-outs aged 20 to 34 have served some form of criminal sentence, but that applies to less than 13% of white high school drop-outs in the same age range. ""Sentencing and prosecution politics have contributed to the rise in incarceration rates. And there's a close link between incarceration and social inequality,"" says Ms Pettit, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Washington. These trends have been intensified by the disproportionate impact of the ""war on drugs"", in which three-quarters of those in prison for drug offences are ethnic minorities, according to the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group. Many states have mandatory minimum sentences, which remove judges' discretion to show mercy. ""Three strikes"" laws, which were first introduced to lock-up violent repeat offenders for life, have, in several states, been applied to petty criminals. The war on drugs has often led to harsh sentences not just for dealing illegal drugs, but also for selling prescription drugs illegally. At the Jessup prison Christmas party, Alfreda Robinson helps hand out presents to the children. Ms Robinson, who runs the National Women's Prison Project, is worried about the long-term effect the prison sentences are having on the children. ""We've got an angry group of kids - growing up not knowing how to deal with their displaced feelings,"" she says. ""We've got kids bottling everything up and not talking about it. They're gonna be our adults, and they're gonna explode one day if we don't begin to get them the help they need."" Lasting effects As Quite sits on her mother's lap and gets her face painted by one of the prison volunteers, she doesn't look like a troubled child, but it is hard to believe that her upbringing will not leave a scar. Not only has she been separated from her mother and grandmother for more than three years, but she has also lost her father. He was a Baltimore drug dealer who was imprisoned and then murdered. Without parents to watch over her, it is left to a godmother and Quite's widowed 76-year-old great-grandfather, James Jones, to take care of her. Mr Jones also looks after three of Starletta's children and appears overwhelmed at his cramped East Baltimore home. ""It takes a toll,"" he says. He thinks Quite is smart and that gives him hope. But he admits there are times when she and the other children struggle. ""The younger ones understand their mother's away, they know she did something wrong but they don't fully understand why,"" Mr Jones says. ""They lash out and there are times when they're really hurting."" At Jessup prison, the children are saying their goodbyes after three precious hours spent with their mothers. Quite is struggling out the door with a gift bag almost as big as she is. A moment later, she appears at a window and, with a big grin on her face, she waves to her mother. Latasha joins the other women to get ready for a strip search. By the time they get back to their cells, many will be in tears, a prison officer says.","This Christmas, more children in America than ever before will have a parent behind bars. The BBC's Zoe Conway visits a women's prison near Baltimore in Maryland to find out how one family is coping with the separation."
"Mr Valls said the Socialists were dead and ""I will be a candidate for the presidential majority"". Party officials reacted warily, saying he had 24 hours to sign up. Emmanuel Macron won the presidency on Sunday and his new party has begun picking candidates for the June vote. The party, which has changed its name from En Marche (On the move) to La République en Marche, intends to have a list of candidates ready for the June vote by Thursday, drawn up from across French politics and civil society. It was only created 13 months ago and has no representatives in the National Assembly. Mr Valls resigned as prime minister when he stood unsuccessfully in the race to be Socialist presidential candidate and later backed Mr Macron to be president. However, his approach on Tuesday was not immediately welcomed with open arms. Macron spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, told French radio that Mr Valls had not yet been registered as a candidate by the party. ""He should have applied like everyone else because the rules are the same for everyone. If you don't put your name forward you can't be selected by En Marche. He's got 24 hours,"" he said. Mr Macron won 66.1% of the vote on Sunday, while far-right opponent Marine Le Pen attracted 33.9% of the vote. A quarter of the population abstained in the election and more than 11% either cast blank votes or spoilt their ballot. 'Treachery' at the heart of the Socialists Mr Valls's assertion that the Socialists were dead prompted anger from party colleagues. ""I hope for France's sake that Brutus and Judas don't seek En Marche's party nomination,"" said Socialist MP Alexis Bachelay. And the former prime minister's interview came hours after an eye-opening fly-on-the-wall TV documentary on Mr Macron's campaign. The programme showed the next president back in December describing Mr Valls's actions towards President François Hollande as ""a real betrayal"", shortly after Mr Hollande announced he would not run for a second term in office. Mr Macron says in Behind the Scenes of a Victory that while he himself had left the government to avoid being party to the cynicism at the heart of the government, Mr Valls had remained and brought the president down from within. ""If there is traitor, someone who has pulled the trigger on Hollande, it's Valls,"" he says. The man who beat Mr Valls to the Socialist candidacy, Benoît Hamon, was all but wiped out in the first round of the presidential election, winning just 6.36% of the vote. Seen as a notorious party rebel, he had attracted little support from the Socialist leadership. The timing of Mr Valls's comments was incendiary, shortly before the Socialists held a national meeting in an attempt to regroup after their electoral failure. Macron: The days ahead 9 May: Mr Macron will mark the EU's Europe Day, the annual celebration of peace and unity in Europe. In his victory speeches on Sunday he focused on the need for a strong Europe 10 May: Marks France's Slavery Remembrance Day, then in the afternoon attends the funeral of Corinne Erhel, the legislator who collapsed and died while speaking at a Macron rally last Friday.

"Sunday's missile launch was a successful one and it demonstrated North Korea's longest-range nuclear-capable weapon yet. Accompanying photographs showed it to be the same missile on parade last month at a massive military parade to mark the birth anniversary of North Korea's founding father Kim Il-sung. Current leader Kim Jong-un was on-site according to photos released from North Korean state media KCNA and Rodong Sinmun. In the hours afterwards, the statistics of the launch perplexed some observers, even to the point of questioning the data. With tensions high, US Pacific Command was careful to categorise the flight as ""not consistent with an intercontinental ballistic missile"", which is - in short - one which could reach the US mainland. One step further This ""mystery"" missile is now revealed to be a powerful intermediate range missile, which North Korea claims can deliver a large and heavy nuclear warhead. This vague statement leaves the door open to a range of possibilities, including that North Korea has not been able to make a compact warhead, or even that a new warhead will be revealed in the future. North Korean state media said the missile had been launched over the country and into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula 787km (489 miles) away from its launch site near Kusong. It reached an altitude of 2,111.1km according to KCNA. These figures fit approximately with statements made by both American and Japanese officials monitoring the situation. While unusual, this sharp trajectory with an extremely high altitude allowed North Korean scientists to test the range of the missile without directly flying over any neighbouring countries. The altitude would also allow the North to test the atmospheric re-entry vehicle under the extreme heat, pressure and vibration. The KCNA noted both facts in its public statement on Monday. This ""lofted"" trajectory would be equivalent to over 4,500km if launched at a standard trajectory, putting US bases in Guam well in range. It is indeed the longest-range missile North Korea has ever tested (aside from its space launch vehicles). Deeply disturbing Photographs indicate the Hwasong-12 to be a single stage, liquid-fuelled rocket, which would be unusually inefficient at this range due to the weight of the frame, fuel and oxidisers. One possibility is that the body of the rocket is intended to be one part of a larger multi-staged intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching well into the US mainland. In this way, North Korea can make iterative progress towards an ICBM without immediately crossing Trump's red line. The missile launch, occurring just days after the new South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office, is deeply disturbing to many observers. Missile testing under Kim Jong-un increased dramatically compared with his father and grandfather's programmes. This test marks the 10th test of 2017, and this particular missile shows a greater range than any other tested in its military programme. South Korea's new president has espoused dialogue with North Korea, and is now forced to take a tougher line just days into his administration. So once again North Korea, with its rapidly advancing missile technology and the decline in relations with its neighbours, including China, has left diplomats scratching their heads. Melissa Hanham is a Senior Research Associate in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, USA.","North Korea has said that the rocket it fired early on Sunday, was a new ballistic missile called the Hwasong-12. Defence expert Melissa Hanham explains what it tells us about Pyongyang's military strides."
"The blast in the University Town area left about 10 others injured. Reports said the bomber blew himself up after being stopped at a security post. A group allied to the Pakistani Taliban claimed the attack, saying it would attack Shias everywhere. Sectarian violence is on the rise in Pakistan but attacks on Iranian targets are rare. Neighbouring Iran, which is predominantly Shia, condemned the bombing. Its foreign ministry urged regional countries to co-operate closely to combat the ""spread of terror acts and extremism"".","Two Pakistani security guards have been killed in a suspected suicide bombing outside the Iranian consulate in the city of Peshawar, police say."
"Carrie GracieChina editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter Hangzhou on the eve of the G20 is a certain kind of awesome. A city rebuilt. Filled with brand new security kit and locked down manhole covers, it has been emptied of a third of its population. The switch was flicked to off in factories for hundreds of miles around, the pollution haze dispersed and the sky turned 'G20 blue'. This weekend's G20 is a demonstration that the one party state decides on a goal, it can call the country to attention and command its people to get behind it. Bid for economic leadership The G20 really matters to China. Since the first such summit in Washington in late 2008, these occasions have mostly been forgettable. But that year was a watershed for the Chinese leadership. With the global financial crisis, Beijing stopped believing there was something immutable and dependable about the way the western powers had wired the global economy. Talking points The summit explained - in dolls G20 warns Brexit adds to global economic risks China calls on G20 to lead over global economy Why is the South China Sea contentious? China's Island Factory As others floundered, China began its lightning move up the GDP hierarchy to second place, and simultaneously launched a campaign to move from outsider to central player in global economic governance. Despite the slower growth of recent months, Chinese purpose has not wavered. In fact, events since have only strengthened the conviction that economic power is moving east, and that this, if not the Asian century, is at least China's century. The list of evidence for this faith is long and conveniently includes Hangzhou's own global brands. Eight years ago, most foreigners would have been hard pressed to name any Chinese company, but now this city alone is home to several giants, including Alibaba. They are among China's corporate miracles which have worked out how to leverage an immense domestic market, hungry workforce and almost limitless capital, while absorbing abroad whatever growth nutrients they are missing at home. So this week's PR narrative around the G20 host city is a Hangzhou which balances a glorious imperial past with a glorious innovative future. The sharper strategic narrative around China's G20 moment is about the decline of the West, which began with the 2008 financial crisis, but is now gathering pace amid the distractions of a US presidential election and the disarray in Europe over Brexit, migrants and recession. In this triumphal narrative, only China is a reliable engine of growth, its politics less populist, its leadership farsighted. And according to the official New China News Agency, it is now time to take that leadership global. The host is ready to share its time-honoured wisdom and up-to-date solutions with the world. Put bluntly, China hopes the world will look back and identify the Hangzhou G20 as the moment when China looked like a better guardian of global economic governance than a US paralysed by poisonous politics at home and handicapped by distractions abroad. China's dilemma But will the Hangzhou summit be remembered like that? Will it be remembered at all? After all, leaders have to lead and this is hard for China on economic issues, let alone security. At a time of struggling growth and protectionist backlash across the world, President Xi will try to present himself in Superman pants, urging his guests to defend free trade for the sake of all our futures. But talk is cheap. Many of those in President Xi's audience have been complaining of Chinese protectionism for decades, the joke among their trade negotiators that for China the slogan win/win means heads I win, tails you lose. Certainly China has been a great beneficiary of globalisation and the commitment of others to free trade. It would have much to lose if the rest of the world started closing its markets. But both the German ambassador to China and the European Union Chamber of Commerce complained only this week that their companies face an unlevel playing field in China and that some feel ever less welcome. There is no sign of a last minute Superman-style intervention that might translate Chinese talk about free trade into spectacular action. Meanwhile the theme for China's summit is ""Towards an Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy"". But as well as being the master of top down mobilisation, China is often the master of meaning-light slogans. What would really help an innovative and invigorated global economy is fundamental structural reform from China, the dismantling of large parts of the sclerotic and monopolistic state owned economy. A dramatically freer Chinese economy with fair access to key sectors for private enterprise and foreigners would enormously enhance China's credibility as a leader on global governance. It stands to reason that if you play by fair rules, you have got a better chance of being invited to set them. But it will not happen or will not happen fast because of perceived political risk. A freer economy would get in the way of the Party's number one objective, political control. And this desperate political fragility has other painful consequences for China's dream of leadership. Exactly a year ago, the last huge international set piece in China was a giant military parade to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Japan in WWII. Many of the world leaders now gathering in Hangzhou were invited to attend that too, but most stayed away because the exercise was framed in a narrative of China's historical victimhood and 21st century return to greatness. It was a hard power message calculated to unite the domestic audience firmly behind the Communist Party. But by moving towards an increasingly strident nationalism complete with territorial ambitions and military build up, Beijing has placed itself in a zero sum leadership dilemma. It can either lead at home or it can lead abroad but without a more liberal political agenda, it cannot do both. In a region, where so many nations still have wounds from history, China's nationalist politics are toxic to its hopes to lead internationally. In July, Beijing's furious denunciation of an international court ruling on the South China Sea put it on the wrong side of international law. And if there are no accepted rules of the game, then the game is not about leadership but about my will against yours and ultimately about brute force. When you resort to that game, Superman pants can only be worn in the privacy of your own home. All those gathered for the G20 are keenly aware of these realities. They will note the slogans, the songs and the speeches. But when we look back in years to come and remember the Hangzhou summit, I suspect we will still be remembering the awesome mobilisation involved. China has not yet found the language to lead a troubled world.",China mobilises for a big event like nowhere else.

"Omar Khadr spent his youth between Canada, where he was born, and Pakistan, where his father had interests. Ostensibly those interests were supporting charity work in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but according to the US government, Ahmed Said Khadr was a senior al-Qaeda member and helped fund terrorist training camps. He was arrested in 1994 in connection with the bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan. The family moved to Jalalabad in Afghanistan in 1996, and the US alleges that the family had regular encounters with Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders. In the summer of 2002, according to US intelligence, Omar Khadr received personal weapons training and was subsequently part of a unit that turned landmines into homemade bombs. In July of that year, the then 15-year-old was captured during a clash between US and Afghan soldiers, and a small group of militants. Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade that killed a US soldier and injured another. He was shot and seriously wounded in the aftermath. Khadr's father was killed in Pakistan in 2003. His brother Abdullah was held for five years in Canada on US charges of supplying weapons to al-Qaeda, before being freed when a judge said he should not be extradited. Khadr himself ended up in Guantanamo Bay. He and his supporters have complained about ill-treatment for several years. Boycotting his tribunal in 2006, Khadr said he had been held in solitary confinement for long periods. His lawyers have also argued that trying him for crimes allegedly committed as a juvenile violates international law. They also said statements given by him were extracted with the use of indirect threats of rape and death. The second person to face terrorism charges under the tribunal system, Khadr was charged in 2007 with murder and attempted murder, conspiracy, providing support to terrorism and spying. The charges were thrown out by a US military judge two months later, prompting an appeal by the Pentagon. A military appeals court agreed that Khadr was designated an ""unlawful enemy combatant"" and that charges could proceed. Canada's Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the government should have not handed over documents from Canadian interrogations of Khadr to the US. In a video, released in 2008, showing Khadr being questioned by Canadian officials, the detainee complains of being denied access to proper medical treatment. In one section of the video an apparently disturbed Khadr repeatedly moans a phrase that sounds like ""help me"" or ""kill me"". Khadr was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison by a US military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay in 2010 on war crimes charges - having pleaded guilty to killing the soldier. But as part of his plea deal, his sentence was limited to eight years, and under the deal, he became eligible to return to Canada last October, before being eventually returned at the end of September 2012.","The son of an alleged close associate of Osama Bin Laden, Omar Khadr was drawn into militant circles before becoming a cause celebre for opponents of Guantanamo Bay."
"The announcement ends a ban on political campaigning brought in when the military ousted the elected government in a coup four years ago. The military has always insisted it intends to restore democracy in Thailand. But the election date has been pushed back repeatedly. The military took power in Thailand in 2014, overthrowing the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the hugely popular Pheu Thai party. Military leaders said at the time they were restoring order after months of political unrest which had at times turned violent. They later drew up a new constitution and changes to the electoral system, which were approved by the public in a referendum in 2017. The constitution effectively ensures that even after the election, the military will remain an influential force in politics. It will be able to appoint the senate, which in turn will help choose the next prime minister. Dozens of people have been detained and charged since the military banned political activity and gatherings of more than five people in an attempt to prevent more of the frequent large scale protests seen over the years. But an announcement on Tuesday said political parties ""should be able to campaign to present their policies"" so the junta had ""decided to amend or abolish the laws"". Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy - and the introduction of the first constitution - in 1932. It has promised not to intervene after the next elections but has already delayed them several times. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the new electoral system has been drawn up in a way that clearly disadvantages Pheu Thai, the strongest party in the country for two decades. The party remains closely linked to its previous ousted leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile after being convicted of corruption. Much will depend on how well popular support for the party has held up under military rule, says our correspondent. If it does well enough in the election, it may try to form a government, despite likely resistance from the military.",Thailand's military government has said political parties are free to start campaigning ahead of a long-awaited election scheduled for 24 February.
"Government official Cosma Wilungula said Friday's attack was the deadliest in recent history. He said about 60 militiamen had ambushed a convoy of civilians that was being protected by the rangers. Africa's oldest nature reserve is a popular tourist attraction, known for its population of mountain gorillas. The biologically diverse park is a Unesco World Heritage site in the restive east of the DR Congo. Another six people were injured in the attack blamed on militiamen from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose leaders have been accused of links to the 1994 genocide in which some 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. The group has so far made no public comments on the accusations against it. A statement on the park's website said there were indications that this was an attack on the local civilian population. ""Virunga Park Rangers were not the target of the assault, but lost their lives responding to the attack in defence of the local population,"" the statement said. Kidnappers have been known to target tourists in the park. In 2018 attackers killed park ranger Rachel Masika Baraka during the brief kidnapping of two British tourists and their driver. The park closed to tourists on 23 March following advice from experts that gorillas might be vulnerable to complications from catching Covid-19.",At least 12 rangers have been killed by suspected members of a Rwandan rebel group in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"By Sarah RainsfordBBC News, Moscow He was among a record 4,002 people arrested across Russia last week, as large crowds took to the streets to demand the release of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Further protests have been called for Sunday, threatening to strain the system even further. ""We didn't sleep all night. One person always had to stand for space, so we took it in turns,"" Filip told me by phone on Wednesday from the back of the police van, which he described as an ""ancient vehicle with metal bars all round"". Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, fiercely critical of the Kremlin, was imprisoned on his recent return to Russia after recovering from an attempt to kill him with a nerve agent. A judge had sentenced Filip to 10 days in custody on Monday for his part in the protest. But it took police a further two days to find space in city cells. By the time we spoke, his group had been waiting outside Moscow Detention Centre No 2 for 17 hours, fed only by volunteers who brought sandwiches to the van. 'Anyone could be next' Filip, a small-business owner, is not a fan or follower of Mr Navalny, but he is disturbed by how a fellow citizen is being treated. ""They're punishing him for nothing - which means anyone could be next, including me,"" he explained. Few protesters we spoke to at Moscow's Pushkin Square last Saturday mentioned Mr Navalny's near-fatal poisoning, but all were shocked at how his flight home had been diverted so he could be detained at the border. He then faced a bizarre, makeshift court hearing in a police station. One poll suggests as many as 42% in the Moscow crowd were moved to protest for the first time. The rallies were also unprecedented in their spread, covering towns and cities usually seen as politically ""passive"". ""In Moscow, we have safety in numbers, places to work if we get fired, but in the regions it's much more constricted,"" political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann points out. ""People there take higher risks."" 'In the regions people are much angrier' In Vladivostok, Russia's far east, Mr Navalny's team say there haven't been demonstrations in the city on last Saturday's scale for over a decade. Katerina Ostapenko, his local co-ordinator there, did not take part herself: she was picked up by police the day before. But she says up to 3,000 people came out, motivated partly by Navalny's latest video exposé: a corruption investigation targeting President Vladimir Putin himself. The film claimed that Mr Putin had a secret, opulent palace built for him on the Black Sea, complete with an aqua-disco and a pole-dancing salon. ""I think people in the regions are much angrier and that's why so many protested,"" Ms Ostapenko told me. ""They're really angry because they have no money, and now look how much Putin has! And it's our tax money that paid for his palace."" Vladimir Putin has denied any link to the giant property in Gelendzhik, calling the film a poor montage meant to brainwash people. It's already been watched on YouTube more than 100 million times. ""The number of views is staggering,"" Ekaterina Schulmann says, arguing that the scale of subsequent protests reflects deepening discontent here. ""[There's] the year of lockdown measures, the frustration and weariness collected inside people in that time, and the ongoing economic stagnation and declining incomes,"" she notes, adding that Mr Putin's trust rating has been sliding since his re-election two years ago. ""We are in a turbulent period."" So, unsurprisingly, the response to Saturday's protest has been swift and hard. After rounding up thousands of protesters on the day, issuing fines or short-term detention, officials are now going after key allies of Alexei Navalny including his brother, doctor, and a lawyer at his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Police in black balaclavas, armed with crowbars, launched raids at their flats and offices across Moscow, as a criminal case was opened for calling a protest mid-pandemic. The fact that Moscow's mayor just lifted a curfew on bars and nightclubs, claiming that Covid-19 is in retreat, made no difference. On Friday, a court placed the three under house arrest for two months, barred from using the internet, while the investigation continues. The Kremlin spokesman denies the prosecutions are politically motivated, telling journalists that law enforcement officers are ""just doing their job"". But with another day of demonstrations ahead, the authorities clearly want to remove the ringleaders. 'We have to protest' The crackdown may well shrink the crowd this weekend: criminal cases have been launched against ordinary protesters, too - serious charges, including violence against police and hooliganism. But many have vowed to come out regardless. ""We share one problem, the way we're governed,"" Danya says - a student who was detained last Saturday along with several friends. ""We're all protesting for one thing: the alternation of power."" His friend Kirill says their group were standing quietly when the police ""flew at us and started to beat us with their batons"". ""I'm not a direct supporter of Navalny,"" Kirill explains, but he considers his treatment ""illegal"". ""So as citizens of a country we love and want to be better, we have to protest."" One person who definitely won't join him is Filip Kuznetsov, who still has several days of his sentence left to run. But on Friday he sent word that he and other protesters were being moved ""at great haste"". ""They're making space for the protest on the 31st,"" he messaged me, before being bundled into another police van and driven to a detention centre for illegal migrants 100km (60 miles) out of town.",Filip Kuznetsov spent an entire night crammed into a police van with 17 other protesters because Moscow's detention centres were all full.
"The grassroots movement - ""gilets jaunes"" in French - grew out of fuel tax protests in November. Topping the list is Ingrid Levavasseur, 31, a care worker raising two children alone in Normandy. She accuses the government of arrogance. During the protests Paris has seen its most serious street clashes since 1968. The movement embraces a wide range of people, some of whom reject any association with the current political set-up in France and the EU. In general they see President Emmanuel Macron as a symbol of traditional French elitism, remote from the hardships of ordinary people struggling to cope with utility bills, fuel taxes, low pay and unemployment. In December Mr Macron scrapped a planned fuel tax rise, as the protests continued to grip France. Who is on the candidate list? They range in age from 29 to 53, and have a variety of backgrounds, including a small business manager, a lawyer, another care worker and a full-time mother. Six are women and four men. They call themselves the ""Citizen-led Rally"", or RIC, and the campaign will be run by another prominent activist, Hayc Shahinyan. But so far the movement has avoided picking one leader. They aim to boost their candidate list to 79 by 10 February. Those candidates will be selected through a vote by yellow-vest activists. They will be competing for 79 seats allocated to France in the European Parliament, though that figure might yet change because of the UK's uncertain Brexit timetable. RIC needs to raise at least €700,000 (£609,000; $794,000) to field candidates, the French daily Le Figaro reports. Mr Shahinyan says RIC has about 10% of that figure so far, so it will appeal for donations and may try crowdfunding. In an indication of its platform, RIC said it rejected ""the decisions of European institutions and diktats from the financial and technocrat classes, who have forgotten what really matters: humanity, solidarity and the planet"". It vowed to be ""spokesperson for the citizens, who will be consulted throughout the mandate"". How has President Macron reacted to the protests? Besides scrapping the fuel tax rise Mr Macron promised an extra €100 (£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. The package aimed at defusing the crisis will cost €10bn (£9bn; $11bn), the government says. Mr Macron has also launched a national ""Grand Debate"", involving town-hall meetings nationwide to address the protesters' concerns. On Thursday Paris City Hall was hosting a 12-hour debate, while Mr Macron was meeting conservative opposition leader Laurent Wauquiez and local mayors in Valence, south-eastern France. What can be expected in the European elections? Nationalists and populists have made big gains across the EU in recent years, so they are likely to boost their representation in the European Parliament. Italy has a populist Five Star/League coalition government, in Germany the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the main opposition party and nationalists are in power in Hungary and Poland. The EU's proportional representation voting system can be advantageous for smaller parties. An example is the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP), which has seven MEPs in Strasbourg but no MPs at Westminster. According to an Elabe opinion poll published on Wednesday, Mr Macron's liberal La République en Marche (Republic on the move) is on course to win the 26 May election in France, followed by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) and the yellow vests, on 13%. The European Parliament is reducing its total of MEPs because of Brexit, from 751 to 705. Without the UK, there are 73 fewer seats, but 27 are being reallocated to other countries. France's total rises from 74 to 79. The plans could change, however, as it is still unclear whether the UK will leave the EU as scheduled on 29 March. Italy's populist deputy prime ministers, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, have sharply criticised Mr Macron and voiced support for the yellow vests. French Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau hit back on Wednesday, saying ""we won't enter into a stupidity contest"". She warned that for the time being France would not send ministers on visits to Italy.","The yellow-vest protest movement in France has named 10 candidates for the May European Parliament elections, but says it aims to expand the list to 79."
"Western countries, such as the UK and France, are starting to tap into the trend by wooing Chinese visitors with simplified visa applications. Rapid urbanisation, increased disposable income and a relaxing of travel restrictions have enabled more people to travel and budget airlines are opening up routes from India and other parts of Asia. Asians travelling outside the region every year The Chinese are taking the lead. China sits in third place behind France and the United States as a travel destination for the world's tourists, but millions of Chinese are now travelling abroad themselves. International trips by Chinese travellers have grown from 10 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2012, according to the World Tourism Organization UNWTO. Some analysts predict more than 100 million travellers will leave mainland China in the next 12 months - and when they travel, they spend. Chinese travellers spent a record $102bn in international tourism in 2012, up 40% from 2011. That's more than the total for American or German visitors. In the first three quarters of 2013, China's expenditure increased by 28%. How Asians rank among top travel spenders The COTRI China Outbound Tourism Research Institute says the ""New Chinese Tourists"" are travel-savvy, well-educated and mostly under 45 years of age. COTRI's latest estimate is that Chinese travellers will spend a total $129 billion in the next 12 months, despite a slight slowdown in outbound travel compared with 2011/12. ""The new Chinese governments campaign against 'hedonism' and 'extravagance' will have some impact on official outbound travels which will however mostly be cancelled out by the growing demand for leisure trips especially from second- and third- tier cities in China,"" says COTRI's director Prof Dr Wolfgang Georg Arlt. The Hurun Report into Chinese luxury travellers found that wealthy Chinese were travelling overseas on business less frequently for the first time in five years. Reasons for travelling: Business or leisure? By 2030, North East Asia is expected to be the most visited destination in the world, although Europe will be the most popular in terms of international arrivals in relation to population size. A large proportion of the travellers between 2010 and 2030 will come from the Asia and Pacific region, according to UNWTO projections. Among the most popular destinations for Asian travellers are other Asian countries. The main destinations for departures from China are Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Thailand. Around 18.8 million visitors from mainland China visited Hong Kong in the first half of 2013, according to the local tourism board. The city's own population is only 7.1 million. Where do Asian travellers go? (2012) Chinese from the mainland are said to be attracted by the shopping - everything from luxury goods to baby formula - because Hong Kong has no sales tax and a reputation for authentic goods. Travel to the United States has increased dramatically over the past six years from around 397,600 trips a year to 1.4 million, but travel to Japan and the UK has fallen slightly. The Japan National Tourist Organization says the number of Japanese travellers to East Asian destinations such as Korea is still decreasing, with more Japanese travellers going to Vietnam, Thailand and Hawaii. Among the top five destinations for Indian travellers are Singapore, UAE and Malaysia. Journeys from India to Thailand since 2007 have increased by more than 50%. Euromonitor International says the South-east Asian destinations have been promoted aggressively by online travel agents and other via social media websites such as Facebook. Cheap deals meant outbound trips became more affordable to more Indian consumers, many of whom had never previously travelled outside the country. The number of outbound travellers from India is expected to grow exponentially over the next 20 years, say industry analysts Amadeus, with the 4.5 million Indians travelling to Asia-Pacific destinations in 2011, increasing to almost 70 million by 2030. Enticing travellers Traditional destinations in Europe and countries within Asia are making efforts to make travel from China, in particular, easier by simplifying visa applications. South Korea has removed the need for visas for Chinese travellers going directly to Jeju Island, allowed multiple-entry visas for teachers and offered benefits to timeshare owners. In return, Chinese arrivals have risen over the past five years. In Europe, Germany and France opened a joint visa processing centre in autumn 2012 to speed up visa processing. The UK, which boasts around 39 weekly services between London and four cities in China, has also announced a pilot scheme to allow selected Chinese travel agents to apply for UK visas by submitting the EU's Schengen visa form, rather than two separate applications, reducing duplication for agents taking tourists to both the UK and the Schengen area in Europe.","Continental shifts are being made in terms of travel, tourism and spending power as more Asian, and especially Chinese, travellers are venturing abroad."
"Katie Meyler, the CEO of charity More Than Me, announced she would step aside after a report by ProPublica and Time magazine revealed the abuse. More Than Me says they have taken steps to safeguard girls at the school, which is devoted to women's empowerment. The group has also created a panel to review the investigation. The non-governmental organisation's (NGO) advisory board recommended an independent investigation into allegations of widespread abuse and negligence at the institution, which exists to protect young Liberian girls from sexual abuse and exploitation. In a statement on Monday, a committee of seven Liberian government agencies said it met twice since the story was published on Thursday, with the aim ""to taking the appropriate legal actions to protect the children and ensure they are safe"", Time magazine reported. The NGO had received almost $600,000 (£456,000) from the US government, and Ms Meyler had been praised by celebrity philanthropists including Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. She had also received an invitation to the White House by former President Barack Obama. During the Ebola epidemic in 2014, western media organisations - including the BBC - profiled Ms Meyler and her Instagram account, where she documented the struggles of the Liberians she met. She was named among Time Magazine's 2014 Person of the Year, which was dedicated to the first responders to the Ebola crisis. More Than Me now runs 19 schools in Liberia, teaching approximately 4,000 students. What is the allegation? According to the investigative report, Ms Meyler entrusted a local man named Macintosh Johnson to recruit vulnerable young girls in the West Point slum of Liberia's capital Monrovia for her school, which opened in 2013. Johnson, who later died from AIDS in prison, was her main contact on the ground while she continued to live outside of Liberia for up to 10 months a year. According to police records, Johnson repeatedly raped several young girls under his care at his home and on school property. Of the 10 girls who testified against Johnson at the time, one tested positive for HIV, according to a statement from More Than Me's Liberian advisory board. After his arrest in 2014, no members of More Than Me attended the trial to testify against him, according to the report. The girls and their families reportedly feared going to charity administrators or public officials because they did not want to risk losing access to the charity's resources such as education, food and health services. The report claims that despite being made aware of the sexual abuse allegations at the school, Ms Meyler and charity officials ignored the crimes. One board member told ProPublica that Ms Meyler called him to say the allegations were ""really, really, really bad"", and perhaps involved ""all the girls over 11"" at the school. Ms Meyler spoke the following day at a Forbes summit on philanthropy where she called the academy ""the best school in Liberia"". What does the charity say? In a statement announcing her temporary resignation, Ms Myeler said: ""Over the past 10 years, it has been my life's work to serve in our mission to provide the most vulnerable girls of Liberia with a quality education and opportunities for advancement so they can have better lives. ""My first priority has always been to support these girls."" The organisation's board of directors denies the claims of negligence saying that they took ""swift and immediate"" action against Johnson - who they view as the sole wrongdoer - after the girls first revealed the sexual abuse. ""It is beyond disheartening and extremely sad to see ProPublica depict the organisation in such a decidedly one-sided, biased and inaccurate manner, and we vigorously deny their characterisation of our actions, or lack thereof,"" the board said in a statement. ""As an organisation whose enduring mission it is to support the most vulnerable girls in Liberia by getting them off the streets and into schools, More Than Me is deeply sorry that in 2013 and 2014, a former staff member who was recommended to us highly was able to exploit his position to commit sexual assault. ""We extend our sincerest apology to the survivors, and continue doing everything within our power to support them, their families and the community at large who have been impacted by this heinous crime.""",The CEO of a US-backed academy in Liberia has temporarily resigned after a report found that dozens of girls were allegedly raped by an employee.
"Police found traces of explosives, three handmade belts and a fingerprint of fugitive Salah Abdeslam. The apartment in the Schaerbeek district of Brussels had been rented in a false name that might have been used by a person already in custody. Islamic State (IS) suicide attackers killed 130 people in the attacks. Traces of the explosive TATP (acetone peroxide) and the belts, which could have been used to transport explosives, were found in the raid on 10 December in Rue Berge, the Belgian federal prosecutor's office said. The prosecutor's office told the BBC that Abdeslam's fingerprint was not dated, and it would be very hard to determine the date. Who were the Paris attackers? Paris attacks: The investigation so far Paris attacks: Who were the victims? Paris attacks: What happened on the night Prosecutors believe that the Schaerbeek flat was used only by the Belgium-based attackers who went to the apartment, got the explosive belts, and then went to Paris. However, they believe that Abdeslam, 26, did go back to the flat in Schaerbeek because he probably thought it would be the only place where he could be safe after the attacks. Their theory is that somebody drove him there, and dropped him not far from that Schaerbeek address, right after the Paris attacks. French police pulled over the VW Golf car he was travelling in with two others near Belgium, but then let the group continue their journey. Abdeslam is believed to have rented a VW Polo car in Belgium, which was later found near the Bataclan concert hall in Paris where 89 people were killed. But he also rented a Renault Clio and reserved two hotel rooms outside Paris before the attacks. His precise role in the attacks themselves is unclear. Although his brother Brahim blew himself up, Salah Abdeslam is thought to have played a logistical role. The Paris attacks are believed to have been at least partly planned in Brussels. Belgian police have arrested 10 people in the investigation, including one who rented the apartment in Schaerbeek. The district is central, just north of the EU institutions. Among the 10 held are Mohammed Amri et Hamza Attou, suspected of having brought Salah Abdeslam back to Brussels from Paris. Immediately after the attacks, the police focused their searches on Molenbeek, in western Brussels, where some of the attackers were known to have lived. The suspected ringleader was Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national. He and his cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen died in a fierce gun battle five days after the attacks, when police raided a flat in Paris where they were hiding, heavily armed. The search for Abdeslam",Belgian prosecutors believe they may have found a bomb factory also used as a hideout by one of the jihadists after the Paris attacks.
"At least 3,000 of them fled their homes in May after inter-communal clashes in north-eastern Ituri province. But they were unable to cross into Uganda to seek safety as the country had closed its borders in March to control the spread of coronavirus. It has been agreed the refugees will be quarantined before being settled. This will happen for 14 days at a new isolation centre, 13km (eight miles) from the border. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) says sample testing will be carried out on the group to see if coronavirus is present amongst them. This will help authorities decide when the refugees can be transferred to camps. Two border crossings in Uganda's Zombo district temporarily opened on Wednesday and it is expected all the refugees will be able to cross over in three days. Uganda hosts more than 1.4 million refugees - most have fled from South Sudan, while about 30% come from DR Congo. Aid agencies have talked about the difficulties of ensuring social distancing and sanitation in refugee settlements, BBC Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga reports. Fifty-two refugees have so far tested positive for Covid-19 in Uganda out of nearly 900 confirmed cases.

""UNHCR is receiving accounts of the way armed groups are unleashing terror on people as they flee, in displacement sites and hosting areas, and when they attempt to return, including reports of killings and mutilation, sexual violence and looting."" Why is there fighting in Ituri? Ethnic violence in gold-rich Ituri, involving the Lendu and Hema communities, has soared since March. At least 531 civilians have been killed by armed groups in the region between October and May, 375 of them since March, according to the UN. Human Rights Watch says much of the bloodshed has its roots in competition for control of gold mines, exploited for decades by rebels, politicians and military officials who smuggle the gold into neighbouring countries. UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet said in June that since 2017, the main armed group active in the region had been Codeco, mainly drawn from the Lendu community. She said it and other Lendu fighters had been pursuing a strategy of slaughtering local residents - mainly the Hema, but also the Alur - in order to control the region's natural resources. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has found several warlords guilty of war crimes committed in Ituri. In mid-March two of them - Thomas Lubanga, who led a Hema militia, and Germain Katanga, who led a Lendu one - were released by the Congolese government after serving their sentences.",Uganda has opened part of its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to allow in thousands of people stuck in no-man's land for more than a month.
"An agreement was reached between City Hall and the Jewish community after fragments were found in some of the city's pedestrian zones. Czech Jews have for years been calling for the removal of the stones. Fragments taken from a derelict 19th Century Jewish cemetery were used as cobbles during works in 1987. Most of the stones - made from gravestones that were cut into squares - are believed to be located at the base of Wenceslas Square, one of the city's main squares, and on Na Prikope, a popular shopping street. The Jewish Community will return any fragments to the Old Jewish Cemetery in the Zizkov district. Before World War Two, Czechoslovakia's Jewish population was about 350,000. In 1946, that number was about 50,000. By the late 1980s - around the time the gravestone fragments were used to cobble streets - the country's Jewish population barely numbered 8,000. Earlier this year, Leo Pavlat - director of the Jewish Museum in Prague - told the BBC ""it wasn't easy being Jewish back then"", referring to the Communist era. ""There were no publications, no education,"" he said. ""I think the regime just wanted the Jewish community to slowly die."" Now a project called ""Finding the Lost Face of Jewish Cemeteries"" is under way to identify the gravestone fragments, according to Radio Prague International.

"By Mina al-LamiBBC Monitoring While this is a major blow, the loss of the small enclave near the Iraqi border does not spell the end of IS as a militant group capable of mounting deadly attacks worldwide. IS and its affiliates continue to be active in various countries, claiming attacks on a daily basis through the group's online propaganda outlets. Data collected by BBC Monitoring shows that despite having lost most of its territory in Syria and Iraq at the end of 2017, IS said it was behind 3,670 attacks worldwide last year - an average of 11 attacks per day - and 502 attacks in the first two months of 2019, while Baghuz was under siege. There was a peak in IS attack claims in September 2018. This was likely to have been linked to the start that month of an operation by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance to take the IS stronghold of Hajin, north of Baghuz. The jihadist group commonly steps up its attacks in response to offensives against it, either in the area under siege or elsewhere to divert attention or resources away from there. Although Iraq and Syria continue to account for the lion's share of IS attack claims, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria and Egypt's Sinai peninsula also feature regularly. In a recent message, the IS leadership mocked US President Donald Trump's claim in December to have defeated the group, and insisted that it was far from over. Nevertheless, IS's caliphate model has been over since late 2017, when it lost its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. After that, the group struggled to project the image of a functioning and flourishing state - which had formed the basis of its claim to have revived the caliphates of early Islam. How data on IS activity was gathered The data is based exclusively on what the group itself has claimed through its official ""Nashir News Agency"" media outlets on the messaging app Telegram. The dates reflect when IS said the attacks took place, rather than when the claim was published. The data includes every claim of attack, no matter how small or inconsequential. Most attacks that IS claimed solely through its weekly newspaper al-Naba without issuing a separate statement were not reflected in the data. It is worth noting that IS, like any jihadist group, has a tendency to exaggerate the scale of its attacks and their impact. IS has officially declared that it has a presence in the following countries and regions: Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, ""Khorasan"" (the Afghanistan-Pakistan region), ""the Caucasus"", ""East Asia"" (mostly active in the Philippines), Somalia, and ""West Africa"" (mostly active in Nigeria). Some of these branches, such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, have barely claimed any activity, and others like ""the Caucasus"" rarely claim attacks. The group recently signalled through its propaganda an intention to step up its activity in Tunisia, a country where it has so far failed to make inroads following the 2015 attacks on a museum and beach resort that it claimed. IS also announced for the first time a presence in Burkina Faso. The announcements about Tunisia and Burkina Faso suggest that at least in terms of propaganda, IS is keen to indicate that its trademark slogan ""Remaining and Expanding"" still applies. Unsurprisingly, IS's biggest battleground continues to be in Iraq and Syria, where it clearly has its best resources. Out of a total of 3,670 attacks IS claimed worldwide in 2018, 1,767 were in Iraq (48%) and 1,124 were in Syria (31%). But last year also saw a notable increase in claimed activity by other IS branches. It was as if the group wanted to compensate for its losses in Iraq and Syria and to remind people that it also operated outside the Middle East. In 2018, IS claimed 316 attacks in Afghanistan, 181 in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, 73 in Somalia, 44 in Nigeria, 41 in Yemen and 27 in the Philippines. The number of attack claims by IS West Africa Province in Nigeria has notably risen in recent months. The army has been the primary target, possibly because the group is attempting to seize weaponry and in turn boost its capability. IS has claimed 44 attacks in Nigeria in the first three months of 2019, matching the total number of attacks it claimed in a whole year in 2018. In a propaganda video released in January, IS West Africa Province called on Muslims to migrate to the region and join its branch, signalling that it was ready to receive foreign recruits. On 22 March, IS West Africa Province announced for the first time that it had a presence in Burkina Faso - a country where its rival al-Qaeda has already carried out several attacks. There has also been an uptick in the number of attack claims in the Philippines. IS operates in the country through local affiliates, most of which have been fighting to establish an independent Islamic state in the south for decades. But their attacks, mostly against the army, are still sporadic. And despite repeated calls to its supporters, IS did not claim any major attacks in the West during 2018. The previous year, it claimed four attacks in the UK, including the Manchester Arena bombing; the Barcelona attacks in Spain; and the Las Vegas shootings in the US. However, some of those claims appeared to have been opportunistic, as the group failed to provide evidence. In 2018, IS claimed seven, mostly low-profile attacks in the West that appeared to have been inspired by the group. They comprised four knife or gun attacks in France, and one attack each in Belgium, Canada and Australia.

"By Arash AhmadiBBC Monitoring For example, the lampooning of the clerical classes is generally not acceptable, but cartoons of former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, himself a man of the cloth, go unpunished. Current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is not immune either - cartoons ridicule his looks and prominent nose. His falling out with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei may have something to do this. So it came as a surprise when a cartoonist was recently sentenced to 25 lashes for publishing a caricature of a right-wing MP from Iran's Central Province. Mahmoud Shokrayeh's cartoon of Ahmad Lotfi Ashtiani appeared in the Nam-e Amir journal, published in the central city of Arak. It showed the MP wearing a football kit in the middle of a pitch with one arm on his waist, holding an award certificate in one hand and with his foot on a football. A number of Iranian politicians have recently been criticised for interfering in sports. 'Cruel' punishment Other Iranian cartoonists were quick to come to Shokrayeh's defence. Mana Neyestani condemned the sentence on his colleague as ""cruel and uncivilised"". He went on to call on others to publish more cartoons of the MP in solidarity with Shokrayeh. Other reactions followed. Prominent journalist and blogger Masih Alinejad published an interview with Esmail Kowsari, a member of the parliament's National Security Committee. She quoted the MP as saying: ""I doubt such a sentence would be issued for just a caricature. An accusation has its own punishment."" In another post, she wrote: ""Mr MP, a caricature does not mean insult and rudeness."" Alinejad also praised Mana for his suggestion of more cartoons lampooning the MP. This was followed by the sudden appearance of a number of cartoons lampooning Mr Ashtiani. Cartoonist Jamal Rahmati posted a simple cartoon of the MP, with a caption saying: ""Mr MP, if drawing your cartoon leads to 25 lashes, please come and lash me too."" Meanwhile, Vahid Nikgoo's cartoon showed Mr Ashtiani looking into a mirror with a speech bubble saying: ""I'll take you to court and sentence you to lashes so that you won't draw me like this any more!"" And comments by Iranians on the Balatarin community website were indicative of the mood. ""If I had the skill, I would draw cartoons of this MP for a whole week and upload them onto the net,"" wrote Majidkhan. ""A plea to all those who can, roll your sleeves up and get drawing!"" ""This poor MP made it worse for himself. If he had kept quiet, no-one would have seen the cartoon. He himself has made it go international!"" said another.

"By Reality Check teamBBC News So what has his government already achieved since it came into office in 2014? BBC Reality Check has taken a look at how the BJP government has matched up to its promises over the past five years. A manufacturing superpower? The Modi government has looked to the manufacturing sector to drive economic growth and create jobs. Under the Make in India project, it pledged to raise the share of manufacturing to 25% of GDP - the overall measure of goods and services - by 2025. As the data shows, the contribution of the manufacturing sector has remained just above 15% in recent years, and experts doubt the target will be met. However, the overall rate of economic growth (GDP) has remained strong, at around 6-7% per year, and the government has also highlighted more recent data showing signs of improving industrial growth. A promise to create jobs Mr Modi came to power in 2014 with a promise to create jobs for millions of Indians. The government has delayed the publication of the latest official data on jobs, but a draft version of the report was leaked earlier this year indicating a significant rise in unemployment during the current government's tenure. This has provoked a heated debate over the true situation in the jobs market. You can see our video on the issue here: Keeping India secure At the end of February this year, security became a major issue after an attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, in which 40 soldiers were killed. The government presented itself as the true guardian of the country's security, after launching retaliatory strikes in Pakistan. But the opposition Congress hit back, saying the security situation in Kashmir was now worse under the BJP government than under its own rule before 2014. The data shows that until the end of last year, the level of militant activity under the two governments had been broadly similar. But it is also the case that infiltration attempts into Indian-administered Kashmir have been rising since 2016. Are women now safer in India? The BJP government says it brought in tough laws to combat violence against women. The data shows a rise in the reporting of rape to the authorities, particularly after the notorious Delhi gang rape of 2012. But the conviction rate for cases that go to the courts has not really improved in the last few years. What's the situation in India's villages? The BJP government under Mr Modi made a series of pledges on improving the lives of Indians in rural areas. Three years ago, a commitment was made to double farmers' incomes by 2022. But there are few signs that the government is on track to meet its target. We also looked into promises by the government to alleviate the burden of farmers' debts, which have led to severe hardship within their communities. The evidence that Reality Check found showed that schemes implemented both by the BJP and previous Congress administrations have not been effectively implemented, and can create more problems in their wake. Have plans to clean up India worked? The BJP government also came up with a series of pledges under its Clean India campaign. These included the provision of toilet facilities to address a widespread lack of clean sanitation, and cleaner cooking fuel in the form of subsidised gas cylinders to reduce the amount of kerosene and wood being used in household kitchens. Many households have switched to the cleaner fuel, so this was a considerable success. But the longer-term success of the project has been tempered by the tapering off of subsidies on gas cylinder refills, and many households have reverted to using dirtier fuels. As for toilets, the prime minister has said that 90% of Indians now have access to a toilet - up from 40% before he came into office in 2014. While its true that many more household toilets have been constructed across the country, there is also evidence that not all are working properly, and that - for a variety of reasons - they do not always get used. Cleaning up the Ganges One of the biggest Clean India projects was focused on the River Ganges, which is holy to millions of Hindus. The Ganges has been blighted for years by pollution and overuse. Reality Check discovered that although a lot more money has been made available, only a small proportion has so far been spent.

"Alexandra Porras Inga, 19, and Gabriel Campos Zapata, 18, reportedly died on a night shift while cleaning the kitchen. The New York Times reports they were killed by a loose cable on Sunday. Police said Ms Porras Inga suffered an electric shock from a drinks machine, and Mr Campos Zapata was electrocuted when he tried to help her. Emergency services found both teenagers dead at the McDonald's branch in the Pueblo Libre area of Lima. Peru's public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation. In a statement on Monday, McDonald's operating company in Peru, Arcos Dorados, said it shared ""the sorrow and extreme pain of the affected families"", and would co-operate with authorities to establish what happened. Protesters gathered in Lima the next day to demand improvements to workplace safety. On social media, many young people shared stories of their perilous working conditions, casting light on a nationwide problem. McDonald's could be fined 189,000 soles (£43,000; $56,288) if Peru's workplace safety agency, Sunafil, finds the branch was responsible for the deaths. The Guardian quoted Silvia Cáceres, Peru's labour minister, as saying: ""If the rights of these young people have been violated, we will proceed with the sanctions - although the money is not important because a life has no price.""","Every McDonald's in Peru has been closed for two days of mourning, after two young employees were electrocuted at a branch in the capital, Lima."
"What is rebasing? The United Nations defines rebasing as the ""process of replacing present price structure [base year] to compile volume measures of GDP with a new or more recent base year"". Basically, it's a need to update a country's national statistics. Economies are dynamic things; they grow, they shrink, they add new sectors and technologies and people's behaviours change. One of the uses to which GDP data is put is to track how the economy grows over time. So, as GDP numbers are only relevant when compared to other GDP numbers, the year that serves as the base for their comparison needs to change as well to reflect the changes in the economy. There are basically two ways to measure gross domestic product (GDP), the sum of a country's goods and services. Firstly, nominal GDP. This is the sum value of all produced goods and services at current prices. This measure does have its uses. But real GDP is more widely used and is slightly different. It's the sum value of all produced goods and services at constant prices and is useful for showing how the economy changes in size and - with some further manipulation - how average living standards change over time. The constant prices are the ones from the base year - whichever that is. How to boost GDP stats by 60% Why is it necessary? Rebasing is necessary simply because economies change over time. Different goods are produced and new technology is introduced, so rebasing means that the statistics give the most up-to-date picture of an economy as possible. Most countries do it at least every three years or so. But Nigeria's old GDP base year is 1990. Back then, the country had one telecoms operator with perhaps 300,000 phone lines. Now it has a whole mobile phone industry with tens of millions of subscribers. So without rebasing the statistics from the mobile phone sector, it would remain somewhat under-represented. Likewise, 24 years ago there was only one airline. Now there are a whole plethora, the information of which needs to be captured better in the national figures. Some analysts say that switching the base year to 2010 will boost the country's GDP by as much as 65% - on paper. Is Nigeria's economy about to emerge? Why hasn't Nigeria done this for 24 years? A good question. Often in the recent past, in some of the world's developing economies it has been seen as a non-urgent exercise and frankly there haven't been the resources to do it. That might have been true when the economies of the world were less connected to each other through trade, but now rebasing should be a semi-regular occurrence in most national statistic departments. Also, Nigeria has a new Statistician General, Yemi Kale, who seems to be very keen on beefing up the National Bureau of Statistics. Will it change anything? To the man in the street, no. It will make no difference at all. But it'll be of some interest to economists. Certain ratios will change, for example the debt to GDP ratio will fall. And on a GDP basis, Nigeria will become the largest economy in Africa, knocking South Africa into second place. Nigeria's rebased GDP is thought to be around $432bn (£260bn) compared with South Africa's GDP of $370.3bn at the end of 2013. But some economists would point out that Nigeria's economic output is underperforming because at 170 million people, its population is three times larger than South Africa's. And on a per-capita basis, South Africa's GDP numbers are three times larger than Nigeria's. So, while Nigeria can claim the crown of Africa's largest economy, there are certain caveats. Is Nigeria serious about tackling corruption? Will Nigeria wait another 24 years before doing this again? It is hoped not. It is hoped that this will now become a more regular thing. And not just for Nigeria - Kenya and Zambia are looking to rebase as well. Also, donors are keen for more African countries to do this regularly because it enables them to make better decisions when it comes to aid. But generally speaking, it's a desirable thing for every economy to do, as regularly as is feasible. For example, the United States has a system whereby GDP is constantly rebased, which gives the most up-to-date picture possible. Given the resources most national statistics department have this is just not possible, but at least every four years would be the target.

"The first to board was a group of Syrian refugees, who have been living rough on Kos since they arrived. It is hoped the ship will help the island to cope with a recent influx of migrants, many of whom have come in small boats from neighbouring Turkey. The vessel could provide temporary shelter for up to 2,500 people. The first migrants were allowed to board the Eleftherios Venizelos car ferry early on Sunday morning, after a delay of more than a day in preparing the ship. 'Coming here for peace': Migrants' stories on Kos The Syrians will be processed as refugees as they are fleeing the country's civil war. Correspondents say the Greek government is calling the ferry a reception facility, but critics view it as a detention centre. At the scene: Chris Buckler, BBC News, Bodrum, Turkey At night the lights of Kos can be seen from the shores near Bodrum in Turkey. They make the island appear tantalisingly close for those wanting to head to Europe. Early every morning groups head out into the darkness from beaches here - often in dinghies designed for tourists. There are families among them. Parents carefully fit life jackets on their children in the hope that they can give them a better future in Europe. But it is obvious that for some - both young and old - setting off into the ocean is terrifying. This morning we saw real moments of panic when people fell in the water because the boat was overloaded. It is immediately clear that many have little experience of being in a dinghy, never mind controlling one. Coastguard ships from both Europe and Turkey patrol this stretch of sea and they are picking up people who have got into trouble daily. This water remains a dangerous divide even if it is proving to be an ineffective border. It will be the place where migrants can apply for the documents they need to travel to other parts of Europe. Meanwhile, migrants continued to make the short crossing to Kos from the Turkish town of Bodrum. The Associated Press reported scuffles on Saturday night as people tried to board a small dinghy, while others were forced to bail water out of a small overcrowded boat which seemed to be sinking. Until now, the several thousand migrants who have made the journey to Kos have been sleeping in tents, abandoned buildings or in the open. Clashes broke out this week as police tried to contain people being held inside a football stadium. And on Saturday, there were scuffles as different groups vied for a place at the front of the queue onto the ferry. Thousands of migrants have arrived this year on Kos, an island with a population of 33,000. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) says at least 124,000 people reached Greece's shores by sea in the first seven months of 2015 - more than seven times as many as during the same period in 2014. Nearly all the new arrivals in Greece are refugees fleeing the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, it says. UNHCR European Director, Vincent Cochetel, has said facilities on the Greek islands are ""totally inadequate"".",Dozens of migrants on the Greek island of Kos have begun registering on a passenger ship which will be their temporary shelter as they seek asylum.
"An employee of a photography studio in Kerala state was held on Wednesday for allegedly morphing photos of female clients into pornographic images. Two of the owners of the studio were arrested on Tuesday. Police told the BBC's Ashraf Padanna that they took action after women complained that the images were being used to blackmail them. The images were being shared on social media, the women allege. The employee was a photo and video editor at a digital studio which specialises in wedding and other family photos near the town of Kozhikode. Groups of women had been protesting outside the studio since Monday, demanding the arrest of the employee, who had been sought by police. Police told the BBC the studio had been closed while they ""verify the complaints"". The men, who have yet to be charged, are to appear in court on Thursday, police say. They said they found about 40,000 photos of women on a hard disk in the studio. But it's unclear how many of these images were later doctored. Police are also yet to confirm if any of the images have been published online or released publicly.

"Last week, the island's governor said it would pay most, but not all, of the nearly $1bn (£681.6m) it owed, using extraordinary financial measures. Governor Alejandro Padilla has called for the island to be granted bankruptcy rights like those on the mainland. The US Congress is set to debate the issue in the coming weeks. Overall, the island has a total debt load of about $70bn, which Governor Padilla has said the island cannot pay. The biggest payment on Monday was made towards the general obligation (GO) debt, which came to a total of $328.7m. More than half of that payment was made by raiding funds for other government agencies in a special move being dubbed a ""clawback"", which had the aim of making sure the constitutionally-guaranteed GO debt would be paid. In the end, the manoeuvre meant that the island defaulted on about $37m worth of bonds tied to infrastructure and development institutions on the island. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Mr Padilla said that the island was bracing for lawsuits, and warned that ""every dollar used to pay lawyers will be a dollar...not available to pay creditors"". In recent months, the governor has repeatedly warned of a humanitarian crisis that could unfold and has called on the US Congress to extend bankruptcy protections to the island. US states and territories cannot declare bankruptcy under federal law, though cities and public utility companies on the mainland can. Puerto Rico's public utilities are heavily debt-burdened, but are not allowed the bankruptcy rights that their mainland counterparts are afforded. Republicans oppose extending the right to the island. The White House, while supportive of a bankruptcy option, has ruled out a bailout. ""What we are asking is for Congress to give us the tools to address this crisis,"" Governor Padilla said on Monday. ""We do not want a bailout, we just want the tools to solve his crisis"". Congress is expected the take up the the issue in the coming months, after Democratic efforts to aid the island were killed during budget debates in December. As the debt crisis has unfolded, the economy has floundered, with pundits often calling it the ""Greece of the Caribbean"". Unemployment on the island stands at 12.5% - around twice that of the US - and around 45% of people living in poverty. The island faces a bill of around $400m due in February and a much larger $1.9bn bill in July. ""This is not political rhetoric, this is mathematic,"" Mr Padilla said. ""It's very simple, we don't have the money to pay"".

"Red postal vans are a familiar sight in India. They make thousands of journeys every day, criss-crossing the country's wide network of post offices in 600,000 villages. The postal service does much more than deliver letters and packages. It is also a bank, a pension fund and a primary savings instrument for millions of Indians. Now it will also be transporting medical equipment and drugs to where they are needed most, at a time when transport has come to a standstill. When India went into total lockdown on 24 March in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, all businesses - apart from essential services - were ordered to shut and people were told to stay home. Given that the announcement was made barely four hours ahead of the lockdown going into effect, many industries were left in the lurch - including hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and labs at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. ""We were facing a lot of difficulties. We usually rely on courier services to send out products to customers, but none of them were responding, probably because they didn't have curfew passes or delivery people,"" Ashok Kumar Madan, the executive director of the Indian Drug Manufacturer's Association (IDMA), told the BBC. Many of these products, he added, were essential medicines such as for heart conditions or cancer. Then, he got a call from Alok Ojha, the senior superintendent of the postal service in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. The postal service had already partnered with the IDMA in the western state of Gujarat to deliver medicines and equipment as a priority. Mr Ojha was offering to do the same on a much wider scale. ""We were definitely looking for a solution, and the postal service has unhindered access the country,"" Mr Madan said. That is because India Post is among only a few industries deemed ""essential services"" and allowed to operate normally during the lockdown. ""We thought we could help with this as we have a supply chain that is intact. Many people I spoke to said this would help as it helps keep drugs in the market and prevents hoarding,"" Mr Ojha told the BBC. As word spread, many people began calling and asking for help. Dr Ujjala Ghoshal, a microbiologist at the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in the northern city of Lucknow, told the BBC she got in touch with Mr Ojha when a batch of Covid-19 testing kits she urgently needed was stuck in the capital Delhi, 550km (340 miles) away. ""The Institute of Medical Research told us that we would have to send someone to Delhi to collect the kits because the courier company they usually used was not working, but there was no way we could do it because of the lockdown,"" she said. The postal service, she said, made an exception and actually went to the institute to pick up the kits, instead of having them dropped off at a post office. She received them a day after she made the request. Many other institutions and companies have made similar requests. Mr Ojha says ever since the lockdown began, the postal service has been used to deliver everything from batches of lifesaving drugs to Covid-19 tests, to N95 masks and ventilators, moving medicine and equipment between major cities and states - mostly via the red postal vans. For longer or very urgent journeys - such as a consignment of defibrillators that had to be transported from the state of Tamil Nadu in the south to Uttar Pradesh in the north - cargo planes are used. Sometimes, the consignments must be handled with special care - one drug manufacturer who asked for help said his medicines needed cold chain maintenance, which means they need to be frozen while transported. And so far, every request made to the department has been fulfilled. ""We are the best-connected service in India. We are everywhere. And in this case, we knew we could help,"" Mr Ojha says. And with the lockdown set to be extended, he anticipates that the service will play a larger role in the weeks ahead.",India has the largest postal service in the world - and now it is stepping in to help deliver lifesaving medicines during a countrywide lockdown aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic.

"It is one of three bilateral treaties suspended on Wednesday. The US State Department said the security law had ""crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong"". Last month President Donald Trump also ended Hong Kong's preferential trade and diplomatic status with the US. ""The Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy of the people of Hong Kong,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. The move was expected as the US imposed a raft of punitive measures in the wake of the new law. The Hong Kong government later responded saying it ""strongly objects to and deplores"" the action by the US ""which is widely seen as a move to create troubles in China-US relationship, using Hong Kong as a pawn"". What are the latest measures? They cover ""the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships"", State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus in a statement. The suspension of the reciprocal tax exemptions is likely to take a significant hit on Hong Kong companies - many of these companies had relied on such exemptions for relief. Other nations, such as the UK, Germany and Australia have also suspended extradition treaties in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top officials from Hong Kong and mainland China. Also on Wednesday, Mr Trump praised Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was detained last week under the law. In words bound to anger China, he called 71-year-old Mr Lai - a prominent pro-democracy voice and a supporter of protests that erupted last year in Hong Kong - ""a brave man"". What does the security law mean for Hong Kong? The US sees the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong was guaranteed under the handover agreement. Its special status was agreed between China and Hong Kong's former colonial power, the UK, before sovereignty was returned to Beijing in 1997. The law - which outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since then. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. But China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest.","The US has halted its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, the latest move to pressure Beijing after it imposed a controversial national security law on the former British territory."
"The Lot-et-Garonne region is home to the largest organic farming area in France, and at this time of year the fields are blooming. But as in other regions, the local economy is withering in the face of the punishing eurozone crisis. Patrick Jouy, an industrial strawberry farmer, has seen few of the benefits Mr Hollande promised a year ago. Many of his pickers are Poles; others are Spaniards and the Portuguese, exiles from Europe's struggling economies. Youth unemployment is 17% in the Lot, higher than the national average. But French people are reluctant to take seasonal work, and Mr Jouy says he cannot risk giving out more expensive permanent contracts, particularly when France is in recession. ""It's been far more difficult under Mr Hollande,"" he says. ""Our consumers have less money in their pockets, they are not buying strawberries, and we the employers are paying more and more in social charges. And now even overtime is taxed."" The speciality of the region is plums. And the added value comes from prunes. At Coufidou, a farming co-operative in Saint-Livrade-sur-Lot, they produce exquisite sugared and chocolate-coated prunes. They sell to Fortnum and Mason and the French luxury market. But government figures show the sharpest decline in French spending power since 1984. And like most others, the farmers have been forced to adapt. ""Of course with the crisis, like everyone else, we have had to cut prices and search for new markets,"" says sales manager Semira Baffou. ""And yes we too have to think about our labour costs. It's difficult. Prunes are not like milk or potatoes, in lean times people can go without the luxuries."" In neighbouring Villeneuve-sur-Lot, politics and the economy collide. The constituency belonged to Mr Hollande's former budget minister, Jerome Cahuzac, who resigned last month in disgrace after it was revealed he had stashed a fortune in a Swiss bank. There is a by-election next month, an acid test for the beleaguered Socialist government. The economic figures will compound the misery. ""Yes we worry about the recession,"" said Juliette Cazabat a fashion designer who was shopping in the local organic market. ""We have to support our local producers and encourage them to grow."" New currency In recession people are turning against the euro, globalisation and the import of cheap foreign products. In Villeneuve they have created their own currency. It is called the Abeille. One Abeille equals one euro. But it can only be spent on local produce and services. It is 20 euros to be a member, but it is a non-profit initiative and any money raised is ploughed back into helping local businesses. ""We have 150 families who are using it,"" said Nicolas Queyreau, vice president of the Abeille group. ""And an increasing number of traders. You can pay for your haircut, you can eat in restaurants, and of course you can do your weekly shop. It creates a connection, a relationship between the consumer and their local producers."" The Socialist candidate, Bernard Barrel, who will run in the forthcoming election, is all about supporting local employers. But on a visit to the town of Fumel and Metaltemple, a truck components factory, where shifts has been halved in recent months, he concedes it is not the best time to run for the governing party. ""But we do believe in the programme Mr Hollande has set out. He has implemented 40 of the 60 new initiative he set out,"" he says. ""This is only the first year. The effects are yet to be felt - but they will be."" They have time in the Lot, it is a slower pace of life, but all the problems France is accumulating are flowing into the region. Suddenly recession threatens their cherished quality of life. Restoring it is the government's challenge, and not just for the people of the Lot-et-Garonne.","A year after French President Francois Hollande was elected, promising growth and jobs, the economy has slipped back into recession. As the BBC's Christian Fraser reports, economic problems are affecting rural workers as much as those in the city."
"Buzz Aldrin, fellow member of the Apollo 11 mission and the second man on the Moon I was fortunate enough to be one of those crew members and to fly with an outstanding test pilot Neil Armstrong and accompany him in the Lunar Module Eagle, so it's very sad indeed that we're not able to be together as a crew on the 50th anniversary which I have been looking forward to that in 2019. And I think the entire space, aerospace world will be very saddened to hear this news today - we're missing a great spokesman and leader in the space programme. Michael Collins, the Apollo 11's command module pilot He was the best and I will miss him terribly. US President Barack Obama Neil was among the greatest of American heroes - not just of his time, but of all time. When he and his fellow crew members lifted off aboard Apollo 11 in 1969, they carried with them the aspirations of an entire nation. They set out to show the world that the American spirit can see beyond what seems unimaginable - that with enough drive and ingenuity, anything is possible. And when Neil stepped foot on the surface of the Moon for the first time, he delivered a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten. Today, Neil's spirit of discovery lives on in all the men and women who have devoted their lives to exploring the unknown - including those who are ensuring that we reach higher and go further in space. That legacy will endure - sparked by a man who taught us the enormous power of one small step. Nasa chief Charles Bolden As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own. Besides being one of America's greatest explorers, Neil carried himself with a grace and humility that was an example to us all. As we enter this next era of space exploration, we do so standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong. We mourn the passing of a friend, fellow astronaut and true American hero. Mitt Romney, US Republican presidential contender Neil Armstrong today takes his place in the hall of heroes. With courage unmeasured and unbounded love for his country, he walked where man had never walked before. The Moon will miss its first son of Earth. I met and spoke with Neil Armstrong just a few weeks ago - his passion for space, science and discovery, and his devotion to America will inspire me through my lifetime. Bill Nelson, US senator and former astronaut Neil Armstrong understood that we should reach beyond the stars. His ""one giant leap for mankind"" was taken by a giant of a man. US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta I was deeply saddened to learn today of the passing of Neil Armstrong, one of America's greatest heroes and Naval aviators. We are bidding farewell to one of our own. As a decorated Korean War veteran, as an astronaut for Nasa, and as the first man to walk on the Moon, Neil inspired generations of Americans to believe that as a nation we are capable of achieving greatness that only comes with determination, perseverance, and hard work. As a true pioneer, his one small step showed all mankind the great feats we can accomplish when we set ourselves to the task. While Neil is no longer with us, his spirit and his legacy of American achievement and national pride will live forever. John Glenn, former US astronaut and senator He was willing to dare greatly for his country and he was proud to do that and yet remained the same humble person he'd always been. He was a good friend and he'll be missed.",Politicians and scientists react to the news that US astronaut Neil Armstrong - the first man to set foot on the Moon - has died at the age of 82.
"Kim Yo-jong, the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il, will be replacing her aunt as a member of the Workers Party's Politburo. Ms Kim, 30, was referred to as a senior party official three years ago. The Kim family has ruled North Korea since the country was established following the Second World War in 1948. Ms Kim, who has frequently appeared alongside her brother in public and is thought to have been responsible for his public image, was already influential as vice-director of the propaganda and agitation department. She is blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Her promotion was announced by Mr Kim at a party meeting on Saturday as part of a reshuffle involving dozens of other top officials. When Ms Kim was given a key post at the country's rare ruling party congress last year, it was widely expected that she would take up an important role in the country's core leadership. Among other announcements made on Saturday was the decision to promote Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho - who last month referred to US President Donald Trump as ""President Evil"" at a UN meeting - to a full vote-carrying member of the Politburo. Mr Ri has recently accused Mr Trump of declaring war on North Korea and said that if the president continues with his ""dangerous"" rhetoric the US will become an ""inevitable"" target for missile strikes. The promotions come as a defiant Mr Kim once again made it clear that North Korea's nuclear weapons programme would continue despite sanctions and threats. His comments were made hours before Mr Trump tweeted that ""only one thing will work"" in dealing with Pyongyang following years of dialogue that the US president said had failed to deliver results.",North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has given his sister more power by promoting her to the nation's top decision-making body.
"Her collection included a pair of pearl and diamond earrings that sold for $2.39m (£1.55m), Sotheby's said. The auction house said the collection went for twice as much as the original estimate. Lollobrigida, who rose to stardom in the 1950s and 1960s, said part of the profits would go to stem cell research. More than 20 pieces - many created by Italian jeweller Bulgari - went under the hammer on Tuesday. ""So often women are lucky enough to be given jewellery, but when you have an actress, a famous lady, who has chosen the jewellery herself it makes it that much more interesting,"" said David Bennett of Sotheby's Geneva. The 85-year-old said some of the money would go towards an international hospital for stem-cell treatment. The Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale, which included jewellery from other sellers, also featured a yellow diamond reportedly once owned by a Shah of Persia that sold for just under $3m (£1.97m). Lollobrigida, known in her native country as La Lolla, appeared in films including The World's Most Beautiful Woman (1955) and Come September (1961) but now works as a sculptor.",Jewellery belonging to the veteran Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida has fetched almost $5m (£3.3m) at an auction in Geneva.
"I arrived in Ayodhya on the foggy evening of 4 December 1992. I was on an assignment with The Pioneer newspaper to take pictures of kar sevaks (Hindu volunteers) and Hindu radical leaders who were expected to gather at the Babri mosque site. Thousands of workers belonging to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an organisation dedicated to promoting Hindu nationalism, had already gathered. The RSS is the ideological fountainhead for Hindu groups, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which now rules the country. They planned to start the construction of a temple on the site that they believed was the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. They had given a commitment not to touch the mosque and to restrict construction to a religious ceremony symbolising the laying of the first bricks. A BJP MP I was in touch with told me there was going to be a rehearsal for the demolition of the Babri mosque on the morning of 5 December. ""I have orders from top bosses to ensure that no media is granted access to this exercise. But you are a friend and I am giving you this information,"" he told me. Disguised as a volunteer - wearing a saffron scarf, headband and a special entry badge on my jacket - I was escorted to the meeting ground the size of a football field a few yards from the mosque. Thousands of workers wearing saffron headbands and scarves had gathered there. The area was cordoned off by badge-wearing volunteers. ""This is the only way you can take photographs of the rehearsal. Stay close to me and shout slogans like the volunteers, blend in. This way you will be safe,"" the functionary told me. A burly man suddenly stood before me gesturing me to put away my camera. I pointed to my badge and loudly shouted slogans like everyone else. He nodded and directed me to a large group of men standing at a distance. I whipped out my camera and started taking pictures of the incredible scene unfolding before me. Men with crowbars, pickaxes, shovels and iron rods were trying to topple a huge mound of earth. Everything was done with precision. These were not mere volunteers but professionals who knew how to bring down a building. The Liberhan Commission (the government-appointed panel which tabled its report on the destruction of the Babri mosque in 2009) makes the following observation: ""It was averred before the Commission that a rehearsal was carried out for demolition of the disputed structure. Some photographs too were placed on record before the Commission. It will however not be safe to hazard finding about training in the absence of the conclusive evidence, though there is some circumstantial evidence and some statements do point finger to the conclusion that the Karsevaks were trained in demolition."" My photographs capture a man, the only one in the crowd of volunteers with his face covered by a handkerchief, barking orders at the men tugging away at the mound with ropes and iron wire meshes. He appeared to be some sort of a leader of one of the right-wing parties and, therefore, didn't want to disclose his identity. The mound was successfully toppled to loud cheers and lusty slogans from the volunteers. I hid my camera inside my jacket and exited the place, chanted along with the crowd, thrilled that I was the only journalist to have witnessed this rehearsal and photographed it for posterity. The next day, I along with other journalists took position on the fourth floor of a building overlooking the mosque and a raised platform where important leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and BJP were overseeing a rally of at least 150,000 volunteers. Even police guarding the site were shouting slogans. Just after noon, the crowd turned violent and charged at the policemen and volunteers guarding the mosque. Some climbed to the fourth floor and attacked journalists and broke cameras of photographers in an effort to wipe out any photographic evidence of the demolition as it was under way a few metres away. In the matter of a few hours the mosque was razed to the ground. I ran as fast as my legs could carry me towards the hotel. Riots had already started. I looked around for policemen or anyone who could help, but people were shutting shops, closing doors and windows of their homes. The day they brought down the mosque, I felt ashamed of being a Hindu. I have deposed as a witness before the Liberhan Commission and still continue to be called by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as a witness in the special court which is hearing the case on the demolition. It has been 25 years, but none of the people responsible for the demolition have been punished. Praveen Jain, Associate Photo Editor with Indian Express, spoke to Anasuya Basu.","Hindu mobs tore down the 16th Century Babri mosque in India's holy city of Ayodhya on 6 December 1992. The riots that followed killed nearly 2,000 people. A day before the incident, photographer Praveen Jain joined a group of Hindu volunteers to witness what they claimed was a ""dress rehearsal"" for the demolition. Here, he shares his pictures and tells his story of that day."
"The military and riot police have been deployed in an effort to quell the violence, which started on Tuesday. Experts say the fights were prompted by a battle for control of the jails after a gang leader was killed in December. The number of dead is higher than the total of inmates killed in 2019 and 2020 combined. Early on Wednesday local time, prison authorities said the situation was now ""under control"". They updated the number of dead and said the violence had also engulfed a fourth jail. The deadliest incident happened in Turi prison, in the city of Cuenca, where 34 were killed. There were also fatalities in two prisons in the city of Guayaquil and in a jail in Latacunga. All of those killed were inmates, officials said. The first reports of fights came in at about 09:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Moncayo said tension had been running high since the killing in December of Jorge Luis Zambrano, the leader of the Choneros gang. Zambrano, alias Itch, was shot dead in a cafeteria just months after being released from jail. During his time in prison, he and his gang ran a lucrative smuggling, drug dealing and extortion ring which mainly - but not exclusively - operates inside Ecuador's jails. Tuesday's deadly fights are thought to have been over who should replace Zambrano and were said to have been planned and highly organised, according to Interior Minister Patricio Pazmiño. Over the past two years, the government has twice declared emergency measures in Ecuador's jails - in May 2019, when 10 inmates were killed within weeks, and in August 2020, when a key witness in a corruption case was murdered inside his cell.

"By Anna HolliganBBC News, Amsterdam Holleeder's most infamous crime has recently been turned into a movie soon to be released across Europe and there is a new Hollywood version in the making. So what makes him such an irresistible figure in crime fiction? Thriller novelist Ton Theunis believes the answer lies in his character rather than his crimes. ""He has this incredible aura about him. Like he is completely in control. Even inside it was like he was untouchable,"" Theunis says. ""He has a very strong presence and you can really feel that. He is exciting and dangerous and for some reason we will always be attracted to those things."" Life of crime In 1958 Willem Holleeder was born in Amsterdam. His father worked at the Heineken factory. Friends say he had a difficult childhood. One source who wishes to remain anonymous remembers growing up in the same area as Holleeder. In his early teenage years, Holleeder's gang was already establishing itself as a powerful force in the playground. ""They used to roar up on the latest mopeds, mostly stolen from German tourists, when we were all playing football,"" he says. ""Holleeder and his friends would invade the pitch and try to play and if any of us tried to object we'd get whacked with a motorbike helmet."" An early indication, perhaps, of the path Holleeder was destined to pursue. Theunis met Holleeder when the former was working as a prison guard and the latter was locked up for extortion. ""He has been linked to just about every murder in Amsterdam in the last 30 years. But the police can never pin anything on him because of a lack of evidence,"" Theunis says. Despite efforts on both sides to kill or capture Willem Holleeder, the ""Dutch godfather"" remains alive and now he is free. Perfect kidnapping? The Heineken Kidnapping is a fictional adaptation of a true story. On 9 November 1983 Holleeder and his gang executed what they believed would be the perfect kidnapping. Armed with Uzis and shotguns they headed for Heineken HQ. Grabbing beer magnate Freddy Heineken and his chauffeur Ab Doderer off the street at gunpoint, they bustled them into the back of a van. The hostages were driven to an abandoned lockup near the harbour where a secret room at the back had been specially converted to function as a makeshift cell. When the hostages were securely shackled the kidnappers demanded a ransom of 16m euros ($21m; £13.3m). Eventually Heineken's family handed over the cash. But instead of releasing the hostages, Holleeder's gang fled leaving Freddy and Ab locked up. Luckily the police had a lead through a Chinese takeaway the gang had been using. After three weeks in captivity they were finally rescued. Blocking the blockbuster They were accused of a plethora of crimes including murders, blackmails and shoot-outs but it was this single event that gave Holleeder's gang a reputation more notorious than any other in Dutch history. The Heineken kidnapping had all the makings of a blockbuster. But the uncooperative star of the show, Willem Holleeder, launched a lawsuit from behind bars to try to stop the film from being released. ""Mr Holleeder didn't like how the character was depicted in the film,"" says Jens van den Brink, the lawyer representing the film company IDTV. ""For example, in the film there is a mock execution like Russian roulette where they put the gun to the head of Heineken and pull the trigger. ""Mr Holleeder said: 'That never happened and you are making people think we are worse than we really are.' I argued that first, there is artistic licence and second, if you have already kidnapped two men at gunpoint and chained them to a dirty mattress in an abandoned warehouse - well, it is hard to harm the reputation of someone accused of doing so many terrible things."" The release Almost three decades have passed since the Heineken kidnapping. These days the real William Holleeder isn't the young, virile, untouchable gangster feared by so many back in the 80s. Most of his former colleagues have been murdered, locked up or taken off to less dangerous destinations. Holleeder has repeatedly refused earlier parole - maybe feeling life is safer on the inside than it is on the outside. According to those that know Willem he is not looking forward to freedom. Does crime writer Ton Theunis think this fear is justified? ""Imagine you are accused of being involved in so many murders. Maybe you have not been found guilty but still you know people want you dead,"" Theunis says. ""I remember working at the prison and one of the prisoners was being allowed to go home for Christmas,"" he recalls. ""I was watching him leave, he got on his bike in a shiny new track suit smiling and waving at us. Then as soon as he got to the car park - bang! - and he was gone. ""Criminals are killed all the time. Of course Holleeder is right to be afraid."" Willem Holleeder reportedly left prison in a car with blacked out windows before being transferred to another secret vehicle. It is a whole new underworld out there. He no longer commands control over the criminal network in the way he once did and his health is not what it used to be. There is speculation Holleeder will try to escape the Netherlands on the next available flight. He has so far turned down all of our interview requests and his lawyer says he wants to avoid any further attention.","The man known as the godfather of Dutch crime has been released from prison in the Netherlands. Willem Holleeder served six years of a nine-year sentence for extortion. He has been a hugely powerful, notorious and influential figure on the Dutch underworld for decades."
"The Church had expressed grave concern for Peter Shao Zhumin, who was removed from his diocese last May. His friends said they feared that he was being pressured by the authorities to pledge his allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party instead of the Church. His disappearance led to a public row between China and the Vatican. Relations have been strained by disputes over who can appoint bishops in the country. However recent reports have said that the Vatican and Beijing are drawing closer to reaching an historic agreement governing the selection of bishops for 10 million Chinese Roman Catholics. There are currently about 100 Catholic bishops in China, with some approved by Beijing, some approved by the Vatican and, informally, many now approved by both. There are thought to be about 12 million practising Catholics in China, divided between officially-sanctioned and underground churches.","A Chinese Catholic bishop who was detained for seven months has been freed, the Vatican says."
"What's been happening at the four-day event? Let's back up first. There's an obvious question... What is the Republican National Convention? OK, good question. Party conventions take place once every four years - they are the ceremonial crowning of the party's presidential candidate as they prepare for the final phase of campaigning. Last time around, we saw the Trump family take centre stage to a backdrop of fireworks and a sea of red, white and blue balloons. It's also where party officials wrap up other less glamorous business, like unveiling the political platform and adopting rules. This time - for the first time - no new platform is being adopted. The party will continue to support Mr Trump's 2016 manifesto. As the sitting president, Mr Trump is the de facto nominee but the convention has formally nominated him with a roll call, nonetheless. On Thursday, the president will formally accept the nomination with a big speech. How is the Republican National Convention being held this year? The conventions of years past have been glitzy affairs, bringing together thousands of delegates, party leaders, activists and celebrities for receptions, speeches and general hyping up of the presidential candidate. But the pandemic has upended all that. Unlike its Democratic counterpart, the Republican Convention is hosting some in-person events at venues in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington DC, along with speeches delivered remotely. Each day will follow themes of America as the land of promise, opportunity, heroes and - in a nod to Trump's slogan - greatness. People are being told they need to wear masks and social distance. Those attending events are given a self-swab Covid-19 test before travelling and entering their hotels. OK, so where will Trump be? Trump has been involved in some regard each day of the convention, either in person or in recorded videos. He will accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. This hasn't been entirely well received - with critics arguing using federal property for a campaign speech is unethical. Who else will speak on the final day? In addition to President Trump, the following will be speaking on Thursday: Who spoke on Wednesday night? Vice-President Pence addressed the convention remotely from Baltimore's Fort McHenry, where the city was defended against the British in the War of 1812, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. The former Indiana governor argued that Joe Biden would set the country on to ""a path of socialism and decline"". As pitchman for Mr Trump's re-election, he said voters need ""a president who believes in America"". On a night with the theme ""Land of Heroes"", his wife Karen Pence also addressed the convention, paying tribute to ""military spouses"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House next week, said of Mr Trump: ""He has stood by me, and he will stand up for you."" The 53-year-old announced this week that she was resigning from her post as senior adviser to Mr Trump at the end of August to focus on her children, giving them ""less drama, more mama"". Two black speakers on Wednesday pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message: Clarence Henderson, a civil rights activist from the 1960s, and Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and Fox News commentator who is running for office in Utah. Several military veterans also addressed the convention as well as four of the party's rising female stars: Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, New York Representative Elise Stefanik, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and presidential daughter-in-law Lara Trump. Who has already spoken? US First Lady Melania Trump made a heartfelt plea for racial unity when she delivered a live speech from the White House on Tuesday. The day also saw two of the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump, making fierce attacks on the Democrats while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Israel, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, and critics called his participation unethical. Monday, the convention's opening day, was dominated by a speech by President Trump himself in which he warned Republicans their opponents might ""steal"" November's election. His claim that postal voting could lead to voter fraud has been dismissed by experts and election officials as a conspiracy theory. His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, described Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as ""basically the Loch Ness monster of the swamp"". What time is the Republican National Convention? The convention is expected to last 2.5 hours each night, Monday to Thursday, from 20:30 EST (00:30 GMT) to 23:00 EST (03:00 GMT). You can follow the latest news, including a live page on Thursday, at bbc.com/news. BBC World News and the BBC News Channel (available globally and in the UK, respectively) will broadcast Mr Trump's speech live and bring you reaction and analysis afterwards. And you can also watch on the Republican National Convention website. What to watch out for Few incumbent presidents of the modern era have faced a challenge as great as the one before Donald Trump in the final months of their re-election campaign. He has consistently trailed Joe Biden in the polls by a modest but significant margin for months. The Republican Convention is one of his last, best opportunities to turn the tide. The president's speech will be a good guide for how the Republicans hope to conduct their campaign over the final months. Will he focus on tearing down Joe Biden or on accomplishments from early in his presidency? Or will he try to convince the public that the worst days of the pandemic are over? The Democrats during their convention turned to voices from ""ordinary"" Americans - immigrants, workers and minorities - who said they had been harmed by the president's policies. The Republicans have countered with ones who will recount how they've been helped - or who are worried about what the Democrats would do in power. Have they made a compelling case? The rest of the week has been be filled with Republican officeholders of various levels. Some, including Vice-President Mike Pence, will be vying for position to lead the partyonce Trump leaves office - either next year or in 2024. Four years ago, Trump defied conventional practices and wisdom to win the presidency. He's remade the Republican Party in his image, with an emphasis on conservative populism and sometimes brash rhetoric. That new party, his party, has been on full display this week. What happens next? Now we watch as campaigning heats up before the general election on 3 November. Be sure to set a reminder for the debates too, where we'll see Biden and Trump battle to win over voters. The first presidential debate is scheduled for 29 September with two more in October.","The Republican National Convention is nearing its conclusion, with Donald Trump set to close the event with a speech making the case for his re-election."
"The Pope urged Christians to ""embrace hospitality"" and reject the ""logic of selfishness"". The Paraguay visit was the culmination of the Pope's eight-day tour of some of South America's poorest countries. During his previous stops in Bolivia and Ecuador, he spoke out against social injustices in the region. He also apologised for the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the brutal colonisation of most of Latin America by the Spanish. 'Welcome the stranger' ""Welcome the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, the prisoner, the leper and the disabled,"" Pope Francis spoke at the Mass in Asuncion. ""Welcome those who don't think like us, those who don't have faith or have lost their faith."" Earlier the Pope visited the Banado Norte shantytown in Asuncion, home to some 100,000 people. He urged residents to stand up for each other. ""No matter how many Masses on Sundays, if you don't have a heart in solidarity, if you don't know what is happening in our town, your faith is very weak, or it's sick or it's dead."" Pope Francis, who was born in Argentina, is the first leader of the Roman Catholic Church to come from Latin America. Thousands of people travelled from neighbouring Argentina for the Pope's last Mass in the tour, including President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.",Hundreds of thousands of people have attended the final Mass celebrated by Pope Francis during his visit to Paraguay.
"By Arturo WallaceBBC Mundo, Medellin It is an eclectic offering, which includes the likes of Hello Kitty, Jesus Christ and Che Guevara. But according to Mr Giraldo, stickers boasting the image of Colombia's infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar are by far the most popular. ""The best seller is Pablito,"" Mr Giraldo says of the crime boss, who was shot dead in Medellin while trying to escape from police 20 years ago. 1980s terror Mr Giraldo is by no means the only one cashing in on the image of the man many consider the greatest outlaw of the 20th Century. At the height of his power, Pablo Escobar was said to be the seventh richest man in the world, with his Medellin drugs cartel thought to be behind up to 80% of all the cocaine shipped to the United States. His cartel not only trafficked drugs, it terrorised Colombia in the 1980s and early 1990s, bribing, kidnapping or killing all those who stood in its way. Such was his ruthlessness he is widely held responsible for some 4,000 deaths. Others say the real number is closer to 5,000. And yet, here in Medellin, some people still affectionately refer to Escobar as Pablito, and in the commercial district of Junin T-shirts and wristwatches emblazoned with his face as well as books and DVDs telling his story are on display. TV hit Last year, Colombian TV network Caracol released a 63-episode series called Escobar: The Boss of Evil. The series has already been sold to 66 countries, including North Korea. Pirated copies of the series are immensely popular in Medellin's markets even as Caracol airs the series for a second time. David Bustamante is one of those selling the DVDs. He says he has no qualms about making money out of the drug lord's story. ""I don't mind selling it. Maybe because his was a war that didn't affect me,"" says Mr Bustamante, who was just a baby when Escobar was killed. Caracol has not released figures of the profits it has made on the series, but it seems to be on its way to becoming one of the biggest commercial successes in the history of Colombian television. Mixed memories But not everybody in Colombia is happy about the commercial success of all things Escobar. ""In a way it is an example of the triumph of culture embodied by Pablo Escobar, in which profit, making three bucks, is more important than anything else,"" says Rodrigo Lara Restrepo, whose father, Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, was shot dead on Escobar's orders in 1984. Federica Arellano agrees with Mr Lara. He lost his father in the 1989 bombing of a commercial plane ordered by Escobar in an attempt to kill presidential candidate Cesar Gaviria. Mr Gaviria was not on board the plane - having cancelled his plans for security reasons - but all 107 passengers and crew, and three people on the ground, died in the attack. 'Damaging message' ""Personally, coming back home and seeing his [Escobar's] face on the TV screen is an insult, a slap in the face,"" Mr Arellano says. ""It is also sending quite a damaging message. It is saying: 'Go and become a criminal, because that way you can make money fast and lift your family out of poverty,'"" Mr Arellano, who chairs a foundation for Escobar's victims, argues. ""Thankfully there are still some sensible people who rejected the idea of having the Pablo Escobar trademark registered,"" he adds, referring to a recent move by the drug baron's family to cash in on his continued popularity. Escobar's son, Santiago Marroquin, recently launched a clothing range with images of his father. Mr Marroquin, who lives in Argentina, says he does not sell the garments in Colombia out of respect for his father's victims. But, at least in Medellin, it is not difficult to find T-shirts bearing Escobar's face, or Colombians who still see the founder of the Medellin cartel as a sort of hero willing to buy them. ""People really like them because it's like wearing a [picture] of a Saint you have faith in,"" explains Jenny Zapata, who sells Escobar-themed T-shirts at Pasaje Junin in Medellin. ""The thing is, some people see Pablo Escobar as a bad guy and others see him as a hero, as someone who was able to do the things that no-one else was able to do here in Medellin. And a good example is the barrio [neighbourhood] he built,"" she adds. Neighbourhood pride The neighbourhood, nicknamed by its inhabitants Pablo Escobar, sits atop one of the many hills that surround Medellin's city centre. It is one of the many ""gifts"" Escobar gave to the city's poorest inhabitants in an attempt to secure their loyalty. It is this sort of generosity which explains why, two decades after his death, he remains a cult figure among some. A big flag with the drug baron's face clearly marks the neighbourhood's entrance. ""We respect the pain of his victims, but we ask people to understand our joy and gratitude, what it means to move out from a garbage dump to a decent house,"" Ubernez Zavala, a local community leader, tells the BBC. According to Mr Zavala, Barrio Pablo Escobar has become a popular stop for tourists, with several companies in town offering Escobar-themed tours. He says residents do not mind the commercialisation of Escobar's image, but he acknowledges that there is unlikely to be any agreement between those who see Escobar as a monster and those who still worship him as a saint. ""The only consensus is that Pablo Escobar is part of our history,"" he concludes.",Jose Giraldo earns his living on the streets of Medellin selling humorous road signs and stickers with iconic images.
"By Anthony ZurcherBBC News, Washington As Mario Cuomo, the two-term governor of New York who died earlier this month, once said: ""You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose."" If so, Mr Obama's 20 January, 2009, inaugural address was the final speech of the historic 2008 presidential campaign, emphasising hope and opportunity over specific policy goals. ""On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord,"" Mr Obama said from the steps of the US Capitol. ""On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics."" In an address to a joint session of Congress Mr Obama made a month later - a State of the Union in all but name - the president made a more workman-like effort, setting a tone and style he would largely follow in all of his congressional addresses. He talked of the need to rebuild the economy, then in the midst of a severe downturn, and touted the $787bn [£518bn] stimulus spending law the Democratic-controlled Congress had just passed. In those early months of his presidency, Mr Obama was at the height of his power. With approval ratings in the mid-60s and sizable majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, he and his party firmly controlled the levers of power. During his February speech the president laid out an ambitious agenda. He endorsed financial regulation reform, an overhaul of the nation's health insurance system and a cap-and-trade plan for regulating greenhouse gasses. He also pledged to end the US war in Iraq and close the Guantanamo Bay detention centre. Mr Obama again addressed Congress in September of 2009 to help push healthcare reform through Congress, but by his first formal State of the Union Address in 2010, storm clouds were on the horizon. The public was wary of the increasing budget deficits and an economy that was still reeling. While the recession had officially ended in June 2009, the unemployment rate wouldn't come down from its peak of 9.9% until April 2010. The president pledged a government spending freeze and cuts to unaffordable or unnecessary programmes. Although later that year the Democrats narrowly passed healthcare and financial sector reform, it would be the last legislative achievement for Mr Obama's party. Cap-and-trade was all but dead, and Republicans blocked action on Guantanamo. The grass-roots conservative Tea Party movement was growing in strength, and it would sweep Republicans to control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 mid-term elections The president's next two State of the Union addresses, and a September 2011 address to Congress on jobs legislation, would be more reactive in nature. His proposals would remain largely unpassed. After winning re-election the president in his 2013 State of the Union address called for an increase in the minimum wage, more funding for college education and climate change legislation. The speech was dominated by talk of firearm regulation, however, on the heels of the attack that left 20 children and six adults dead in a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school. With Republicans still in control in the House, however, none of these policy items would become law. By his 2014 State of the Union address, the president seemed resigned to the fact that none of his legislative priorities would be endorsed by Congress. His approval ratings had sunk to new lows, thanks in part to a botched rollout of the healthcare.gov website the previous autumn. The president's speech focused primarily on things he could accomplish without congressional approval, such as limited immigration reform and greenhouse gas regulation. The ""unity of purpose"" the president spoke of in 2009 seemed a distant memory. Now, exactly six years after his first inaugural address, the president - his dark hair now generously peppered with grey - speaks to the US people, and Congress, again. For the first time in his presidency, thanks to his party's rout in the 2014 mid-term elections, he faces a legislature wholly controlled by his political opponents. Perhaps counter-intuitively this development may more clearly define the president's remaining power. Where over the past four years he could count on the Democratic Senate to snarl Republican plans hatched in the Republican House of Representatives, the chance that legislation he finds unappealing reaches his desk is now considerably greater. He may finally find it necessary to wield one of the most powerful weapons in the presidential arsenal, the veto. The president's standing with the American people may be on the upturn, as well. His approval ratings have rebounded from the lows that helped seal his party's fate last year. The employment rate continues to decline, reaching 5.6% in December. The president is now fully on the defence in Congress, but he appears willing to counter-punch, with revamped proposals to make higher education more affordable and reform the tax structure. Whether it makes any difference to how the Republicans go about their agenda over the next year remains to be seen, however. The reality is that this likely is the last real chance the president has to use a high-profile speech to put his imprint on US politics and policy. He has one more State of the Union address to give, in January 2016, but by then the race to succeed him in office will be in full swing. Both parties will be in the midst of choosing new standard-bearers, and legislative action will grind to a halt. By then all eyes will be focused on the identity of the next person who will speak to the nation from the steps of the Capitol.","Exactly six years after his inauguration, President Barack Obama offers Congress and the nation another State of the Union address. A look at these annual speeches reveals the rising and falling fortunes of the president's tumultuous time in office."
"It is the first film of Bin Laden to emerge since al-Qaeda released a video address by him in 2007. The Pentagon released the video with the audio removed. Here is what the clips show: FIRST VIDEO A relatively long clip of Bin Laden making a statement to camera. He is wearing a white headcovering, a white shirt and a golden robe, and his delivery is in a style similar to that of previous video addresses by the al-Qaeda leader. He is reading from notes on the table in front of him. He has his hands laid flat on the table, though he occasionally raises his right index finger for emphasis. He is wearing a ring on the little finger of his right hand. Pentagon officials said it was a message to the United States. There is no confirmation it was shot at the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was found, but that is where he is said to have been living for the last few years. SECOND VIDEO Shows Osama Bin Laden watching footage of himself on television. The television is on a small table with what looks like a satellite box next to it. The al-Qaeda leader is seen sitting in front of the table, apparently cross-legged on a carpeted floor, using a remote control. He has a blanket over his shoulders and is wearing a black woolen hat. He strokes his beard, which looks grey - not black as in the other video clips. Two other monitors, both switched off, can be seen in the room. There is what looks like a black sheet to the left of the TV, possibly covering a window. At the start of the clip a list of channels come up, and it appears that Al-Jazeera is selected. The images playing on the TV seem to be old footage of the al-Qaeda leader, including shots of him walking in the mountains. There is also an image of the twin towers in New York in flames on 11 September 2001, with a still photo of Bin Laden superimposed on top of it and Arabic script. THIRD VIDEO The first of three videos in which Bin Laden appears to be rehearsing for a video message. He is wearing the same clothes as in the first video, but with a bare wooden panel or door as a backdrop. A white sleeveless vest is visible under his white shirt. FOURTH VIDEO Here too, Bin Laden seems to be rehearsing. He starts to talk, then glances to his right uncertainly before continuing to speak to the camera. He is again wearing a white shirt and hat, though not the gold robe. The backdrop is plain and dark brown. FIFTH VIDEO Another short clip of Bin Laden dressed in white shirt, hat and golden robe, speaking to camera. This time the backdrop is what looks like a crumpled blue sheet. As in the previous videos, he occasionally looks down to read from notes.","The Pentagon has released five home video clips of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, seized at the secret compound in northern Pakistan where he was shot dead by US special forces this week."
"Natalya Veselnitskaya is accused of fabricating evidence while working to defend a Russian company in 2013. Prevezon Holdings was accused of participating in a tax fraud scheme that laundered $230m (£180m). Officials have confirmed Ms Veselnitskaya is now wanted by the US Attorney's Office in New York. An indictment, unsealed on Tuesday, accuses the lawyer of submitting an ""intentionally misleading declaration"" to the US government in defence of the company, after it requested information from Russia in relation to the case. ""Veselnitskaya's declaration presented supposed investigative findings by the Russian government - findings purportedly exonerating Veselnitskaya's clients - under the false pretence that these findings had been independently drafted by the Russian government,"" the indictment says. It alleges the 43-year-old ""secretly"" worked with a Russian prosecutor to draft the response. She has previously denied working on behalf of the Russian government. Prevezon Holdings, the company at the centre of the case, was ordered to pay almost $6m ($5m) to the US government in a civil settlement. Who is Ms Veselnitskaya? The lawyer first made headlines in the US when it emerged she had met with senior Trump campaign aides, including Mr Trump's son Donald Trump Jnr, in 2016 to purportedly exchange information about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. The meeting is considered a key part of the special counsel's investigation into alleged Russian meddling during the 2016 US election. Tuesday's charge, which is unrelated to that probe, carries a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison. US media report that the lawyer is thought to currently be in Russia. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Ms Veselnitskaya said she would ""defend her professional honour"" but declined to comment further. It is not clear whether the lawyer will return to the US to face the charge.",A Russian lawyer who famously attended a meeting with top Trump campaign aides in 2016 has been charged in a separate obstruction of justice case.
"For many years, South Africa's biggest and most disciplined opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has had a relatively easy ride. Its power and reach grew consistently in successive elections as it began to take control of important municipalities, led since 2015 by a charismatic young black man, Mmusi Maimane, the party started to position itself as a force that would soon sweep to power nationally. The DA was helped in this project by the increasingly spectacular failings of the governing African National Congress (ANC) - particularly in the last decade - under what many South Africans concluded was the overtly corrupt, tired, and incompetent leadership of former President Jacob Zuma. The DA wisely positioned itself as the anti-corruption party, and earned an impressive reputation for good governance in towns and communities across the country. Mr Maimane gave barnstorming speeches haranguing President Zuma as a ""broken man"". ANC wakes up The DA had little incentive to resolve deep policy rifts within its own ranks. It believed that all it had to do was say ""we're better than the ANC"", and the voters would surely follow, ushering South Africa's young democracy towards electoral maturity in which a governing party appeared vulnerable. But then, in 2017, the ANC woke up. At the end of that year, it dumped the discredited Mr Zuma and brought in a new leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, who appeared genuine in his commitment to tackle corruption and fix a broken economy. At this year's elections, many black South Africans chose to give the ANC - the party that once liberated them from racist white-minority rule - one more chance, while the DA's white support base also began to fracture. For the first time, the DA's share of the national vote dropped, slipping down to 21%. Some soul-searching, and staff changes in the party, were inevitable. But in recent weeks the DA has gone much further than that. The election setback has triggered a vicious factional war inside the party - a war that now threatens to push it back to the margins of South Africa's political landscape. Some commentators are wondering if the party can even survive. A great deal is now at stake both for the DA, and for multi-party democracy in South Africa. Which way forward? The DA's factionalism is complicated and often over-simplified, but it centres on South Africa's apartheid past, and how best to tackle the enduring racial inequality here. The question is whether to focus on non-racialism, on growing an economy that will benefit all communities, which is the preference of the party's older, more conservative core. Or whether the party should be more committed to transformation, backing pro-black empowerment schemes and generally looking to woo poorer black voters, which is the view of erstwhile leader Mr Maimane. Crunch-time came last weekend, when the DA's strident former leader, a white woman, Helen Zille, abruptly returned to high office in the party. She is a dynamic but increasingly divisive and - one might argue - tone-deaf figure, whose 2017 tweets on colonialism infuriated Mr Maimane and offended many black South Africans. When news was leaked that an internal panel set up to investigate the recent election setbacks had recommended that Mr Maimane step down, his resignation became almost inevitable. And so, in the course of a few days, the DA has lost its leader, its chairman and the mayor of Johannesburg, who resigned on Monday. Can it bounce back? Of course, it can. Indeed some will argue that all this is just a brief, necessary, and constructive purge for the party. But behind all the nuance and the complexity, lies a simple challenge. To rebuild and progress, the DA needs to hold on to its white supporters, some of whom are defecting to more radical parties, while convincing black South Africans that it is not returning to its historical roots as a minority party predominantly representing the interests of whites, who make up just 9% of the population. You may also be interested in: The idea that the party's crisis can be reduced to a simple black-white issue might seem absurd. After all, South Africa has changed enormously since apartheid, and the modern DA is full of young black officials and politicians who have helped make strong inroads in black communities. But 25 years after the advent of democracy, racial injustice remains a raw and dominant theme here. The ANC and its radical off-shoot, the Economic Freedom Fighters have, increasingly, sought to exploit and inflame the issue, blaming the country's economic problems on ""white monopoly capital"", and often attempting to polarise politics along racial grounds. In his resignation speech on Wednesday, Mr Maimane described the DA as being the wrong ""vehicle"" for his vision of building a united South Africa, prompting speculation that he and other departing figures may seek to form a new party. After so many years of ANC rule, there is a huge appetite here for a competent, centrist party that can win black support, keep the government on its toes and perhaps eventually push the ANC out of power. But in 25 years, plenty of new parties and ANC splinter groups have fizzled out, or retreated to the extremes. Only the DA has maintained the support, and the organisational clout, to win control of a province, and to look like a potential government in waiting. Now all that is under threat.","The resignation of the leader of South Africa's main opposition party has robbed it of a man who was viewed as a potential president and raised questions of whether it can tackle the country's ingrained racial injustice, as Andrew Harding reports from Johannesburg."

"In the latest development, he is to face trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power for allegedly seeking to influence a judge who was looking into suspected illegal financing of his election campaign. In separate investigations he has also been accused of receiving campaign funding from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and is to face trial for allegedly overspending campaign limits in 2012. He denies any wrongdoing. What is the latest development? The case for which Mr Sarkozy now faces trial centres around wiretapped phone calls in which he allegedly discussed the idea of offering a prestigious role in Monaco to a high-ranking judge in exchange for information on a financing investigation. Prosecutors say Mr Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, tried to obtain information from the judge, Gilbert Azibert, about the investigation centred on alleged illicit payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt to help Mr Sarkozy win the 2007 election. Mr Sarkozy was later cleared of taking any such funds. The case surfaced in 2014 and Mr Sarkozy became the first former French head of state to be held in police custody before being formally placed under investigation. He is expected to stand trial along with Mr Herzog and Mr Azibert. They all deny any wrongdoing What is the Gaddafi case about? In March 2018, Mr Sarkozy was questioned in police custody over long-standing claims that he received illicit funding from Col Gaddafi for his 2007 election campaign. French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine has previously told the French news website Mediapart that in 2006-07 he handed over three suitcases stuffed with cash to Mr Sarkozy and Claude Guéant, who was his chief of staff. Mr Takieddine alleged that the cash came from Gaddafi and totalled €5m (£4.4m; $6.2m). Mr Guéant, who was managing Mr Sarkozy's presidential campaign at the time, told the franceinfo website that he had ""never seen a penny of Libyan financing"". Mr Sarkozy also denies any wrongdoing and says some former Gaddafi regime officials want revenge for his decision to send French warplanes during the 2011 Libyan uprising. What else is Mr Sarkozy accused of? The other case for which Mr Sarkozy has been told to stand trial is known as the Bygmalion affair and centres on claims that Mr Sarkozy's party, then known as the UMP, worked with a friendly PR company to hide the true cost of his 2012 presidential election campaign. France sets a €22.5m (£19m; $24m) limit on campaign spending, and it is alleged the firm Bygmalion provided a series of false invoices for €18m to Mr Sarkozy's party rather than the campaign. Investigators say that the false accounting enabled the party to spend well over the limit. Mr Sarkozy himself is accused of knowingly exceeding the spending limit by setting up campaign rallies even though he had been warned of the risk. He is appealing against the order to stand trial. Employees at Bygmalion have admitted knowledge of the ruse and Mr Sarkozy is among 14 people caught up in the affair to face trial. The other suspects include ex-UMP colleague Eric Cesari, campaign heads Guillaume Lambert and Jerome Lavrilleux as well as Bygmalion staff. As well as illegal campaign financing, the accusations involve forgery, abuse of trust, fraud, and complicity in illegal financing. Mr Sarkozy lost the 2012 race and failed in his bid to run again in the 2017 presidential election. What has Mr Sarkozy said? Mr Sarkozy wrote about the Bygmalion scandal in a book published in 2015. ""It will no doubt be hard to believe, but I swear it is the strict truth: I knew nothing about this company until the scandal broke,"" he said. Regarding claims of influence peddling, he has firmly denied doing anything ""contrary to the values of the republic or the rule of law"". He has spoken of ""political interference"", suggesting that the judges who had ordered that he be questioned in custody had an ""intention to humiliate"".",Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy's political ambitions have been overshadowed by investigations since he left the Elysee Palace in 2012.

"Prosecutors said they were given 20-year jail terms after the journalist's family decided to pardon them. However, his fiancée said the ruling made ""a complete mockery of justice"". Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed inside the kingdom's consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul by a team of Saudi agents. The Saudi government said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" and the following year Saudi prosecutors put 11 unnamed individuals on trial. The trial was dismissed at the time as ""the antithesis of justice"" by UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard, who concluded that Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Ms Callamard said there was credible evidence that high-level officials, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were individually liable. The prince denied involvement, although two former aides are being tried in absentia in Turkey on the charge of instigating the premeditated murder of Khashoggi. Eighteen other Saudis are accused by Turkey of carrying out the killing. How did Jamal Khashoggi die? The 59-year-old journalist, who went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on 2 October 2018 to obtain papers he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. After listening to purported audio recordings of conversations inside the consulate made by Turkish intelligence, Ms Callamard concluded that Khashoggi was ""brutally slain"" that day. The Saudi public prosecution concluded that the murder was not pre-meditated. It said the killing was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". The journalist was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, according to the prosecution. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate. The remains were never found. Turkish prosecutors concluded that Khashoggi was suffocated almost as soon as he entered the consulate, and that his body was destroyed. In December 2019, the Riyadh Criminal Court sentenced five people to death for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for ""covering up this crime and violating the law"". Three people were found not guilty, including Saudi Arabia's former deputy intelligence chief, Ahmad Asiri. Saud al-Qahtani, a former senior adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed, was investigated by the Saudi public prosecution but not charged. Why were the sentences changed? This May, Khashoggi's son Salah announced that he and his brothers were ""pardoning those who killed our father, seeking reward from God almighty"", accepting the contention that the murder was not premeditated. That paved the way under Saudi law for a reprieve for the five facing execution. On Monday, the Saudi public prosecution announced that the Riyadh Criminal Court had sentenced five of those convicted in January to 20 years in prison, and that the three others had received sentences of between seven and 10 years. It said the verdicts were final and that the criminal trial was now closed. Ms Cengiz said in a statement: ""The ruling handed down today in Saudi Arabia again makes a complete mockery of justice. ""The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder. Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body? These are the most basic and important questions that remain totally unanswered."" Ms Callamard welcomed the fact that the death sentences had been commuted, but said the verdicts could not be allowed to ""whitewash what happened"". ""The Saudi prosecutor performed one more act today in this parody of justice. But these verdicts carry no legal or moral legitimacy. They came at the end of a process which was neither fair, nor just, or transparent,"" she tweeted. Ms Callamard said Crown Prince Mohammed ""remained well protected against any kind of meaningful scrutiny"" and again called on the US intelligence services to release their reported assessment that he ordered the killing of Khashoggi.","A court in Saudi Arabia has commuted the death sentences handed to five people convicted over the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, state media report."
"""The first time I performed naked in a truly public space ...it was great fun. ""There was a camera person there and if you watch his footage you can see a jerk when the lights come on because he literally fell over in shock. And someone in the audience said 'Aiyo!',"" Mallika Taneja recalls, laughing. But although it is the most talked about aspect of her play, the 33-year-old says nudity is not the point of her piece. Thoda Dhyan Se (Be a little careful) is meant to provoke people into thinking about whether women's clothing really has any correlation with sexual violence. It is also, in a sense, an expression of something she says motivates a lot of her work - the impact of a single body in any given situation. ""What does it take for a group to be dispersed? Just one person dissenting. ""A single body can stand in the middle of a crowd and bring it to a halt,"" she says. ""For example, if a group of people are running one way, all it takes is just one person running the other way to disrupt the flow."" The opening scene - where she stands naked and looks at her audience for a full eight minutes - is an example of that. In every performance she has done in the last four years, she says, those first minutes have been met with a silence that ""fills the room"". In that moment, Ms Taneja adds, as she watches her audience watch her, she is aware that although outnumbered, she is the most powerful body in that space. But she is also the most vulnerable. ""As a woman in particular, I find the entire concept fascinating. What is it about our bodies that terrifies people so much, that it always has to be hidden away and regulated?"" Performing naked on stage is still an unnerving experience for her. She is very strict about not allowing mobile phones and other recording devices inside the hall. Notably, in the four years that she has performed the play, not a single photograph or video of her nudity has surfaced online. As the play goes on, Ms Taneja wears more and more clothes, even putting on a helmet at some point, each time explaining to her audience that as a woman, she needs to ""be a little careful"". ""Be a little careful"" is a phrase which though often used with concern, is still a subtle form of victim shaming in cases of sexual assault. Women are often asked why were they out that late at night? Why were they alone with men? Why were they dressed a certain way? They are constantly told that if something happens to them, then they are also partially responsible, that they should have ""been a little careful"". It is this attitude that Ms Taneja is attempting to challenge, using her own body as a weapon. ""Women identify with the piece easily, but what is important is that many men say it has been an eye-opener for them. Some of them say that after watching the play, they feel horrible about being male. But that is not the point of my piece, it's not to make them feel bad, it's to start conversations."" Her preference for solo work is partly inspired by her own lifestyle. Ms Taneja is unmarried, lives by herself and does not work a regular nine-to-five job but pays her own bills through her theatre work. She concedes that success, and the financial security that has come with it, has given her a lot more power to resist. ""No-one - not my father, no-one in my family - questions my lifestyle or my work,"" she says. This sort of fiercely independent existence is not as rare as it once was, but is still by no means the norm in India. If unmarried, many women would be expected to continue living in their parental homes. But it is exactly this type of rebellion - unseen yet significant - that is seeing so many young Indian women come out of the shadows and assert their rights. And this is what Ms Taneja says she also tries to capture in her work. ""We do have the power to say no. Yes there will be consequences, and it is easier for some of us to do it than others, but finally it is up to us. If we don't say no to the things happening to us, who will?"" If a woman says no even once, she adds, then they will have made their contribution to the cause of equality. And while she acknowledges the importance of larger movements to bring people together, she reiterates that finally, change will only happen when the individual has decided to take a stand. In 2012, India saw that happen. The horrific Delhi gang rape prompted hundreds of thousands of women to come out on to the streets, shouting that they had put up with enough. India's tough new rape laws and a complete change in the way rape was reported and talked about, were direct consequences of that anger. Ms Taneja's play was prompted by her own anger towards a similar case that took place a year later in Mumbai when a photojournalist was gang-raped while on assignment. ""What is the fight for? Our bodies and everything they carry,"" she says. She does get asked some tough questions though. A lot of women who have watched her play ask her if she would have performed the piece if she had not been slim. ""I don't know the answer to that. This is the body I have always had. All I can say to them is 'I hope so'. But having said that, I am aware that I have a type of body that is more 'acceptable' to society,"" she says thoughtfully. She concedes that with every performance it has become easier, and standing in front of strangers is always better than seeing someone she knows in the audience. But there are still off days. ""Sometimes I just don't feel good. Sometimes I have my period. But I still have to go out there, stand up straight and do it,"" she says. ""But it is my body and I refuse to lose control of it."" This story is part of a series about Indian women fighting for equality","Imagine a young woman beginning a performance standing naked on a stage. In conservative Indian society, it is very hard to imagine but for playwright and actor Mallika Taneja, the body is the most powerful tool in the battle for women's equality. She told the BBC's Ayeshea Perera what motivates her."
"They were created by storms lashing the region in recent days. Such phenomena are more characteristic of Russia's Arctic far east. The walls are formed when a storm exerts sideways pressure on thick ice covering a sea, river or lake. The ice is bad news for seals, though, as it can cut them off from the sea. A conservation group - the Baltic Seal Foundation - is urging Russians to alert it to any stranded seals found in the region. Some have been spotted from helicopters. One baby grey seal, just a few days old, was rescued last week and is doing well now, the group reports, with a video on vKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook. The seal, swaddled in blankets, is fed five times a day with a pipette. It became stranded in Gakkovo, a coastal village near Estonia. The most dramatic ice wall pictures so far have come from Zelenogorsk, on the northern shore of the Gulf of Finland, just outside St Petersburg. Alexander Bravo posted images of the wall on the local website Terijoki.spb.ru. He calls it ""the Zelenogorsk Alps"".

"The government says the ban will help protect the environment. But manufacturers of the bags have argued that 80,000 jobs could be lost. A court on Friday rejected a challenge to the ban. Kenyans are estimated to use 24 million bags a month. Several other African countries have outlawed plastic carrier bags, including Rwanda, Mauritania and Eritrea. Kenya's ban is seen as one of the toughest in the world, although officials say that for now, ordinary shoppers will be warned and have their bags confiscated. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Piles of waste plastic bags are a common site across Kenya, as in many African countries. Animals often graze on the rubbish and the United Nations' Environment Programme says huge amounts of polythene bags are pulled out of livestock in Nairobi's abattoirs - as many as 20 bags per cow - raising fears of plastic contamination in beef. Kenya's Environment Minister Judy Wakhungu says the plastic bags take between 20 and 1,000 years to biodegrade. ""Plastic bags now constitute the biggest challenge to solid waste management in Kenya. This has become our environmental nightmare that we must defeat by all means,"" she told the BBC. No arrests for offenders yet - Anne Soy, BBC Africa, Nairobi Kenyans are slowly getting used to carrying their shopping using bags made from materials other than plastic. At a local supermarket, I saw a man stuff a bunch of unwrapped spinach into his backpack. Other customers bought bags made from fabric for 10 Kenyan shillings (10 US cents; 7 British pence). The $38,000 fine with the alternative of a four-year jail term has many people preferring to comply with the ban. The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) says that enforcement officers can, for now, only confiscate plastic bags but not arrest offenders. Reports say traders in the city's main meat market are still using plastic bags. Others say people are using old sacks, newspapers and envelopes. When these are not available, consumers are said to be carrying their goods with their bare hands. Travellers coming into Kenya with duty-free plastic shop bags will be required to leave them at the airport under the new rules, Nema has said. This is the third attempt in the past 10 years to ban plastic bags in Kenya. The government had given a six-month window for adjustment which expired on Sunday night. Manufacturers who use polythene to wrap products are exempted from the ban. In its ruling last week, the High Court dismissed a case filed by two plastic bags importers urging it to drop the ban. The court ruled that environmental concerns were more important than commercial interests. Research in Europe has shown that a paper bag must be used three times to compensate for the larger amount of carbon used in manufacturing and transporting it. Likewise a plastic ""bag for life"" must be used four times, and a cotton bag must be used 131 times.","A ban on plastic carrier bags has come into force in Kenya, which means that anyone found selling, manufacturing or carrying them could face fines of up to $38,000 or prison sentences of up to four years."
"Its new report alleges the interior ministry has developed an ""assembly line"" of abuse to collect information and prepare often fabricated cases. Officers beat suspects and use electrical shocks and stress positions with ""almost total impunity"", it says. The government has denied allegations of widespread and systematic torture. It has blamed abuses on individuals and said they are held accountable. The 63-page report released by Human Rights Watch on Wednesday says Mr Sisi, who led the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 following protests against his rule, is pursuing political stability ""at any cost"". The alleged abuses, it concludes, probably amount to a crime against humanity. In the past four years, more than 1,000 protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces, at least 60,000 people are reported to have been arrested or charged, hundreds have been handed preliminary death sentences, and hundreds more have gone missing in apparent forced disappearances. Most of them have been supporters of Morsi's Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, but liberal and secular opposition activists have also been targeted. HRW researchers interviewed 19 former detainees and the family of a 20th detainee who said they were tortured between 2014 and 2016, as well as Egyptian defence and human rights lawyers. The former detainees alleged that the torture sessions began with security officers using electric shocks on a blindfolded, stripped, and handcuffed suspect while slapping and punching them or beating them with sticks and metal bars. If the suspect failed to give the officers the answers they wanted, the officers increased the power and duration of the electric shocks and almost always shocked the suspect's genitals, they said. Officers would then hold detainees in two types of stress positions for hours at a time and continue to beat, electrocute and interrogate them, they added. A 29-year-old accountant, who was given the pseudonym ""Khaled"", told HRW that he was tortured for almost six days in Alexandria in 2015. Officers forced him to read a prepared confession, which they filmed, stating that he had burned police cars on the orders of the Brotherhood, he said. ""Khaled"" alleged that when he told a prosecutor that he had been tortured, the prosecutor replied that it was none of his business and ordered him to restate the confession or face further abuse. ""You're at their mercy - 'Whatever we say, you're gonna do'. They electrocuted me in my head, testicles, under my armpits. They used to heat water and throw it on you. Every time I lost consciousness, they would throw it on me,"" he said. Another former detainee alleged that police ""repeatedly raped"" him with a stick. HRW said prosecutors had officially investigated at least 40 torture cases since 2013, but that they represented a ""fraction of the hundreds of allegations made"". In only six cases were guilty verdicts won against interior ministry officers, all of which remain on appeal. ""President Sisi has effectively given police and National Security officers a green light to use torture whenever they please,"" said Joe Stork, HRW's deputy Middle East director. ""Impunity for the systematic use of torture has left citizens with no hope for justice."" HRW said President Sisi should direct the justice ministry to appoint an independent special prosecutor empowered to inspect detention sites, investigate and prosecute abuses by security services, and publish a record of action taken.","Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has given a ""green light"" to security forces to routinely torture political detainees, Human Rights Watch says."
"By Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent Far away, in the early hours at the grand Petersberg Palace in Bonn, Afghan delegates at a UN conference finally agreed that Hamid Karzai would be their new interim leader. In Kabul, I heard the news on BBC World TV and immediately reached for our satellite phone. ""Hamid, what's your reaction to being chosen as the new leader?"" I shouted down the crackling line when the former mujahedeen spokesman I had known for years answered his satellite phone at his makeshift military base in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. ""Am I the new leader?"" he replied, a note of anticipation rising in his voice. Still dealing with the last remnants of Taliban resistance, Hamid Karzai had just survived an aerial attack by a stray US bomb that killed three US soldiers and many Afghan fighters. He had not received the call from Bonn and he did not even mention the incident. ""Are you sure?"" he queried. I told him I had heard the news on the BBC. ""That's nice,"" was his first, simple reaction in his signature, folksy style. So began the Karzai years in power. As they near their end, errant Nato attacks and a deeply strained relationship with his most important ally count as his ""biggest disappointments"". ""Do you remember that day nearly 13 years ago?"" I ask him as we stand close to the arch of the Haram Sarai palace in the heart of the heavily fortified palace compound. ""We arrived at 04:00 and there was no electricity or heating,"" he recalls. Hamid Karzai facts When Afghanistan's newly chosen leader made it to an expectant Kabul on 13 December - the day the first winter snowflakes fell - he told me: ""The first priority is total peace and security for the people of Afghanistan."" Speaking inside a cold dark palace that day, surrounded by Afghan fighters and friends, he also spoke of other priorities including ""an economic possibility so that our people earn a decent living... a fight against terrorism to finish it completely... to make Afghanistan a country ruled by law, ruled by regulations, that gets back its institutions"". Wearing the same kind of grey Karakul cap he still dons to this day, he spoke of how ""good would come"" if foreign troops were able to help Afghans, as they built their own security forces. Now, two smartly dressed sentries stand guard outside the Haram Sarai entrance, on the edge of manicured lawns fringed with roses in colourful bloom. Afghanistan today is, undeniably, a different country. But there is still no peace or prosperity for the vast majority of Afghans who had dared to hope that the end of Taliban rule would also finish three decades of punishing war. In 2001, Hamid Karzai seemed to embody the hopes of an entire nation - a mujahid from the war against the Soviets who was not a warlord; a Pashtoon tribal leader who was an ardent nationalist; an English-speaking Afghan at ease in the West who kept the best of his country's traditions. Much to the surprise of those who worried he was not up to this greatest of challenges, he strode confidently on to the world stage with charm, charisma and that distinctive green silk chapan. But re-building a land shattered by poverty and war turned out to be much harder than anyone expected. A leader who lacked the resolve to face up to powerful warlords, and the resources to fight or negotiate with the Taliban on his own, grew ever more frustrated and angry. After his narrow escape in a 2002 assassination attempt in Kandahar, which we witnessed at first hand, he has been forced to spend most of his time in his veritable fortress. But in conversation and speeches, he constantly invokes his meetings with Afghans from more ordinary walks of life, who come to see him or whom he meets on his rare forays beyond the walls. ""Do you feel you failed the Afghan people?"" I ask the leader who was first selected in Bonn, confirmed by a traditional assembly or Loya Jirga, and then elected in two presidential polls. ""Afghanistan is a much better country,"" he responds, without hesitation, as we sit in the elegant marbled hall that became his place of choice for formal interviews. As he prepares to leave office he agreed to sit down with me and my colleagues from the BBC's Persian and Pashto services. ""We still have problems, we are still a poor country, one of the poorest in the world. We have a long journey ahead of us as a nation."" He speaks with visible affection of a country that ""became the home of all Afghans. We practised democracy, we voted, there's education, freedom of speech, of expression, and Afghanistan's flag is flying all over the world"". But then a 56-year-old leader with a trim grey beard and three young children expresses regret. ""There are many happy children, but sadly too many children that became sad, who lost their families."" For a man who promised his people peace, he says ""lack of peace is a regret I will take with me"". ""I wish there was not so much loss of life and the war on terrorism was fought genuinely in the right place."" A few years ago, in an outburst of private pain at a public gathering, he invoked his love for family and nation. ""For God's sake we must stop this violence,"" he implored the Afghan gathering as he wiped his tears to thunderous applause. ""I fear my son Mirwais will have to leave this country. I want him to grow up here."" The Karzai Years World News GMT times as follows: Sat 12 Jul 12:30 Sun 13 Jul 00:30 , 07:30, 19:30 BBC News Channel (BST) Sat 12 Jul 14:30 Sun 13 Jul 05:30, 10:30, 16:30 Mon 14 Jul 01:30 As foreign combat forces prepare to pull out at the end of 2014, Afghans grow increasingly worried about a declining economy, deteriorating security and the threat of a Taliban return. But President Karzai remains stubbornly optimistic about his country and his people. ""The year 2014 turned into a devil for Afghanistan, an evil for Afghanistan, but it proved wrong,"" he said, summing up what has become known among Afghans as ""2014 paranoia"". ""We're moving forward, let me repeat myself, if it is Afghanistan alone, and its people, we will have no problem. If there is a broader international conspiracy for the region, then of course we will fall victim."" Now he sees conspiracies in many places. Over nearly 13 years, over tea served in the palace's delicate china cups, I have heard the president's language about his Western allies evolve from special friends to ""a business-like relationship"" to ""treacherous"". ""Foreign forces have not brought any stability to Afghanistan and they will not,"" he now insists with a deeply felt sense of betrayal. ""Yes, we do need international support where we don't have the means to sustain ourselves, that is welcome, we are grateful."" But when it comes to the ""war on terrorism"" he reiterates his often-repeated view that the ""fight has to be genuine and true and that is not in the homes and villages. It has to go to the sanctuaries and training grounds and to the financial support to terrorists beyond Afghanistan"". It is a point Hamid Karzai has stressed since he came to power. Everything from satellite imagery to telephone intercepts back his view, and the view of many Afghans, that the root of the problem lies in sanctuaries of the Taliban and other armed groups in neighbouring Pakistan. Western leaders, who had warmed immediately to a well-spoken Afghan with an infectious sense of humour, now speak with dismay about what they see as erratic behaviour verging on paranoia. I point out that his Nato allies are astonished and angry when he accuses them of deliberating trying to create instability. ""The consequences are what we see,"" he explains. ""Intention is a different issue, it's hidden from us. ""I see the results. The region is a lot more unstable, there is a lot more violence. I hope that can be reversed and I hope that I'm termed wrong one day by the West, by their good work to bring more stability."" The imbroglio over the 2009 presidential election also still festers like an open wound. Despite credible reports of significant fraud, he holds Washington's perceived desire to see him replaced entirely responsible for a crisis that led to a bitter standoff between him and his main challenger, Abdullah Abdullah. ""How can a nation which talks about promoting democracy do so much to destroy it?"" he remarked in a conversation last year, pointing to comments from former US Defence Secretary Robert Gates who wrote how top US diplomats had tried to manipulate the election outcome ""in a clumsy and failed putsch"". Even though the president's outlook is now clouded by seeing America's hand in every failure, there is always some evidence he can use to support what can often be extraordinary claims. At his desk where he took some of the most difficult telephone calls with his allies including from Washington, I ask him when the conversations started changing from being very friendly to being, at times, barely on speaking terms. He says the turning point was 2007 and the main issue was civilian casualties. ""But I never hung up the phone,"" he insists. In recent years he has repeatedly railed against Nato attacks that mistakenly kill innocent Afghans. His critics point out that he lashes out in that direction more often than he does against casualties from Taliban attacks even though UN figures make it clear the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by violence from insurgent groups. And when it comes to the Taliban, President Karzai firmly rejects any suggestion that their brazen and brutal attacks confirm a rejection of peace talks. ""The Afghan Taliban are in contact with me every day with exchanges of letters, meetings, and a desire for peace,"" he insists, brushing aside their frequent statements that they will not talk to a leader they dismiss as an ""American puppet"". Again he lays the blame for the failure of negotiations squarely at the door of Washington and Islamabad, not the Taliban. And what about his own responsibility when it comes to another issue that troubles Afghans - the rampant corruption? Why did he look the other way and not hold his officials and allies to account? ""Hang on!"" he declares. ""Who brought the contracts? The Afghan government didn't give any contracts, the US did that. ""The layers of sub-contractors, the billions of dollars thrown in, who did that?"" he demands. A recent Pentagon report backs up his claim that far too much money flooded a fragile system unable to absorb and control it. But last year's assessment from Transparency International ranks Afghanistan as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, just above North Korea and Somalia. ""I will take responsibility for the petty corruption in the day-to-day administration and delivery of services,"" the president concedes. ""But the big money is not ours nor did we have control of it."" After nearly 13 long hard years, Hamid Karzai insists he is now ready to go, that it is time for a new leader to do ""what is undone"". In 2001, he seemed to be the right man at the right time. For many Afghans, the challenges of 2014 need a new leader at the helm willing to confront the major problems and issues Hamid Karzai was unable or unwilling to resolve, including what many Afghans regard as a vital bilateral security agreement with the US. We often called Hamid Karzai the ""big tent"" man. He insisted everyone should have a place in the new Afghanistan, even the warlords who, repeated human rights reports said, should be tried for war crimes. He refused to allow the formation of political parties that would have helped Afghanistan move away from faction-based movements into a more mature political culture. He always insisted there was no ""opposition"" in one big Afghan nation. Years ago, a frustrated UN envoy said Hamid Karzai should have been a ""priest"", not a politician. His friends say he was like his father, Abdul Ahad Karzai, from whom he inherited the mantle of the Popalzai tribe when he was murdered. He did not like confronting people, and instead relied on his personal armoury of teasing, cajoling and bestowing rewards. Over the years, Afghans looking for positions or permissions were infuriated by a leader who would make promises to one group in the evening, and a rival group in the morning. Hamid Karzai wanted to be like a father of the nation who could heal his country's wounds and strengthen its institutions to allow it to stand on its own two feet. He understood instinctively how power worked, through tribal and militia networks, right down to village level. An Afghan friend told me of his amazement when the president was able to name district chiefs from across the country. But he never felt he had the power of his office. As commander in chief, he was thwarted in the early years by having fewer men and less money than the powerful warlords. In later years, he was embarrassed and angered by well-resourced foreign armies who went into Afghan villages doling out money and conducting raids. One US commander once told me that when he went to see the president to inform him that they would soon launch an offensive in Kandahar, the president replied that it was the first time he had been informed in advance. The leader who famously never took holidays, save a few days walking in the hills of Scotland, now says he will take the shortest of breaks and then focus on many other projects, including writing. No-one doubts that in his newly-built house, on the edge of the palace, he will continue to play a role. He describes himself as ""more experienced, quite realistic, no more wishes or ideas about others that are not as I thought they were, and hardened"". As night falls, he resumes the routine he has kept almost every day since he entered the palace. He walks home inside ever-multiplying palace walls, flanked by aides and bodyguards who struggle to keep pace with his brisk stride. Two armoured vehicles bring up the rear of his procession. Inside his own gate, he runs into the arms of his first daughter, three-year-old Malala, as his eldest son, eight-year-old Mirwais, cycles enthusiastically with his friends, weaving circles across sprawling lawns. ""Did you miss your Daddy?"" he asks his pretty, doe-eyed daughter as he hugs her close. ""Let's go then."" Post-war Afghanistan $60bn in civilian aid 2002 - 2012 35.8% below poverty line 8.6m children in school 17,605 civilians killed since 2008",It all began on 5 December 2001 - a grey winter's day in Afghanistan.
"Meanwhile, former President Fidel Castro has written that he is ""happy"" to meet the pope, in an article on the government's website. After arriving in the capital, Havana, the pope told a crowd he prayed for a Cuba ""advancing along the ways of renewal and hope"". Cuban officials have insisted that political reform is not on the agenda. Marino Murillo, one of Castro's vice-presidents and the ""economics czar"" in charge of liberalisation, told journalists the government was updating the Cuban economic model to make socialism sustainable. ""There will be no political reform in Cuba,"" he said. The pope's visit marks the 400th anniversary of the discovery of a statue of the Virgin of Charity of El Cobre - also known as the Mambisa Virgin - which was found floating in a bay by fishermen. It was revered by Cuba's independence heroes. Improving relations Pope Benedict XVI knelt for several minutes before the wooden statue, where he said he had prayed for those who ""suffer"" and are ""deprived of freedom"". ""I have entrusted to the Mother of God the future of your country, advancing along the ways of renewal and hope, for the greater good of all Cubans,"" the pope said. Later, Pope Benedict held an hour-long closed-door meeting with the leader of the communist country. No details were released, but brief video feeds showed Raul Castro greeting the pope at the Palace of the Revolution, and later seeing him off. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford says change and openness are emerging as the themes of the Papal visit to the one-party state, where Roman Catholics now account for 10% of the population. Observers say relations between Church and state have warmed in Cuba in recent years. Raul Castro has accepted the Church's mediation on issues such as political prisoners, recognising its position as the most influential organisation outside the communist government. The Pope's visit is seen as an effort to further improve relations and increase the role of the church in Cuban society at a time of rapid change. In a short opinion piece on the government's website, Fidel Castro announced he would be happy to meet Pope Benedict, after speculation of a possible meeting. According to AP, Mr Castro said: ""I will happily greet His Excellency Pope Benedict XVI as I did John Paul II, a man for whom contact with children and the humble generated feelings of affection."" The pope is scheduled to leave on Wednesday afternoon after a Mass in Havana's Revolution Plaza. Our correspondent says that if the pope does meet Fidel Castro, it would be a good further opportunity to discuss the processes of change in Cuba. The pope has said the church is ready to help with those changes. Church officials have said there is no time in his schedule to meet dissidents. Opposition groups say dozens of dissidents were detained ahead of the visit, and others were prevented from attending the service in Santiago.",Pope Benedict has met Cuban President Raul Castro on the second day of his visit to the communist-run island.
"The projections were made by a group of academics and health experts advising the government. They assume tough lockdown restrictions will be eased from June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced. The curbs - which were introduced in March and include a ban on tobacco and alcohol sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus. The country of 57 million people has recorded just 17,200 cases of Covid-19 and 312 deaths linked to the disease so far. Spain, by comparison, has reported about 278,000 cases and almost 28,000 deaths for a population of only 47 million. But the projections by the South African Covid-19 Modelling Consortium - set up to help government planning over the outbreak - says the country could experience a sharp rise in cases and deaths over the coming months. The report was released during a meeting with Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize following criticism of the government's perceived lack of transparency. The predictions are subject to change as more data becomes available, and assume the current restrictions will be relaxed from 1 June. Under an ""optimistic scenario"", by late August the number of active cases could reach almost 100,000, before declining. The cumulative number of deaths by November would be 40,000. Under a ""pessimistic scenario"" the number of active cases could peak around at 120,000 in August, and a total of 45,000 would die by November. The report also suggests there could be 1.2 million Covid-19 cases in total, and intensive care units could be overwhelmed within weeks. South Africa's balancing act By Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg The politics of Covid-19 and scientific rivalry have intensified in South Africa. The opposition Democratic Alliance is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent lockdown regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted. The government itself is not speaking with one voice. This month President Cyril Ramaphosa said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" to allow schools to reopen and more people to return to work from early June. But Health Minister Zweli Mkhize seems reluctant, and has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day. It's a balancing act for the government, which has to take the issues of food security, job losses and the economy into consideration. Some scientists have called on the government to fast-track lockdown restrictions to level 2, claiming the current ones have little or no effect on the spread of coronavirus. In March, President Ramaphosa imposed some of the strictest lockdown measures of any country. Most workers were ordered to stay at home. In addition to the tobacco and alcohol bans, jogging, cycling and dog-walking were also prohibited. On 1 May, the curbs were eased from ""level 5"" to ""level 4"", allowing people to exercise between 06:00 and 09:00. People are still urged to wear face masks in public and observe social distancing rules.","At least 40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africa by the end of the year, scientists have warned."
"The announcement came in tweets from the current council president, Herman Van Rompuy, at an EU summit. Ms Mogherini, a centre-left politician, is Italy's foreign minister. She will replace the UK's Catherine Ashton. Mr Tusk, Poland's centre-right prime minister, has been Polish leader since 2007. He will chair EU summits. The full-time appointments mean that the EU's three top jobs are now filled. Mr Tusk and Ms Mogherini will work closely with the new European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr Tusk, 57, will serve for two-and-a-half years (renewable), starting on 1 December. Ms Mogherini's term, starting on 1 November, is five years. Mr Van Rompuy called Mr Tusk ""one of the veterans of the European Council"", the grouping of EU government leaders. He is the only Polish prime minister to have been re-elected since the collapse of communism in 1989. Mr Van Rompuy praised ""the determined and confident way he has steered Poland through the economic crisis, and managed to maintain steady economic growth"". As a student Mr Tusk was active in the Solidarity anti-communist movement. Mr Van Rompuy said Mr Tusk would face three major challenges: the stagnating European economy, the Ukraine crisis and ""Britain's place in Europe"". He said the EU leaders were convinced that Ms Mogherini, 41, ""will prove a skilful and steadfast negotiator for Europe's place in the world"". He noted Italy's ""long-standing tradition of commitment to the European Union"". 'Huge challenges' Mr Tusk then made a short address in Polish. He said that ""in December I'll be 100% ready"" to speak English.

On arrival at the summit the European Parliament President Martin Schulz, a Socialist, spoke warmly of Ms Mogherini, calling himself a ""fan"". It was a strong indication that she would be a popular choice among MEPs.

Italy's centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi pushed hard for Ms Mogherini to get the job.

"By Ethirajan AnbarasanBBC News, Dhaka Mr Yunus's appearance will focus on his Grameen Bank and work on micro-credit, which has helped millions of people lift themselves out of poverty. The Nobel laureate's voice has already been recorded for the episode, which will air in October. The Simpsons regularly attracts big-name guests such as Elton John, Stephen Hawking and Tony Blair. Yeardley Smith, who voices the character of Lisa Simpson, has already spent a week in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka studying the Grameen Bank. She is a long-time admirer of Mr Yunus and has visited Grameen micro-credit programmes in Haiti and elsewhere. Mr Yunus and his Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the concept of micro-credit - lending small amounts to the poor to help them start up businesses to get out of poverty. He started it in 1976 by lending $27 (£17) to a group of families in a village. Grameen is now a billion-dollar micro-credit venture with more than eight million borrowers in Bangladesh alone.",The Bangladeshi anti-poverty banker Muhammad Yunus is to feature in an episode of hit US TV show The Simpsons.
"There were clashes in Barcelona as police tried to disperse the protesters. Pablo Hasel was taken to prison on Tuesday, after barricading himself in a university to avoid arrest. He faces nine months in prison for glorifying terrorism and slandering the crown and state institutions over tweets and song lyrics. Hasel's case has reignited a debate about free speech in Spain. Demonstrations were reported in cities across the Catalonia region and in the eastern city of Valencia on Tuesday night, hours after Hasel began serving his sentence. In Barcelona, around 2,000 people joined protests and waved placards reading ""Free Pablo"". Some violence was later reported on as police moved in and demonstrators set rubbish bins alight and threw objects. The biggest demonstration involved 5,000 people in the city of Girona while hundreds more gathered in Lérida (Lleida in Catalan), where the rapper was arrested earlier in the day. Another 2,000 people called for Hasel's release in his home town of Segrià, according to Catalan media. Fifteen protesters were arrested and 33 people were hurt including 17 police officers. The court building in Vic near Barcelona came under attack and the police station was damaged. Members of the Catalan police force, known as Mossos, entered the University of Lleida on Tuesday morning after the rapper defied a deadline to hand himself last Friday. His supporters, who had joined Hasel inside the building, sprayed fire extinguishers at police before the singer was led away, shouting ""they will never silence us; death to the fascist state"". More than 200 artists, including film director Pedro Almodóvar and Hollywood star Javier Bardem, have signed a petition against Hasel's jail term, while Amnesty International described his arrest as terrible news for freedom of expression in Spain. Fellow Spanish rapper Valtònyc, who fled to Belgium in 2018 after being convicted of similar offences, told the AFP news agency he felt ""shame"" and ""anger at seeing a colleague treated like this for doing what artists do, which is to provoke"". The Spanish government said last week it planned to reduce the penalty for ""crimes of expression"" - including the glorification of terrorism, hate speech and insults to the crown and religion - in cases that involve artistic or cultural activities. Besides attacks on the monarchy, Pablo Hasel's tweets and lyrics accused police of torturing and killing demonstrators and migrants. Pablo Hasel - whose real name is Pablo Rivadulla Duro - was found guilty of glorifying terrorism in a separate case in 2014, but his prison sentence was suspended in 2019 on condition that he did not reoffend within three years.",Thousands of people have taken to the streets in Spain overnight in support of a jailed rapper.
"The UK Treasury is reviewing Low Value Consignment Relief which is blamed for forcing small UK internet retailers to close. Jersey has a special status where goods under £18 are VAT-free when sent to the UK from outside the EU. It led firms such as HMV, Tesco and Amazon to open big warehouse operations on the Channel Islands. But Senator Alan Maclean, Economic Development Minister, said the industry is not under threat. He said an agreement was reached to stop UK companies coming over to just take advantage of the VAT-free prices, and 17 UK companies were asked to leave Jersey in 2006. He said Jersey welcomes companies that want to move to the island and employ staff and contribute to the economy, but not people who just want to avoid paying UK tax. Senator Maclean said it had been an ongoing saga for some time, but given the VAT increase this year the UK treasury may now change their mind and decide to collect the money they are losing.","Jersey's internet mail order industry is not under threat, according to the Economic Development Minister."
"Speaking in the States, Senator Ian Gorst said the bargaining process had been exhausted with no room for debate. He said this left no practical alternative other than to bring in the final pay offer for eligible public sector workers. The Public Sector Unions have responded saying they are extremely disappointed and are seeking legal advice. Anne Southern, representing many of Jersey's unions, said their rights were not being recognised. She said her members wanted a 4% pay rise in line with inflation. Senator Gorst has offered States workers a 1% rise for the next two years and a 1% lump sum payment. Senator Gorst said: ""The economic conditions facing Jersey mean we can not offer a higher pay award if we are to meet the priorities agreed by members - creating jobs, maintaining employment and investing in health and social services."" That offer does not apply to nurses, whose pay offer has changed. States nurses have been offered a 1% lump sum in 2012, a 3% increase in 2013 and a 4% increase in 2014. Mrs Southern, from the National Union of Teachers, said the unions would now ballot members on industrial action.","The latest pay deal offered to States workers in Jersey is final, according to the chief minister."
"In February, $9.2m and £750,000 were discovered by Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the EFCC, in a property belonging to Andrew Yakubu, a former director of the national oil company, NNPC. In March, large sacks containing bundles of ""crispy"" banknotes worth a total of $155,000 (£130,000) were found in Kaduna airport. In April, a stash containing $43.4m, £27,800 and 23.2m naira were recovered from a Lagos apartment with its owner yet to be identified. And these are just the tip of the iceberg. Whistle-blowers rewarded EFCC head Ibrahim Magu was quoted in the local media as saying that the total amount recovered by the agency in the past few months was about $53m, £120m and €547m, on top of hundreds of millions of Nigerian naira. He credited this to the whistle-blower policy put in place by the government in December 2016. Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani ""Banks in Nigeria are definitely no longer the best hiding place for unexplained funds."" A particularly juicy sentence stands out from the five-page policy document made available on the ministry of finance website: ""A whistle-blower responsible for providing the government with information that directly leads to the voluntary return of stolen or concealed funds or assets may be entitled to anywhere between 2.5-5% of amount recovered."" There is a special page for submitting tip-offs. Within three months Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun disclosed that they had received 2,351 tips, sent in through phone calls, text messages and emails. Naturally, the policy also promises to protect the identity of all whistle-blowers. Such huge sums of cash as those discovered could not have walked into the residences on their own. The typical Nigerian wealthy man or woman, indisposed to manual labour, would have had to enlist the services of their extended family, minions or hangers-on, to transport the cash. Cashless policy In the past, whistle-blowers or not, it may have been difficult to find any large amounts of cash lying around in Nigeria. The stashes would have been cooling off in banks, or en route to various foreign destinations. But, in 2012, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), under Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, now the Emir of Kano, introduced a ""cashless policy"". This placed limits on the amount of cash-based transfers, encouraging electronic transactions instead. As the CBN notes in the ""Cash-less Nigeria"" section of its website: ""High cash usage enables corruption, leakages and money laundering, amongst other cash-related fraudulent activities."" Imagine the predicament of the serial looters, bribe givers and takers, accustomed to handling incredible amounts of cash. Recent reports, for example, allege that in 2011 a whopping $466m was withdrawn in cash - raw notes and bundles - to pay a few Nigerian government officials to facilitate Shell Petroleum's acquisition of a lucrative oilfield. Shell said it did not believe its employees acted illegally. The CBN's cashless policy would have made it hard for subsequent bribe-takers to deposit such huge sums in banks. Again, the extended family, minions and hangers-on can come to the rescue. People could open different bank accounts in the names of their siblings, aunts and uncles, father, nephew, spouses, in-laws, house girls, cooks, drivers and so on. The heaps of cash can be broken into smaller batches and deposited in these various accounts. Those in whose names the accounts are opened might not have any knowledge of or control over the transactions. Bank verification This short-circuiting of the cashless policy seemed to be working fine, until President Muhammadu Buhari came to power and introduced yet another policy: The Bank Verification Number (BVN) policy. Every bank customer in Nigeria was required to have their biometric details captured and linked to a unique number that could be verified across every account and transaction they made in every bank. The first step to getting a BVN was to turn up at the bank in person. As of November 2016, the Nigerian parliament was set to discuss the billions of local and international currency reportedly abandoned in bank accounts as a result of the BVN policy. Apparently, owners of dubious accounts are afraid to step forward and claim their riches. Banks in Nigeria are definitely no longer the best hiding place for unexplained funds. The $9.2m found in Mr Yakubu's residence was discovered in a fireproof safe. He has sued the EFCC for violating his fundamental human rights, insisting that the money was his - a ""gift from unnamed persons"". After much speculation as to its ownership, the $43.4m found in a Lagos apartment was finally claimed by the Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA), whose director, Ayo Oke, stated that the money was released by the previous government to help with the agency's ""special services"". Mr Buhari has suspended the director from his position and ordered a two-week probe into the origin of the funds. Two years into his tenure, President Buhari's war on corruption is finally producing tangible results - cash - even if there have been no high-profile convictions yet. More from Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:",Nigerians have been shocked and bemused after huge piles of cash have been unearthed in various parts of the country in recent months. Journalist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at what is going on.

"Ms Allred spoke at a press conference alongside three women who said they had been abused by Mr Cosby. Mr Cosby, 77, is facing a series of renewed allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted over a dozen women. His lawyers describe the claims as ""discredited"" and ""defamatory"". Mr Cosby has had television shows cancelled and some appearances dropped in recent weeks amid the allegations. 'Lost count' Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Ms Allred said many of the alleged victims had contacted her to determine what legal rights they had. ""Unfortunately, I had to tell them it was too late for them to file a lawsuit against Bill Cosby because of the statute of limitations - for most women it is simply too late to have their day in court,"" she told reporters. The women's rights lawyer presented two courses of action to, in her words, ""determine whether Bill Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator"". Firstly, she suggested Mr Cosby waive the statute of limitations to allow the alleged victims to present their claims and for him to present his defence. The second option, she said, would be for Mr Cosby to place $100m (£64m) in a fund, from which a panel of retired judges would decide what compensation would be appropriate if a woman's claim was found to have merit. Three women then gave accounts of the alleged attacks, with two saying they had been drugged before being assaulted. When asked how many women had contacted her to make a claim, Ms Allred said: ""I literally have lost count."" The press conference came a day after another woman filed a lawsuit against Mr Cosby over allegations of sexual assault when she was under-age - said to be the first such claim to come to light. Judy Huth says she was 15 when she was molested by the comedian at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. As she was minor at the time, her case can still be heard. Earlier this week, Bill Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia, where he was once a student, amid the allegations. Several broadcasters have also shelved projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix. Two of his performances scheduled for the weekend at a venue in the north of New York were cancelled on Wednesday, AP reports. Nearly half of the audience of the show in Tarrytown had reportedly requested refunds. In 2005 a woman who accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her brought a lawsuit against him, but the case was settled out of court.","Lawyer Gloria Allred has urged US comedian Bill Cosby to waive the statute of limitations to allow women alleging he sexually abused them to ""obtain justice""."
"She told CBS host Stephen Colbert she has launched an exploratory committee for her bid on Tuesday. Mrs Gillibrand, a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement, has made headlines for her sharp criticism of President Trump. She joins a growing group of Democrats hoping to win the party's nomination. ""I'm filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States tonight!"" she said in a clip of her taped interview released ahead of the programme on Tuesday night. Asked why she is running, Mrs Gillibrand, 52, replied: ""As a young mom I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I fight for my own, which is why I believe health care is a right and not a privilege."" Registering an exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission allows Mrs Gillibrand to raise money like a presidential candidate before officially launching her bid. On the late-night programme, she listed healthcare, public schooling and job opportunities as big issues she would fight for - along with ""taking on institutional racism"" and ""the corruption and greed in Washington"". Mrs Gillibrand told reporters during a news conference on Wednesday she has felt a growing ""sense of urgency"" to fight. ""We have to take on President Trump,"" she said. ""He is literally ripping apart the fabric of this country, the moral fabric."" Who is Kirsten Gillibrand? Mrs Gillibrand was appointed to her seat in 2009, when Hillary Clinton accepted the role of US Secretary of State under former president Barack Obama. Since then, she has won her re-election bids easily and remains popular in New York. Mrs Gillibrand has one of the largest financial pools to draw from of possible 2020 candidates, with around $10m (£7.7m) in her campaign pocket following her re-election last year. She is expected to set up her headquarters in Troy, New York, where she lives with her husband and two sons. Her husband, Jonathan, is a British venture capitalist from a wealthy background - his father was a chair at British Aerospace and engineering firm AMEC. Mrs Gillibrand reportedly has key staffers on board and released a campaign ad on Tuesday night. Mrs Gillibrand has been an outspoken supporter for the #MeToo movement as well as advocating for victims of sexual assault on college campuses and in the military. She has also been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. Mrs Gillibrand last year demanded President Trump quit over sexual misconduct allegations. Mr Trump responded by claiming Mrs Gillibrand had come ""begging"" to him for donations and ""would do anything"" for cash. As Democrats decried the language as sexist, the White House said the president was only referring to political corruption. Young, charismatic, and a real contender Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Announcing a presidential campaign on the Stephen Colbert Show may end up a cliché by the time the year is over, but credit Kirsten Gillibrand with being one of the first to try it. The New York senator's decision to (almost) throw her hat into the ring isn't a huge shock. She's long been positioning herself as one of the candidates most likely to capitalise on the #MeToo movement, and her pitch as someone who will ""fight as hard for other people's kids as she would for her own"" just might resonate. Her steady march to 2020 hit a few bumps along the way, however. She angered some Democrats by quickly calling for Senator Al Franken's resignation after he faced sexual harassment charges. And she alienated Clinton loyalists by criticising Bill Clinton's handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. These decisions could hurt her, even if she cites them as evidence that she matches her feminist rhetoric with action. As a New Yorker, however, she can tap into a deep vein of campaign cash. She's young and charismatic. If she catches the wave of women voters that powered Democrats to victory last year, it just might carry her to the nomination. Who else is running? Senator Elizabeth Warren announced her own bid on New Year's Eve. Democratic representatives Tulsi Gabbard and John Delaney have also announced plans to run. Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar have also confirmed they are considering a bid.",New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has announced her plans for a 2020 presidential run during an appearance on late-night television.
"The 12 June summit was called off two weeks ago by Mr Trump but has since been salvaged after a flurry of contacts between the two sides. Mr Trump said on Tuesday that plans were ""moving along very nicely"". The US wants Mr Kim to commit to giving up his nuclear weapons. But it is unclear exactly what is on the table for the discussions in Singapore. Mr Trump has suggested the first meeting will kick off a longer process of negotiations, calling it a ""get-to-know-you situation"". ""A lot of relationships being built, a lot of negotiations going on before the trip,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""It's very important - it'll be a very important couple of days."" The summit would represent the first ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed on Twitter that the summit would take place at the five-star Capella Hotel. But it appears that the two leaders will stay elsewhere. Mr Trump will likely be at the Shangri-La Hotel, where US presidents have stayed before, while Mr Kim will probably stay at the St Regis Singapore, the Straits Times newspaper reports. The two hotels are on the main island, near the famous Orchard Road shopping strip. Sentosa is one of 63 islands that make up Singapore. The 500-hectare island, only a short distance from the main island, is home to luxury resorts, private marinas and plush golf clubs. But the island also has a dark history of piracy, bloodshed and war. It was a pirates' haunt Singapore was established as a British trading post in the 19th Century. Its prime location on the major sea route between India and China made it an ideal choice. But even before British rule, Singapore was a flourishing trade centre, frequented by merchants and traders, as well as pirates. Sentosa was known at that time as Pulau Blakang Mati, which directly translates as the ""island behind death"" - a reference to its violent piracy reputation. The island's population was mostly Malay, Chinese and the Bugis - seafarers originally from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It was a World War Two massacre site Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, after British colonial forces surrendered. It was given a new Japanese name - Syonan, meaning Light of the South. Over the next few years, thousands of people were killed by the occupying forces. Chinese men between the ages of 18 and 50 were summoned to various sites before being machine-gunned to death and thrown into the sea. Among the massacre sites were the beaches on Sentosa, near the Capella hotel where Mr Trump and Mr Kim will meet. Sentosa also hosted a prisoner-of-war camp, which held some 400 Allied troops and gunners. Tourism boom and fatal accidents In the 1970s, the Singaporean government renamed the island Sentosa, meaning ""peace and tranquillity"", and began developing it as a tourism site. But the island's problems continued. In 1983, two carriages on the tourist cable car plunged into the sea after an oil drilling vessel struck the ropeway. A water park was opened - Fantasy Island - but was plagued by safety complaints. An eight-year-old girl died there in 2000 when her raft overturned. The park closed in 2002. Sentosa has since re-invented itself as the ""State of Fun"". A Universal Studios theme park, a new water park and the Resorts World casino draw in thousands of Singaporeans and tourists each year. The luxury backdrop to the talks The 30-acre, 112-room Capella resort, nestled in tropical rainforest and designed by the firm of renowned British architect Norman Foster, features several grand colonial-era buildings. It describes itself as a place ""where old and new fuse together in luxury"". Rooms are on offer from about $500 a night (£370) for a Premier Garden King Room to $7,500 a night (£5,600) for the Colonial Manor with three bedrooms and a private pool. White House staff have already had a preview of the venue, with Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Joe Hagin and other officials staying there as they have hammered out the details of the summit. However, visitors hoping to grab a ringside seat will be disappointed. There are no rooms available from now until 15 June. Playground of the rich and famous Sentosa is home to one of the country's most prestigious residential enclaves - Sentosa Cove, where multi-million dollar homes with yacht docks can be found. There is also an award-winning golf club with two courses, some of Singapore's most luxurious hotels and a handful of Michelin-starred restaurants. So why Sentosa? The island's location, just off the mainland, makes it a secure venue. Access to the island can easily be controlled - there is just a cable car, a monorail, a pedestrian causeway and a vehicle tunnel. And should the world leaders want a break from their historic talks, did we mention the golf courses?","The much-anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will take place at a hotel on the Singaporean island of Sentosa, the White House has confirmed."
"There were fresh protests on Sunday, the seventh anniversary of the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Emergency government meetings have been held in response to the protests, which have seen more than 800 arrests. President Beji Caid Essebsi visited a district of Tunis on Sunday, saying he understood the people's suffering. Protesters have taken to the streets again following calls from opposition parties. They argue conditions have not improved since Ben Ali was deposed as president at the start of the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. When did the protests begin and what caused them? Demonstrations began on 7 January after the government raised value-added tax and social contributions, and increased some prices on goods in its 2018 budget. Rallies have taken place in at least 10 different areas. On Sunday, hundreds of people poured into one of the flashpoints of the 2011 uprising, Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunis. Demonstrators also rallied outside the offices of the UGTT union, demanding the budget be abandoned and venting anger at price rises. Last week saw a wave of protests, some of which turned violent after dark. The government accused demonstrators of setting fire to police cars and attacking officials. Some people tried to take over shopping malls and stores, while others blocked roads. In the town of Thala, near the Algerian border, the army was called in on Wednesday after protesters burned down the national security offices and police were forced to retreat. Interior ministry spokesman Khlifa Chibani said on Saturday that 803 people had been arrested so far on suspicion of violence, theft and looting. He said 97 members of the security forces had been injured, but did not say how many protesters had been hurt. Demonstrators accused police of a violent crackdown. What are the reforms being promised? The announcement came after two hours of crisis talks at the presidential palace that included President Essebsi, political parties and trade unionists. Officials said plans had been submitted to parliament to reform medical care, housing and increase aid to the poor. Social affairs minister Mohammed Trabelsi said the government proposed increasing welfare payments to those in need by 170m dinars ($70m; £50m). ""This will affect about 250,000 families. It will help the poor and middle class,"" he said. Mr Trabelsi also alluded to plans for guaranteed medical care and housing reform. What did Mr Essebsi say on Sunday? He visited the marginalised Tunis district of Ettdhamon, opening a youth centre there. In a short and informal speech, he promised to address youth unemployment and highlighted the government's move to help poorer families, saying: ""We feel for you, these are our families."" But he also said: ""Be modest, your country does not have a lot of means."" What is Tunisia's economic situation? Tunisia has been struggling economically since Ben Ali was ousted after more than 20 years in power. That revolution was sparked by high unemployment and worries about corruption. Seven years on, some of the same problems remain. Youth unemployment stands at more than 35%, the UN's International Labour Organisation says. Terror attacks that hit the country's vital tourism industry have helped knock its currency down 60% since 2011. Inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high, with the price of meat and other foods rising by more than 10% annually. In December 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told Tunisia it needed to take ""urgent action"" and ""decisive measures"" to reduce its deficit. The IMF gave the country a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) loan in 2015. Ben Ali, who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia by a Tunisian court in 2011 of embezzlement and misuse of public funds and sentenced to 35 years.","The Tunisian government has announced a wave of social reforms, reacting to days of demonstrations by anti-austerity protesters."
"Police used tear gas on Tuesday to end three days of unrest sparked by the death of an Iranian asylum seeker. CCTV images appear to show two detainees, one armed with a machete, lighting and throwing a petrol bomb. Photos of the aftermath show broken windows, ransacked offices and smashed equipment. The unrest began on Sunday after an escaped detainee was found dead. Inmates started fires and barricaded themselves inside a compound with weapons. Meanwhile, a Border Force spokesperson confirmed that seven detainees who allegedly participated in the unrest were being transferred from Christmas Island to Australia's mainland. ""The detainees are travelling on a charter flight accompanied by security officers. Restraints are used where appropriate for the safety and security of detainees, staff and the aircraft,"" a statement provided to the BBC said. Christmas Island is a remote Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, 2,650km (1,650 miles) north-west of Perth. The facility houses asylum seekers alongside people, including New Zealand citizens, whose Australian visas have been cancelled after they committed crimes. Dutton defends policy Australia's immigration minister Peter Dutton earlier defended housing asylum seekers with ""serious criminals"" at the detention centre. Mr Dutton told the ABC that the asylum seekers held at the compound with the convicted criminals - including the New Zealand nationals - were only sent there after risk assessments. ""Some [asylum seekers] have had an extreme threat assessment worked up and that's as a result of their own behaviour,"" he said during a radio interview. ""That is the basis on which the [Australian] Border Force officers make a decision about whether somebody is at a high security facility or whether they are at a low-security arrangement."" He blamed the unrest on ""a hardened criminal population that occupies the immigration detention centre"". He also rejected suggestions that some of the New Zealanders held at the camp had only been convicted of minor crimes such as shoplifting and traffic offences. Under controversial policies, Australia sends all intercepted asylum seekers to Christmas Island as well as Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific.",The Australian government has released pictures showing the riot at Christmas Island migrant detention centre earlier this week and its aftermath.
"By Bethany BellBBC News, Udine, north-east Italy They looked nervous and out of place, among the cyclists and tourists heading south. One looked Arab, the other Pakistani or Afghan. From time to time, they glanced around furtively. When the train arrived, they boarded separately and sat in different compartments. Half an hour later, the train crossed into Italy, and stopped at Tarvisio station in the Alps. Italian border police got on the train - and pulled the two men off, probably because they did not have proper documents. It is likely that they claimed asylum in Italy, and were brought to the city of Udine, about 100km (62 miles) further south, to be processed. While most migrants coming to Europe try to head north to countries like Germany or Sweden, in this region of northern Italy the flow is in the other direction. ""From the beginning of January 2016, there have been about 5,000 migrants coming via Austria to Italy, to Udine,"" said Udine provincial prefect Vittorio Zappalorto. ""Mostly they come here because their application for asylum is not accepted in other countries."" He says about 90% of them are from Pakistan or Afghanistan. The overwhelming majority are young men. Deported Udine, home to 100,000 people, has struggled to cope with the stream of new arrivals. Two years ago, many of them had to sleep rough. The city has now set up shelters in flats and at two old army barracks, where the asylum seekers are fed and housed. At one of them, the Caserma Friuli, I met Salaam, a 25-year-old Afghan. He said that in 2009 he lived in Britain, but was sent back to Afghanistan. In May, he arrived in Udine, via the western Balkan route. When I asked him why he had not applied for asylum in Austria or elsewhere he said he had heard that in Italy ""they give you documents"". The mayor of Udine, Furio Honsell, said many migrants seem to be coming here as a last resort. ""People come here because they think that in Italy there is an option,"" he said. ""You can either get asylum or what it is called temporary protection or humanitarian protection, and it allows them probably to go back to other countries where they can get a job. ""The situation is chaotic. These people are orbiting Europe trying to build a life for themselves."" Europe's migrant crisis: Mr Honsell says that according to Italian law, just about anybody who is on Italian land can apply for asylum and can appeal twice if their case is turned down. ""This sets up a process where people stay here,"" he said. ""There is basically no deportation in Italy."" Mr Honsell says there is not much work for the migrants in Udine, which is in the grip of a recession. Many spend their days hanging out in the city's Venetian centre, using the town's free wi-fi - something that upsets some of the locals. ""They do nothing,"" one man told me. ""They have no respect for us, their hosts. It is not true that they all come from war-torn countries. There are people who shouldn't be here."" A volunteer association, Ospiti in Arrivo, is trying to bridge the gap by offering free Italian lessons. One of their students, Hassan from Pakistan, told me that although ""the standard of living isn't very good"", Italy is the only EU country that ""can give you a future, because after two or three years they will give you papers"". But surviving the long waiting process is harsh - and getting papers is not guaranteed. Many may eventually join the ranks of Italy's undocumented migrants, the ""clandestini"". Volunteers from Ospiti in Arrivo regularly check Udine's train station and its parks to help migrants who are trying to enter the asylum system or who have fallen out of it. In one park, we met Abdullah from Afghanistan. He told us he had been sleeping there for a month, because he had lost his ID and had been refused re-entry to a local shelter because he had gone to Milan for a few months. The volunteers gave him tea, biscuits and a blanket and advised him to visit the charity, Caritas, the next day. ""It is not easy to live here illegally,"" Lisa, one of the volunteers told me. ""I don't know if people really want this, sleeping in the park or not having a job. ""We think people are coming here because of war and violence, not because we are kind.

We don't want them to be illegal.""","Two men stood on the platform at Villach station in south-east Austria, waiting for the local train to Udine in Italy - not far across the border."
"Sharbat Gula could face a fine and up to 14 years in jail. Officials say she was arrested by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) after a two-year probe in Peshawar, near the Afghan border. Pakistan recently launched a crackdown against fake IDs. Mrs Gula allegedly applied for an identity card in April 2014, using the name Sharbat Bibi. If the fraud claims are true, she is one of thousands of Afghan refugees living in Pakistan who have tried to dodge its computerised system. More on Afghanistan The Afghans forced to go home Afghanistan's looming refugee disaster Thirty abducted Afghan civilians killed An official from the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) said the FIA was seeking three staff who had issued Mrs Gula's ID. They have been missing since the alleged fraud was reported. Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reports that ID cards were issued to Mrs Gula and two men who claimed to be her sons. A Nadra source told the paper: ""They may not be her sons, but this is a common practice among Afghan refugees whereby they list names of non-relatives as their children to obtain documents."" The celebrated ""Afghan girl"" picture of Mrs Gula was taken in 1984 in a refugee camp in north-west Pakistan, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It led to one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed. In 2002, photographer Steve McCurry tracked his subject down after 17 years of searching. At that time, Mrs Gula was living in a remote Afghan village with her baker husband and three daughters. After hearing rumours of Mrs Gula's arrest, Mr McCurry posted the iconic picture on Instagram and wrote: ""Two hours ago, I got word from a friend in Peshawar, Pakistan, that Sharbat Gula has been arrested. We are doing everything we can to get the facts by contacting our colleagues and friends in the area. ""I am committed to doing anything and everything possible to provide legal and financial support for her and her family. ""I object to this action by the authorities in the strongest possible terms. She has suffered throughout her entire life, and her arrest is an egregious violation of her human rights."" Pakistan's push against foreigners getting fake ID cards through fraud has detected 60,675 cards in the hands of non-nationals, officials say. Recent UN figures show that Pakistan hosts 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees. A further one million unregistered refugees are believed to be in the country.","An Afghan woman immortalised on the cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985 as a green-eyed 12-year-old has been arrested in Pakistan for holding fake identity papers, officials say."
"The Jersey Homelessness Strategic Board's review aimed to help understand the issue and how to tackle it. The first priority in the Jersey Homelessness Strategy is to establish a legal definition for homelessness. Among the other seven key areas are strengthening support services, improving social housing supply and producing better data. The board was set up in May 2019 and commissioned a review between 2019 and 2020 to assess the problem. The Jersey Homelessness Strategy aims to end homelessness in the island by tackling both the ""visible form"" of rough sleeping and the ""less obvious"" challenges of housing access, unsuitable or unsafe accommodation and eviction threats. Guy Le Maistre, vice chairman of The Shelter Trust, said: ""At the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak, the demand for temporary or emergency shelter shot up rapidly, and there were too many people for the hostels to cope with and for people to be able to socially distance. ""Different organisations worked together to quickly find additional accommodation as a temporary solution. This was a real positive, but we need to have permanent measures in place to resolve the ongoing problem."" The priorities are: The exact number of homeless is not given in the strategy, with developing a more ""robust evidence base"" also identified as a key aim. However, a survey informing the review had 121 homeless respondents. The report found ""fairly significant numbers of individuals are rough sleeping regularly"" and an average of 104 people each night were living in temporary or supported accommodation from the charitable sector. Board chair Simon Burgess explained there was no central service for people who find themselves homeless or in insecure accommodation to go to for help. He said: ""We have seen instances of extremely vulnerable people being placed into totally inappropriate accommodation, sometimes due to the lack of knowing of what to do.

"Born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1959, Mr Harper became involved in politics while still at school. After obtaining a masters degree from the University of Calgary he went on to work as a political aide. Mr Harper won a parliamentary seat for the Reform Party in 1993, but quit four years later to work for a conservative lobby group. He returned to parliament in 2002 as head of the Canadian Alliance and leader of the opposition. A year later his party merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Hardliner to progressive The new Conservative Party, with Mr Harper at the helm, reunited Canada's political right after years of disarray. But the father-of-two could not beat Liberal Party leader Paul Martin in the 2004 election, and Mr Martin was able to form a minority government. Observers say the Conservative Party's controversial statements on abortion and same-sex marriage lost them key votes on that occasion. Next time around, Mr Harper - a keen strategist - managed to marginalise the more extreme elements of his party. His election as Canada's prime minister in 2006 reversed more than a decade of Liberal Party rule in parliament. It also completed Mr Harper's transformation from hard-line right-winger to a progressive conservative with a party positioned at the centre of the political spectrum. Sometimes seen as an aloof figure more at home with a spreadsheet than working a crowd, the Alberta MP managed to stay at the helm of a minority government longer than expected. Accusations that he was a pro-Bush ""extremist"" who would curb abortion rights and put an end to same-sex marriages failed to stick. But he was also helped by the disarray among the opposition Liberals and a perceived lack of appetite among Canadians to head back to the polls. After two years he called for a snap poll a year ahead of schedule, complaining that parliament was ""dysfunctional"" and deadlocked. In the 2008 election he increased his party's seats but still fell short of holding a majority. But he received a fillip the following year when the newly-inaugurated Barack Obama chose Canada as the destination for his first foreign trip as US president. Mr Harper received a lot of criticism in 2010 over the $1.1bn cost (US$1.1bn; £730m) of staging the double summit of G8 and G20 leaders in Toronto. A temporary water feature dubbed the ""fake lake"" came to symbolise what many critics saw as Mr Harper's extravagant spending. By the time his opponents triggered the 2011 election, though, Mr Harper was able to present himself as the stable, familiar guiding hand of Canadian politics. His measured campaign messages clearly hit home, and with the Conservatives' political rivals failing to challenge them in the polls, Mr Harper was able to secure the majority that had previously eluded him. Under Mr Harper the party took 54% of the seats in parliament, securing a third consecutive term and transforming their minority government into a majority. Mr Harper ran a tightly focused campaign concentrating largely on his government's record in managing the economy, which had emerged from a recession as one of the strongest among the G7 group of countries. But four years later, it's the economy that proved his Achilles heel, with the country officially entering recession at the start of the election campaign. He was under fire for his low spending, low taxes policies, and was at odds with his political opponents over the bombing campaign against Islamic State in Syria. A lone gunman attack on the parliament building in Ottawa proved to be a pivotal moment. Mr Harper pushed through Bill C-51, which increased policing and surveillance powers despite an outcry from civil liberty campaigners. He lost the election to the fresh-faced, energetic Justin Trudeau, and resigned as Conservative leader. Ten months later, he quit his seat in Calgary, signalling the end of his decades-long association with politics, to focus on business interests.","After three election victories and 10 years leading the country, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper has left Canadian politics, upon which he left such an indelible mark."
"By Victoria BissetBBC News But a coronavirus outbreak at the University of Washington in Seattle has raised questions about the pressures the pandemic places on the organisations. At least 128 students living in fraternity accommodation at the university have tested positive for Covid-19, as well as nine of their close contacts. This number could rise, as more than 1,300 tests have been conducted during the past week. So what challenges does coronavirus pose for fraternities and sororities - collectively known as ""the Greek life"" - and how are they preparing for the new academic year? What outbreaks have there been? A fraternity is an organisation at a college or university, founded on a set of principles that members must abide by and mostly designated by a grouping of Greek letters. They form an integral part of students' social lives and also offer accommodation. Fraternities are usually - but not always - made up of male students, while female organisations tend to be known as sororities. According to one report, 9.1% of new students in 2019 said there was a ""very good chance"" they would join one. In addition to the cases at the University of Washington, about a dozen coronavirus cases have also been reported among students and members of staff living in fraternity or sorority accommodation at Georgia Tech in Atlanta since late March, including four in the last week. In each case the university said residents had been notified, but did not offer any detail about which of its 56 Greek-named organisations were affected. Meanwhile, Mississippi's state health officer said last month that parties held by local fraternities had been linked to a number of cases, according to US media. US authorities have noted that many of the new cases recorded in southern states have been among younger age groups. Although young people are not among the most at-risk groups during the pandemic, they are more likely to spread the virus. What precautions are being taken? ""Any communal living facilities are going to face challenges with preventing the spread of the coronavirus, which is why we saw nursing homes and cruise ships become major hotspots for Covid-19 early on,"" Erik Johnson, the president of the University of Washington's Interfraternity Council, told the BBC. He said precautions had already been taken before the cases at the university were reported, including reduced occupancy in fraternity accommodation over the summer. ""Once we had realised we were dealing with an outbreak, all recruitment was put on pause, our social moratorium was reinforced, and everyone was ordered to be tested immediately,"" Mr Johnson said. While the University of Washington faces an unusual situation because its fraternity accommodation remains open over the summer, many fraternities and sororities are now trying to decide which measures to put in place before the new academic year begins. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, just over half of US universities are currently planning a full return to in-person teaching in the autumn, although this could change. Some national fraternities and sororities have said they will leave the decision about how and when to reopen to their local branches, as health advice varies between both states and universities, and the situation is changing rapidly. Others have not been able to finalise their own plans. ""We are still awaiting information on how and when it will be possible to open,"" the facility company of Gamma Phi Beta, the country's oldest sorority, has said. However, another sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, says it plans to open its houses in the new academic year where possible. While it advises its chapters to follow state and university guidelines on issues such as the numbers of students permitted to live in each room, the sorority has introduced its own rules, including requirements that each member take their own temperature on a daily basis and wear a mask in common areas of the house. Those who test positive, meanwhile, will not be allowed to self-quarantine inside the sorority house. How are they coping? While larger organisations are likely to be able to reach and enforce similar decisions, smaller fraternities and sororities may struggle to deal with the costs of extensive cleaning and other aspects of the pandemic, according to the North American Interfraternity Conference, which represents 60 fraternities. Housing is not the only aspect of Greek life to be affected by the pandemic - the process of recruiting and inducting new members has also changed. According to the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), a body which oversees 26 sororities, the main annual recruitment period normally lasts between three days and a week and ""gives participants the opportunity to meet the entire sorority community on your campus"". After these events, students are invited to take part in challenges before being accepted as members of the organisation. While the pandemic has meant many events have moved online or been postponed, it hasn't lessened their importance. ""We must communicate the value of the sorority experience, highlighting the continued relevance and power of sorority during this time of physical separation,"" the NPC said on its website. It has joined other organisations in turning to social media and messaging apps to find new members. The oldest society in the US, Phi Beta Kappa, says it will work with chapters wishing to hold virtual induction ceremonies but adds that even new recruits unable to attend an induction will still be able to register and become members online. As an academically selective organisation, the society has also called on chapters to take into account the ""many challenges that are affecting this semester"" when assessing students' grades.",Fraternities and sororities form a central part of the university experience for many US students.
"The drills, called Balikatan (Shoulder to Shoulder), take place every year. These exercises come a week after a military pact to increase the US troop presence in the country was signed. Visiting Manila last week, US President Barack Obama pledged ""ironclad"" backing for the Philippines, which is engaged in a maritime dispute with China. The two countries have competing claims over a number of islands and shoals in the South China Sea, such as Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. The South East Asian nation has asked a United Nations arbitration tribunal to rule on the issue. At Balikatan's opening ceremony, Filipino Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said it was necessary to deal with ""aggressive"" neighbours intent on ""changing the status quo"", without mentioning China. He said the 10-day drills would focus on maritime capabilities. They would also include live-fire and maritime surveillance exercises, the Philippine military said. Its public affairs office chief, Ramon Zagala, however, sought to play down Balikatan's significance, saying it was ""not related to any current situation"". Instead, it was aimed at improving ""tactical-level military proficiency"" and enhancing US-Filipino co-operation, he said. The military exercise would also focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster response. Military personnel from both countries will offer free medical, dental and veterinary care in Legazpi City, and build and repair infrastructure such as schools in Bicol. As tensions with China have grown, the US and the Philippines have moved to increase co-operation. Last week, Washington and Manila signed a deal allowing US troops better access to military bases, ports and airfields. This exercise comes amid reports China has sent more ships to an area disputed with the Philippines. Over the weekend, Philippine media reported the sighting of more Chinese vessels near Second Thomas Shoal, as the Philippine military air-dropped provisions to its troops stationed on a rusting vessel beached there. Vietnam clashes with China over oil rig Meanwhile, Vietnam has protested against a plan by China to move its first deep-water drilling rig into an area which Vietnam claims as its territory. China's maritime safety authority announced on Saturday that the oil rig Haiyang Shiyou 981 would be drilling in an area located 120 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam until 15 August. It prohibited ships from entering within one mile of the rig. On Sunday, Vietnam's foreign ministry spokesman Le Hai Binh insisted that this area belonged to them. Any activity by foreign countries conducted in Vietnam's waters without its permission would be considered ""illegal and worthless"" and would be ""resolutely opposed"" by Vietnam's government, he said. State oil and gas group PetroVietnam also sent a letter of objection to China's state-run oil company CNOOC, demanding they immediately pull out the rig. In response, China on Monday expanded the prohibited area to three miles.","About 5,500 troops from the United States and the Philippines have begun a military exercise, amid tensions between Manila and China."
"Guernsey Mind said it hoped to encourage five large and two small employers to adopt mental health policies by April 2013. Training will be offered to HR staff to help them avoid discrimination. Emily Litten, a spokeswoman for the charity, said: ""We know that 33% of invalidity benefit claims in 2010 were down to mental health related issues."" As well as making employers more aware of the mental health of their staff, the project aims to develop a self-help, training and support network for individuals trying to get back into work. Ms Litten said: ""We're not talking about discriminating in favour of people with mental health issues but trying to ensure they can work in a more equal way."" Street sofa Guernsey Mind is affiliated to the national charity Mind, which has made mental health in the working environment its main focus for ""Mind Week"" from 14 May. As part of its Taking Care of Business campaign, the charity has decided to take a sofa into the streets of St Peter Port during lunchtimes to invite people to sit down for a chat about any work-related stress they may face. Venues include Market Square, the Weybridge Clock Tower and outside the Town Church. Maggie Costen, the chair of Guernsey Mind, said: ""Everyone has their stressful days at work but if your job is causing you distress over a sustained period of time, this can have a very damaging effect on your mental health.

"By Fergal KeaneBBC's Africa editor Even when the crowds were at their largest and most joyous there was a sense of looming danger. You did not have to walk far from the sit-in to encounter the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) lounging on their pick-up trucks. Unlike the regular army these militiamen rarely responded to greetings or if they did it was with a non-committal nod, no hint of a smile. It did not surprise me. I remembered them from Darfur 14 years before. There they were known as the Janjaweed and became notorious for atrocities inflicted on the civilian population. In 2005 I saw them beat and terrorise civilians in a camp for the displaced and I interviewed the survivors of torture and rape. Now they have brought their violence to the streets of the capital. Sudan has been driven backwards by the conspiracy of a military elite whose priority is the survival of their power and privilege. The Transitional Military Council has scrapped the agreements reached with the opposition Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) under the guise of speeding up the transition to full democratic elections. These are to be held within nine months. More on Sudan The plan is more than likely a fiction, not designed to produce civilian rule or anything like it. There is ample precedent in Africa and elsewhere these days for elections which go through the motions of democracy but deliver none of its substance. Don't be surprised to see senior figures from the TMC ""retiring"" from the military and standing as civilian candidates. What will not change is military control of Sudanese life. In part the FFC and its civil society allies are victims of their own dizzying success in the early days of the revolution. Within 24 hours they toppled President Omar al-Bashir and the military man who led the coup against him. Thirty years of rule appeared to have been vanquished. The sight of the sit-in drew activists from all spheres of Sudanese life. It became a citadel of freedom. The atmosphere was intoxicating. People debated and sang and produced art. They produced manifestos on women's rights, media freedom, justice and the economy, and much more besides. Yet diversity was also a vulnerability. Everybody agreed that civilian rule was the essential demand. But there were inevitable differences over the specifics of achieving that aim: what should the timeframe be, what would be the balance between military and civilian representatives, which personalities representing which groupings would take positions in any transitional arrangements? None of these debates were in themselves fatal to the cause. But they highlighted the difficulties of being a ""people's movement"" compared to an established political party with the structures and internal discipline to make swift changes at the negotiating table. Hard line take control There was another problem. As the shockwaves of Mr Bashir's overthrow dissipated the old politics of Sudan re-emerged. Parties and personalities who had been suppressed under dictatorship were determined not to be left out if political power was being shared. This allowed the military to characterise the protesters as simply one of the groups who were part of the negotiations, ignoring the fact that there would have been no negotiations without the demonstrations. Road to transition Delaying or dissembling in the name of inclusivity became a tactic. Once the military had recovered from the confusion around Mr Bashir's overthrow it regrouped and the most hard line elements took control. This explains the pre-eminence of the RSF commander, Mohammed ""Hemeti"" Hamadan whose personal ruthlessness in Darfur always made him the most likely leader of a counter-revolution. Unlike many of the military elite ""Hemeti"" is an outsider. From a rural background he has no family ties or sentimental affiliation with the young middle class protesting on the streets of the Khartoum. Divided world The military also enjoys another big advantage. This is an age of international division. The notion of an ""international community"" which might pressure the regime is a fantasy. The world is now governed by a collection of interests - occasionally they are complementary, more often they are in competition. The UN Security Council is not a forum where any kind of concerted action on Sudan might be approved. Russia and China would block any move to increase sanctions on Khartoum. The condemnation from US National Security Advisor, John Bolton - he called the Khartoum violence ""abhorrent"" - will only mean something if the US demands that its regional allies - Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - exert pressure on the Sudanese military. For now it is hard to imagine President Donald Trump picking up the phone to Cairo or Riyadh and insisting on a swift transition to civilian rule. Mr Trump has other priorities like the Mexican border, Venezuela, Iran and the trade war with China. What about an African solution? The African Union (AU) was an early supporter of civilian rule after the fall of Mr Bashir but the AU's actions around the election results in the Democratic Republic of Congo in January are cautionary: the AU first criticised what many observers saw as a fix but then rowed back. In recent weeks the African body has spoken of the need for international actors not to meddle in Sudanese affairs. Bear in mind too that the AU's current chairperson is Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who is himself a symbol of military usurpation of power. The Sudan crisis exposes the dominant reality of the international scene. Force can have its way without consequence if the killers and torturers represent a valuable enough asset to other stronger powers - in strategic, ideological, intelligence or economic terms. It is possible that President Trump will make a stand on Sudan and pressure his allies to act, that the AU will threaten to expel and isolate Sudan, that more moderate elements in the military will emerge and challenge ""Hemeti"" and his supporters. Possible. But certainly not probable. I remember speaking with a leading activist at the demonstrations back in April. He told me that ""the sit-in is the only card we have. That is why we have to maintain it."" But now that the sit-in is smashed where does the opposition go? The peaceful revolutionaries are beaten and traumatised. It is impossible to say now whether the Forces of Freedom and Change can come back as a street-driven force. There have been calls for civil disobedience and strikes. Any such will likely be met with ruthless violence. What will not change, in fact what has been deepened, is the alienation of people from their rulers. Repression may work as a strategy for now but not indefinitely. Sudan is now dependent on powerful neighbours for its economic survival and beset by internal divisions. Dependency on the Egyptians and Saudis will rankle with many Sudanese beyond the protesters, adding a more overtly nationalist dimension to the current crisis. The generals have succeeded in smashing the protest but their troubles may only be starting.",Sudan's military has faced mounting international condemnation for its violent attack on protesters which reportedly left at least 30 dead. But there were clear signs this was likely to happen.
"Award-winning journalist Javier Valdez was shot dead on Monday, close to the offices of the newspaper he had founded in his home state, Sinaloa. He had spent his career investigating drug cartels and had been repeatedly threatened. He is one of several journalists who have been killed in Mexico this year. In Mexico City on Tuesday, protesters wrote ""They are killing us"" and ""No to silence"" - a phrase used by Mr Valdez - on the road next to the iconic Monument to Independence on the main thoroughfare, Paseo de la Reforma. Those who were there in person held images of Mr Valdez, while others stuck in their office worked below his projected image on a big screen. Judith Calderón Gómez, the head of journalists' lobby group Casa de los Derechos de Periodistas, told those present that prosecutions had only happened in 0.03% of cases. She called on the government to ""give a real sign they are interested in guaranteeing journalism in the country"". BBC Mundo's Juan Paullier, who met Mr Valdez once, said he was ""a charming, brave and respected man"" and his death was ""a terrible loss for Mexico's embattled journalism"". ""He wanted to tell the stories and dreams of the victims,"" he said, and "" in a country where impunity is the norm, the only certainty seems to be that cases like this won't stop"". Mexican news outlets Animal Político and Tercera Vía are going on strike on Wednesday to protest against the murder, and the ongoing risks to reporters. Last week, Mexico appointed a new prosecutor to investigate crimes against freedom of expression - including the killing of journalists. Mr Valdez had once said: ""The government couldn't care less. They do nothing to protect you. There have been many cases and this keeps happening."" Speaking at a launch of his book last year, Mr Valdez said being a journalist ""is like being on a blacklist"" and that gangs ""will decide what day they are going to kill you"". In March, after journalist Miroslava Breach was shot dead, Valdez was quoted as saying ""No to silence"" and ""Let them kill us all"". Like Valdez, Breach had reported on organised crime, drug-trafficking and corruption. Other Mexican journalists killed this year include freelancers Maximino Rodríguez and Cecilio Pineda Birto, according to the CPJ. The CPJ says at least 40 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 1992. During his career spanning nearly three decades, Mr Valdez wrote extensively on drug-trafficking and organised crime in Mexico, including the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel. The cartel is believed to be responsible for an estimated 25% of all illegal drugs that enter the US via Mexico. Its former head Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was recaptured in 2016, following two jail breaks, and was extradited to the US in January. Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto condemned the killing, calling it an ""outrageous crime"", and added that his government remained committed to press freedom. Sinaloa state attorney general Juan Jose Rios said the death was being investigated, and Valdez's family and colleagues would be protected. More journalists are killed in Mexico every year than in any other country that does not have a continuing war. The only countries where more journalists are killed are Syria and Afghanistan, according to the group Reporters Without Borders (RSF).",Journalists in Mexico have protested against the killing of one of their colleagues and called on the government to take action.
"Taib Cherkaoui said the bodies were discovered in the northern town of al-Hoceima. He said the protests in al-Hoceima and other towns and cities were peaceful, but added that acts of vandalism and looting took place after the rallies. The protesters demanded that King Mohammed VI give up some of his power. So far there has been no independent confirmation of the deaths in al-Hoceima, and it is not clear how the five may have died. Problems lurking Journalist Sietske de Boer in al-Hoceima told the BBC that crowds of young men came from outside the town and began ransacking banks, shops and government buildings on Sunday. Protests have spread across the region since popular movements in Tunisia and Egypt forced out leaders. However, analysts say that - unlike other countries that have seen protests - Morocco has a successful economy, an elected parliament and a reformist monarchy, making it less vulnerable to a major uprising. Former BBC Morocco correspondent Richard Hamilton says regular protests are allowed and the government has promised to double food subsidies. But beneath the surface real problems are lurking, he adds. Morocco has a huge young population, many of them poor or unemployed. The gap between rich and poor has been described by one commentator as ""obscene"" and parliamentary elections are said by critics to be a fig leaf for an undemocratic system, our correspondent says. King Mohammed is a member of the Alawite dynasty that has been ruling Morocco for some 350 years, claiming a direct line of descent from the Prophet Muhammad. It is regarded as almost sacrilegious to question his role as king, our correspondent says.","Five burned bodies have been found in a bank which was set on fire following anti-government protests in Morocco on Sunday, the interior minister has said."
"As head of the intelligence branch of the Internal Security Forces (ISF) he did not have a political role, but was still a key player in the opposition 14 March bloc. Born in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in 1965, he spent the early part of his career looking after the security of Sunni leader and former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. He rose up through the ranks to become head of the prime minister's guard detachment in 2001. A few years after Hariri's death in a massive car bomb in 2005, there were reports that Mr Hassan was suspected of involvement. As Mr Hariri's chief of protocol, he would normally have been in the convoy that was hit by the blast but had taken the day off to take a university exam. UN investigators were reported in 2010 to have found this alibi unlikely, but Mr Hariri's son Saad said he had always had full confidence in Mr Hassan. The following year, Mr Hassan was not among those indicted by the UN-backed tribunal. Instead, prosecutors sought the arrest of four members of the pro-Syrian Shia Islamist movement, Hezbollah. Elias Muhanna, a professor at Brown University in the US and editor of the Qifa Nabki blog on Lebanese politics, said the allegations were a ""strange, unexplained aspect"" of Mr Hassan's past, but had not dented his standing in the Sunni community. He said the brigader-general was a high-profile figure, someone seen as a ""protector of Sunni interests and an integral part of 14 March"". Mr Hassan's branch of the ISF was perceived as being strongly anti-Syrian, in line with 14 March's politics. In 2005, he led an investigation into the death of Mr Hariri which implicated the Syrians, who at that time still had a military presence in Lebanon. He had been in the news again recently following the arrest of pro-Syrian politician and former Information Minister Michel Samaha. The Christian ex-minister was detained at his summer residence in August, accused of having explosives and making plans to target Sunni leaders supporting the opposition in Syria. Following Wissam al-Hassan's death in a car bomb in Beirut's Ashrafiya district on 19 October, Saad Hariri and a number of other Lebanese political leaders directly accused the Syrians of being behind the attack.",Brig Gen Wissam al-Hassan was viewed as one of the leading Sunni figures in Lebanon.

The cathedral was consecrated in 1980, having been formally called the parish church of German since 1879. It now serves as the Cathedral for the Church of England diocese of Sodor and Man, which covers the whole island. The Princess Royal has agreed to be patron until 2018. The campaign has already seen work undertaken to repoint walls, repair windows and landscape the grounds. She arrived by helicopter at Noble's Park in Douglas at 11:00 BST and will visit an aerospace company in Onchan afterwards.",The Princess Royal has arrived on the Isle of Man to attend a Service of Thanksgiving at Peel Cathedral.
"It was the second time he had taken the oath after his formal inauguration was delayed by the reluctance of his predecessor to leave office. ""This is a victory for democracy,"" he told a full stadium of his countrymen near the capital Banjul. ""Few people would have thought that I'd be standing here today,"" he said. He told the crowd that Gambian people now had the power to control their own destiny and that he was going to free political prisoners and improve press freedom. ""For 22 years, the Gambian people yearned to live in a country where our diverse tribes will be bridged by tolerance and our determination to work together for the common good,"" he said. ""One Gambia, one nation, one people."" Mr Barrow, 51, talked of pressing economic challenges left over from the rule of his predecessor, Yahya Jammeh. ""We have inherited an economy in decline,"" the new president said, and promised to attract investment in the technology sector, introduce free primary education and strengthen the judiciary. ""Gambia has changed forever. The people are fully conscious that they can put a government in office as well as remove it."" The president's first swearing-in was at a low-key event at the country's embassy in Senegal last month, after the lengthy power struggle forced him into exile. Crowds on Saturday had queued through the night to get a good spot inside the Independence Stadium. Brass bands began playing ahead of the event and flags waved. Mr Barrow is only the third president in the history of The Gambia, and the celebrations also mark 52 years of the west African country's independence. Mr Jammeh was voted out in December but he only agreed to step aside when regional powers sent in troops ready to remove him by force. He has since fled to Equatorial Guinea. The Gambia is now set to rejoin international institutions such as the International Criminal Court and the Commonwealth. Mr Barrow, a successful property developer who has never held public office, defied the odds by winning the election. Speaking to the BBC just before the election, he said that Gambians ""had been suffering for 22 years"" and were ready for change. His predecessor had once told the BBC he would rule for a billion years, if necessary.","The Gambia has formally sworn in its new elected President, Adama Barrow, in front of a crowd of thousands including African heads of state."
"President Sergio Matarella said he had agreed to all proposals but could not back Paolo Savona, a eurosceptic. Mr Matarella's move angered populist parties trying to form a coalition. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of 5-Star, called for the president's impeachment. Italy has been without a government since elections on 4 March. Two populist parties, 5-Star, which won 32% of the vote, and the far-right League party, which won 18%, had agreed earlier this month after days of talks to form a coalition. There is now a real argument in Italy between the president and the populists about this country's position in the EU, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Rome. As a stopgap move, the head of state has summoned former International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Carlo Cotarelli potentially to take over as a non-populist prime minister. But this appointment may not last and the only immediate solution may be an early election in which, all of a sudden, Italy's membership of the euro and its relationship with the EU itself really are up for discussion, our correspondent adds. What just happened? Mr Conte, a political novice, was proposed by the two parties as prime minister in an attempt to break Italy's 11-week political deadlock. He went to meet Mr Mattarella to put forward picks for his cabinet but the president vetoed Mr Savona as finance minister, citing his fierce opposition to the EU. Under Italian law, the president has the right to reject the appointment of a cabinet member but his decision was a controversial one. Mr Di Maio called for impeachment under article 90 of the constitution, which allows parliament to demand a president step down based on a simple majority vote. If a vote were to be successful, the country's constitutional court would then decide whether to impeach or not. ""After tonight, it's truly difficult to believe in the institutions and the laws of the state,"" Mr Di Maio said. What happens next? Mr Mattarella said he had ""agreed and accepted all the proposals except that of the economy minister"". ""No-one can claim that I have stood in the way of the formation of the so-called government for change,"" he said. He said he would wait before deciding whether to call fresh elections, and summoned Mr Cottarelli for talks on Monday. Mr Cottarelli, 64, worked at the IMF from 2008 to 2013, gaining the nickname ""Mr Scissors"" for making cuts to public spending in Italy. What else are the parties saying? Mr Di Maio said Mr Mattarella's rejection of Mr Savona was ""unacceptable"". ""It's an institutional clash without precedent,"" he said in a live Facebook video. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, called for a new election. ""In a democracy, if we are still in democracy, there's only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,"" he told supporters in a speech in central Italy. What do the markets make of the crisis? Mr Savona, who served as industry minister during the 1990s, has been an outspoken critic of the EU and an opponent of austerity programmes, prompting concern over the proposed government's commitment to the EU and ability to rein in the country's massive national debt - equal to 1.3 times its annual output. The League had proposed to cut personal and business taxes and roll back planned pension reforms designed to cut government spending, at a cost running into tens of billions of euros. President Mattarella warned on Sunday that the prospect of a populist government had ""alarmed Italian and foreign investors"" and worsened the ""spread"" - the gap between Italian and German 10-year government bond yields. The spread rose to 215 basis points on Friday - the widest in four years. Ratings agency Moody's warned that it might downgrade Italy's sovereign debt rating to ""Baa3"" - one notch above the junk rating.",Italian PM-designate Giuseppe Conte has given up his bid to form a government after the country's president vetoed his choice of economy minister.
"Since then, it has become what US officials have described as ""the most active operational franchise"" of al-Qaeda beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan. The group has vowed to target oil facilities, foreigners and security forces as it seeks to topple the Saudi and Yemeni governments, and establish an Islamic caliphate. It has claimed responsibility for a large number of attacks in the two countries, in which hundreds of people have been killed, as well as a series of sophisticated airline bomb plots targeting the US that were narrowly foiled. AQAP has also capitalised on the instability in Yemen in recent years to establish strongholds in the country's south and east, sometimes taking control of entire towns and villages. But the group has also suffered setbacks, mostly as a result of a US drone campaign that has seen more than 100 air strikes targeting its operatives in the past six years. In June 2015, AQAP announced that its leader Nasser al-Wuhayshi - who was believed to also have been al-Qaeda's overall second-in-command - had been killed in an air raid. While the group was quick to replace Wuhayshi with the experienced military and operations chief, Qasim al-Raymi, analysts said his death was a significant blow. Beheading Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden sought to launch a campaign in his homeland of Saudi Arabia with the intention of driving Americans out of the country and toppling the ""apostate"" monarchy. In May 2003, a local offshoot claimed responsibility for simultaneous suicide bombing attacks on three Western housing compounds in Riyadh, which left 29 people dead. Despite a subsequent crackdown on Islamist militants and radicals by the Saudi security forces, al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia was able to mount an attack on the Muhayyah residential compound in the capital that November, killing 17 people. In 2004, it suffered a major blow when its leader, Khaled Ali Hajj - a Yemeni and former bodyguard of Bin Laden - was ambushed and killed by Saudi troops. However, the group soon recovered under the guidance of a veteran Saudi militant, Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin, and launched a series of spectacular attacks. On 1 May 2004, militants shot dead five Western workers at a petrochemical complex in the north-western Red Sea city of Yanbu. On 29 May, more than 20 foreign and Saudi nationals were killed in attacks on three sites in the city of al-Khobar, increasing fears of political instability and pushing up global oil prices. The following month, members of AQAP abducted and beheaded a 49-year old American aerospace worker named Paul Johnson. The triumph was short-lived, however, as when security forces stormed a hideout in Riyadh looking for Johnson's murderers Muqrin was shot dead. Although militants killed at least nine people in a raid on the US consulate in Jeddah in December 2004, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula enjoyed notably less success under Muqrin's successor, Salih al-Awfi. The Saudi security services gradually gained the upper hand, and succeed in preventing any major attacks the following year, when Awfi was himself killed during a police raid in the holy city of Medina. In spite of the large numbers of Saudis who then travelled to militant training camps and gained experience fighting in places such as Iraq, the group found it increasingly difficult to organise operational cells inside the kingdom. Its last attempt a significant attack was at the Abqaiq oil facility in February 2006. Prison break Meanwhile in Yemen - the ancestral home of Bin Laden - militants took advantage of the weak central government, whose authority does not extend far outside the capital Sanaa, and established strongholds in its largely autonomous tribal regions. Although al-Qaeda cells were held responsible for several attacks inside Yemen since the suicide boat attack on the USS Cole near the port of Aden in 2000 that killed 17 US sailors, it was not until the second half of the decade that a fully-functioning affiliated group was formed. According to analyst Gregory Johnsen, between 2002 and 2003 the Yemeni government co-operated closely with the US to fight al-Qaeda. By the end of that period - which included one leader being killed in a controversial strike by a CIA drone aircraft - al-Qaeda appeared to be substantially weakened and so both countries shifted focus. The policy appeared to have worked until February 2006, Mr Johnsen says, when 23 suspected al-Qaeda members managed to escape from a prison in Sanaa, including Jamal al-Badawi, the alleged mastermind of the USS Cole bombing. Most were eventually either recaptured or killed, but two of the lesser-known escapees eluded the authorities, including Nasser Abdul Karim al-Wuhayshi, a former personal assistant to Bin Laden in Afghanistan, and Qasim al-Raymi. Born in 1976 in the Mukayras region of what is now the southern province of al-Bayda, Wuhayshi spent time in religious institutions in Yemen before travelling to Afghanistan in 1998 and joining al-Qaeda. He fought at the battle of Tora Bora in December 2001, before escaping over the border into Iran, where he was eventually arrested. He was extradited to Yemen in 2003. Raymi, born in Sanaa in 1978, was as a trainer at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the 1990s before returning to Yemen. In 2004, he was imprisoned for five years in connection with a plot to attack five foreign embassies in the capital. After escaping from prison, Wuhayshi and Raymi are said to have overseen the formation of al-Qaeda in Yemen, which took in both new recruits and experienced Arab fighters returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Protected by tribes who were wary of government interference, the group established bases from which to launch fresh attacks. The group claimed responsibility for two suicide bomb attacks that killed six Western tourists before being linked to the assault on the US embassy in Sanaa in September 2008, in which militants detonated bombs and fired rocket-propelled grenades. Ten Yemeni guards and four civilians were killed, along with six assailants. Four months later, Wuhayshi announced in a video the merger of the al-Qaeda offshoots in Yemen and Saudi Arabia to form ""al-Qaeda of Jihad Organisation in the Arabian Peninsula"". Analysts said the move was designed to bring Saudi al-Qaeda members who had fled their country and Yemeni militants together under one umbrella as a first step towards launching attacks throughout the region. Next to Wuhayshi and Raymi, the group's military commander, in the same video sat the new deputy leader, Said Ali al-Shihri, a Saudi national who was released from the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in November 2007. Another former detainee, Mohammed Atiq al-Harbi, also known as Mohammed al-Awfi, appeared alongside them and was described as a field commander. Embarrassingly for both Riyadh and Washington, both men had been released from Guantanamo into the custody of the Saudi government's ""deradicalisation"" programme for militants, which included art therapy. They both left the facility within weeks. The group's first operation outside Yemen was carried out in Saudi Arabia in August 2009 against the kingdom's security chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, though he survived. The bomber, Ahmed al-Asiri, concealed a device containing the high-explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) inside his body. His brother, Ibrahim, is believed to have made the bomb, as well as the device used in the failed attempt to destroy a Northwest Airlines Airbus A330 as it flew into Detroit on Christmas Day 2011. A Nigerian man sentenced to life in prison in connection with the incident, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, allegedly told investigators that AQAP operatives trained him in Yemen, equipped him with a powerful explosive device and told him what to do. After news of the latter incident emerged, AQAP released a statement saying it had sought to avenge raids by Yemeni forces aided by US intelligence, in which dozens of militants are reported to have died. Government offensive Following the bombing attempt, Yemeni government forces launched a major offensive against AQAP, targeting the organisation's senior leaders and training camps in the governorates of Shabwa, Abyan and Marib. They were supported heavily by the US, which sent advisers, provided intelligence, deployed unmanned drones and fired cruise missiles. Though officials claimed six leaders were killed, the offensive was considered largely unsuccessful. Instead of decapitating AQAP and disrupting its operations, the group shifted its strategy and stepped up its attacks inside Yemen. In February 2010, Raymi issued a statement threatening the US. ""Today, you have attacked us in the middle of our household, so wait for what will befall you in the middle of yours,"" he said. ""We will blow up the earth from beneath your feet"". Eight months later, the group was accused of sending bombs hidden in two packages addressed to synagogues in the US city of Chicago, which were found on planes in Dubai and the UK. Both were shipped from Yemen and used PETN, the explosive that was also used in the two earlier attacks on Prince Mohammed and the Northwest Airlines jet. One of the detonators was also almost exactly the same as the one used by Mr Abdulmutallab. US officials said Ibrahim al-Asiri had made them. Exploiting instability At home, AQAP capitalised on political turmoil in Yemen resulting from the uprising against longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011 to capture a string of southern towns and villages, only to be driven out of many areas in an army offensive in 2012 ordered by Mr Saleh's successor, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. At the same time, US President Barack Obama authorised a three-fold increase in the number of drone strikes targeting AQAP operatives in Yemen in 2012, resulting in the deaths of a number of senior figures, including Shihri, the deputy leader. The territorial losses did not, however, stop AQAP from launching major attacks Yemeni security forces and government personnel. They included a suicide bombing at a military parade in Sanaa in May 2012 that killed more than 120 people, and a raid on a hospital in the defence ministry compound in the capital in December 2013 that left 56 people dead. At the same time, Wuhayshi was reportedly named al-Qaeda's ""general manager"" by Bin Laden's successor as overall leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Intercepted communications between the two men led to an alert that saw several US embassies closed in the Middle East and Africa in August 2013. In March 2014, Wuhayshi was filmed telling a outdoor gathering of dozens of militants that al-Qaeda would fight Western ""Crusaders"" and their allies everywhere, pledging to ""remove the cross, the bearer of the cross, America"". That December, the group threatened to kill an American journalist it was holding hostage, Luke Somers, if its unspecified demands were not met within three days. As the deadline approached, Somers was killed along with another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, during a failed rescue attempt by US special forces. In January 2015, AQAP claimed to be behind a deadly attack on the Paris offices of the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, which had published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Officials confirmed that one of the gunmen had received training at an AQAP camp. AQAP also refused to pledge allegiance to the leader of the rival jihadist group, Islamic State, after it proclaimed the creation of caliphate in the territory under its control in Syria and Iraq, bucking the trend among other al-Qaeda affiliates. In Yemen, AQAP capitalised on the chaos caused by a rebellion by the Houthi movement and a Saudi-led air campaign to weaken the Zaidi Shia group, expanding the territory it controlled in the south and east of the country. However, the US drone strikes targeting AQAP did not stop and one was reported to have killed Wuhayshi as he met two fellow militants in Mukalla on 9 June. On 16 June, AQAP official Khaled Batarfi confirmed Wuhayshi's death in a video statement and vowed that ""the blood of these pioneers makes us more determined to sacrifice"". Batarfi also said Raymi had been elected by the group's leadership council to succeed Wuhayshi.",Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was formed in January 2009 by a merger between two regional offshoots of the international jihadist network in Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

"By Mark EdwardsBBC Isle of Man This is a guide to Tynwald and the 2016 general election: What is Tynwald and how does it work? Tynwald - believed to be world's longest continuous parliament - dates back 1,000 years and was established by the Vikings. It is made up of two chambers: the directly elected House of Keys (lower house) and the indirectly chosen Legislative Council (upper house). The Legislative Council has eleven members including the Bishop of Sodor and Mann and the Attorney General. The two chambers process legislation which requires Royal Assent but sit together as Tynwald to debate policy and financial issues. The Isle of Man was one of the first countries to give women the vote in 1881 and also led the way as the first country in western Europe to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote in national elections. MHKs work in the same way as MPs do at Westminster and can propose new laws and raise issues that matter to their constituents in the Manx parliament. They can also hold government ministers to account over current issues, scrutinise and vote on legislation and take part in debates when they gather in the chamber. Most candidates stand as independents, but there are registered political parties on the Isle of Man. Thirteen woman are seeking election this year compared to just seven in 2011 - only two were elected. Two candidates from each of the island's 12 constituencies will be elected as Members of the House of Keys (MHKs) for a term of five years. The Isle of Man is almost entirely self-governing, and the 24 successful representatives will control virtually every aspect of public life from law and order to health provision. MHKs in numbers In 2011, the Liberal Vannin party gained three seats with 21 MHKs electing to stand independently. There is also a Manx Labour Party, who through David Cretney, retained one seat in 2011. With no structured opposition, every issue is debated on its own merits and by consensus. There is no whip system in place - the council of ministers and government departments operate under a system of collective responsibility. At the last general election, Tim Crookall won the only seat in Peel with just 646 votes whilst Juan Watterson received the highest number of votes (3,080) - to gain one of Rushen's three seats. This year's election will see an end to a system in which some Manx residents get three votes and others get just one. Following an overhaul of the Isle of Man's electoral boundaries, each of 12 island areas will be represented by two political members with those elected sworn in on 27 September. A speaker will be elected on the same day. The government said the reform was needed to achieve ""equality in political representation"". A shake-up is guaranteed following announcements by six of those elected in 2011 that they will retire from politics in September. They include Chief Minister Allan Bell (Ramsey), Treasury minister Eddie Teare (Ayre), Environment, Food and Agriculture minister Richard Ronan (Castletown) and Policy and Reform minister John Shimmin (Douglas West). The founder of the Liberal Vannin party Peter Karran (Onchan) and his fellow Onchan representative Zac Hall will also stand down. There are three options:",Elections for the world's oldest continuous parliament in the Isle of Man take place on 22 September. More than 60 candidates will contest the 24 seats up for grabs in the House of Keys with residents as young as 16 eligible to vote.
"Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter@awzurcheron Twitter On Friday it was Michael Flynn's turn ""in the barrel"", to borrow a line from Trump confidant Roger Stone. The former national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about December 2016 conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak and pledged to ""fully co-operate"" with Mr Mueller's ongoing investigations. Mr Flynn has admitted he misled the FBI about his discussions regarding new sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration following evidence of alleged meddling in the 2016 election. There had been hints this was coming, after word last week that Mr Flynn's defence lawyers had stopped co-operating with the Trump legal team. The president's own scattershot behaviour on Twitter this week could also have been a key tell, like a trick knee acting up before a big storm. So why is this being billed as a major development in the ongoing investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia? Let us count the ways. 1) Trump's inner circle has been breached It is difficult to overstate the significance of this felony plea deal. Mr Flynn was a close adviser and confidant of Mr Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race. He was a surrogate for the candidate on television and enjoyed a prominent speaking role at the July Republican National Convention. He had a pivotal role in Mr Trump's presidential transition. The role of national security adviser in the White House, which Mr Flynn assumed upon Mr Trump's inauguration, is one of the most senior positions in any administration, responsible for being the key conduit between the sprawling US military and intelligence bureaucracies and the president. It is a post that has been held by the likes of Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Mr Trump was so partial to Mr Flynn that he was praising him as a ""wonderful man"" who had been ""treated very, very unfairly by the media"" just days after firing him. Now Mr Flynn could be going to jail - and, more importantly, could be sharing damaging information about the Trump inner circle he inhabited for so long. 2) Flynn is talking According to the ""Statement of the Offense"" filed by the special counsel's office, Mr Flynn is testifying that he had contact with Trump transition team officials before and after his fateful December 2016 conversation with Ambassador Kislyak. ""Members of the transition team,"" the document relates, ""did not want Russia to escalate the situation after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on the Russian government"". These conversations came more than a month after Mr Trump had won the presidency. Mr Flynn had already been announced as the national security adviser in the incoming White House - a top post in the president's inner circle. The next big question is who exactly were the unnamed senior members of the presidential transition team. Some US news outlets are naming Jared Kushner and former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland. Others seem to indicate it was Mr Trump himself. Eventually, Mr Flynn - and Mr Mueller - will have to lay their cards on the table. 3) Flynn is contradicting the White House line Mr Flynn's assertions about his conversations with the transition team run directly counter to statements made by Mr Trump in a February press conference in which he said Mr Flynn was acting against orders when he reached out to Mr Kislyak. In fact the White House said at the time that the president dismissed Mr Flynn as national security adviser because he lied to Vice-President Mike Pence about his Russian contacts. The true nature of Mr Flynn's conversations with Mr Kislyak first came out thanks to leaks to the press of information gleaned from government surveillance of Mr Kislyak. If Mr Flynn has evidence corroborating his account of December contacts with the Trump transition team - which was headed by Mr Pence himself - the White House's explanation for its handling of the Flynn situation, denials of knowledge and all, starts to crumble. Anyone in the president's inner circle who told the FBI or Mr Mueller's investigators that they weren't privy to Mr Flynn's activities, when there is evidence that they knew, would be open to another round of charges of lying to the FBI. The White House response, at least so far, seems to be that Mr Flynn is a lying liar who lies. ""The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,"" White House lawyer Ty Cobb wrote in a press statement. ""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn."" 4) Mr Mueller could be building an obstruction of justice case Dust off that old political saw that ""it's not the crime, it's the cover-up"". While Mr Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador is questionable, given that he was undercutting Obama administration policy efforts, it is probably not illegal. What is illegal, however, is obstruction of justice. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified that on 14 February - the day after Mr Flynn was sacked - Mr Trump urged the director to back off his investigation into Mr Flynn during a private Oval Office meeting. If the president knew that the ongoing law-enforcement inquiry would discover Mr Flynn had been acting under orders - either by the president or a member of his transition team - that could be the kind of motive that would help support an obstruction of justice charge. 5) Only the tip of the iceberg? There were a lot of rumours and allegations floating around about Mr Flynn before Friday's plea deal news. The special counsel's office was reportedly looking into Mr Flynn's Obama-era work as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was scrutinising his 2015 trip to Russia, paid for by the Kremlin-backed RT network, and his undisclosed lobbying on behalf of Turkish government interests. The charge brought against him, however, was solely related to his December 2016 phone conversations with Mr Kislyak. Although it comes with a possible five-year prison sentence, Mr Mueller hardly threw the book at the former national security adviser. Is this all there is? Mr Mueller is primarily tasked with investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mr Flynn was a senior adviser to and advocate for Mr Trump's presidential bid. Does the relative modesty of the charges against Mr Flynn indicate he may be offering information directly relevant to this inquiry? 6) The independent counsel investigation is wide-ranging Mr Flynn's plea deal is just one piece of a much larger puzzle the special counsel office is trying to solve. In October Mr Mueller indicted former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, a top aide with White House ties, on money laundering charges predating their involvement with the Trump campaign. He also struck a plea deal with former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who told prosecutors he lied about his own contacts with Russians. Each move is distinct and not directly related - at least not yet. A some point we are going to learn whether Mr Mueller is building a larger case against the Trump campaign out of these legal moves - or that the sum total of his efforts is nibbling around the edges. As the president likes to say, stay tuned.",Special Counsel Robert Mueller just dropped the hammer. Again.
"At least 10 more women were wounded, medical sources said. A Houthi rebel spokesman said the strike was followed by a second which hit emergency responders in Arhab, 40km (25 miles) from Sanaa. The rebels blamed a US and Saudi-backed coalition for the bloodshed, who are yet to comment. The coalition has been fighting the Houthis and forces loyal to a former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, since March 2015. Its aim is to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Abdel-Rahman al-Ahnomi, a spokesman for the Houthis, said the twin strikes killed and wounded dozens of people. However, other reports from the scene said there was only one air strike. Conflicting reports are common in the chaos following air raids in Yemen. Yemen's war has killed more than 10,000 civilians and displaced more than three million people since 2015. The conflict and a blockade imposed by the Saudi-led coalition have also triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 80% of the population in need of aid. Doctors Without Borders warned this week of a worsening situation in the city of Taiz, where hospitals have been repeatedly attacked and where 200,000 people face food, water and medicine shortages. The US was criticised last month over a raid on a village in central Yemen, in which a number of civilians died - many of them children. Its target was the house of a suspected leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). US media now report that the dead included a tribal leader allied to the internationally-backed president. A US Navy Seal was also killed in the attack, and six American soldiers were wounded.","Eight women and a child have reportedly been killed in an overnight air raid on a funeral reception near Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa."

Of the confirmed cases, about 75% are from the southern city of Daegu and 73% of those have been linked to the Shincheonji Church. In the capital, Seoul, the mayor urged the city's 10 million residents to work from home and to avoid crowded places. In other developments: Why is the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the spotlight? Members of the fringe Christian group are believed to have infected one another and then travelled around the country, apparently undetected. The group has been accused of keeping its members' names secret, making it harder to track the outbreak. But church spokesman Kim Shin-chang told the BBC they had provided a list of members, students, and buildings to authorities. ""We were worried about releasing this information because of the safety of our members,"" Mr Kim said. Mr Lee claims he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and identifies as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible who will take 144,000 people to heaven with him. The Shincheonji Church is labelled as a cult within South Korea and also in the Christian community, which results in the group often being discriminated against, persecuted or criticised, Mr Kim told the BBC. What's the global situation? Iran reported another 12 deaths on Monday, taking the total there to 66. They include Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a high-ranking adviser to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iranian media reported on Monday. Qatar, Ecuador, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Ireland were among countries that confirmed their first cases over the weekend. Ecuador on Monday reported five new cases of the disease, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to six. The US state of New York also confirmed its first case. The patient is a woman in her 30s who contracted the virus during a recent trip to Iran. Two people have died in the US, both in the state of Washington. What's the situation in China? China on Monday reported 42 more deaths, all in Hubei. The Chinese province was where the virus emerged late last year and it has registered more than 90% of the global fatalities. There were 202 confirmed new cases on Monday - only six of which were outside Hubei. A total of 2,912 people have died inside China, with more than 80,000 confirmed cases of the virus. A spokesman from China's National Health Commission said the next stop would be to ""focus on the risks brought by the resumption of work"". China's economy has taken a hit - with factory activity falling at a record rate. On Monday, a man was sentenced to death by a Chinese court for fatally stabbing two officials at a virus checkpoint, news agency AFP reported. Ma Jianguo, 23, refused to co-operate with officials - though it is not clear what he was told to do - and stabbed two checkpoint officials. What has the WHO said? On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus appeared to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. It urged countries to stock up on ventilators, saying ""oxygen therapy is a major treatment intervention for patients with severe Covid-19"". In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

"""In recent months we have seen people across the world take to the streets to protest,"" said Michelle Bachelet. Addressing the UN Human Rights Council, Ms Bachelet referred specifically to a recent wave of protests in Sudan, as well as protests in Haiti and France. She also warned of the ""existential threat"" of hate speech and xenophobia. Ms Bachelet expressed concern that the demands of citizens protesting against inequality were being met by ""violent and excessive use of force, arbitrary detentions, torture and even alleged summary or extrajudicial killings"". ""In Sudan, for the past several months, people protesting harsh economic conditions and bad governance have been violently dispersed by security forces, sometimes using live ammunition,"" she said. Ms Bachelet singled out Venezuela as an example of how ""violations of civil and political rights"" can accentuate inequality and worsening economic conditions. She also criticised Israel over its blockade of Gaza, and said she regretted Israel's ""immediate dismissal"" of a report by a UN Human Rights Council commission of inquiry, ""without addressing any of the very serious issues raised"". UN experts said last week that Israeli security forces might have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity while responding to weekly mass Palestinian protests along the Gaza-Israel border last year. The experts investigated the deaths of 189 Palestinians and said they found reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers had shot at children, medics and journalists, even though they had been clearly recognisable as such. ""All parties concerned should exercise restraint as the date of March 30 approaches,"" Ms Bachelet said, referring to the first anniversary of the start of the Palestinian protest campaign. The Israeli government said the report was ""hostile, mendacious and biased against Israel"". It has said its security forces have only opened fire in self-defence or on people trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the protests.","The UN human rights chief has warned of the threat posed by growing global inequality over income, wealth and access to resources and justice."
"By Phil MercerBBC, Cairns They are the victims of Roman Heinze, a 61-year old Australian, who was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison on Wednesday for kidnapping, assault and indecent assault. During his trial the women, both aged 24, told the court how they thought they would die during their ordeal at Salt Creek, south-east of Adelaide. The pair had met their attacker on an online classifieds site. Justice Trish Kelly said Heinze had cast Australia in the worst possible light. ""In committing these crimes you have undermined yet again the reputation of this country as a safe, friendly and attractive destination for young backpackers from all over the world,"" she said. The crimes of the Adelaide man are a shocking reminder of the dangers potentially facing foreign backpackers in Australia. Between 1989 and 1993, serial killer Ivan Milat murdered seven young travellers, including two British women, in the Belanglo State Forest south-west of Sydney. The man who led the investigation, Clive Small, a former police assistant commissioner in New South Wales, believes backpackers from overseas are an ""easy target"" for criminals. ""Backpackers are still looked at [by criminals] because they are isolated, they are not going to be missed within the next day or night because they didn't come home, and that gives the offender a greater chance of escape,"" Mr Small explained to the BBC from his home in Sydney. ""Because of their constant movement and travel they don't keep regular contact with family back at home. When they [relatives] don't hear from them for a while they just assume that they have been hitchhiking or changing location, and so it may well take some time before they start to become concerned."" Last August, two young Britons, Mia Ayliffe-Chung and Thomas Jackson, were stabbed to death at a hostel in Home Hill, south of Townsville. A Frenchman has been charged with their murders. Also in Queensland, a 22-year-old woman from Liverpool was rescued by police in March after being allegedly raped and held captive for weeks by a man she had befriended in the city of Cairns. The tropical city is a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, and is towards the northern tip of the well-worn backpacker trail that snakes along eastern Australia. Gap year appeal Cairns's warm autumn climate, glittering nightlife and jobs are a magnet for those seeking adventure from afar. ""I chose Australia because I thought it was one of the safest places and so far it hasn't proved me wrong,"" said Madison from the United States. ""There are always going to be a few weirdos. You've just got to steer clear. I've come across them in America, I've come across them here."" So has Tom, 18, from north Wales, who is travelling on a gap year with two mates. ""Yeah, there are a few oddballs over here. Just some strange people,"" he said. Becky Chalmers, a gap year student from Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, said her parents worried more than she did. ""If we think anything is dodgy, we just stay away from it. We just don't go anywhere near it,"" she said. Few of the young international travellers the BBC spoke with on the waterfront at Cairns knew much about the grisly side to Australia's backpacker history, such as the Milat murders, the killing of the Huddersfield tourist Peter Falconio at Barrow Creek in the Northern Territory in 2001, and an arson attack at a hostel in the farming town of Childers the year before that killed 15 people. ""When you hear of a young girl being kidnapped, or somebody else being raped or, on rare occasions, people being murdered as well, then obviously it damages Australia's reputation,"" explained Roger Maynard, a veteran Sydney-based journalist, who has written books on the Milat and Falconio murders. Visitor numbers strong The overwhelming consensus on the Esplanade in Cairns is that Australia is safer for travellers than most countries. According to Australian government statistics, the number of international visitors staying in backpacker accommodation grew by 8% to more than 645,000 in 2016. But there are other concerns, too. Exploitation of backpackers on farms has been well documented. Often those who are underpaid and overworked are, for example, picking fruit to satisfy employment criteria to extend their working holiday visas. ""There's plenty of scammers out there,"" said John Lynch, the manager of The Jack Hotel in Cairns. ""They play on the fact that some of these backpackers are quite desperate to stay for another year, so they are willing to perhaps work for a little bit less than they should. But it's about doing your research, doing your homework. Unfortunately being naive and believing everything you hear is the exact way you might get yourself into trouble."" The vast majority of travellers will head home with treasured memories and friendships that will never fade, but Australia should come with a precautionary health warning, according to Mr Maynard. ""The problem is a lot of young people who come here tend to think it is very much like back home and they get a false sense of security, and they tend to drop their guard,"" he said. ""They might party too much and they may not be quite as responsible as they might be back home. Be responsible, be aware of potential dangers but don't let it ruin your trip.""","A Brazilian backpacker is found naked and screaming for help on a remote beach in South Australia, while her friend from Germany is covered head-to-toe in blood."
"By Luisa BaldiniBBC royal correspondent In the early 1980s, according to Royal author Robert Lacey in ""A Brief Life of the Queen"", the monarch invited the editors of Fleet Street to discuss what might be done to alleviate the pressure the Princess of Wales was feeling at the hands of the media. On one occasion she had been photographed buying sweets in a village shop. ""If she wants to buy wine gums"", argued the editor of the News of the World, ""she should send a servant to get them"". To which the Queen responded: ""That is an extremely pompous remark."" A few years later the Privacy Act was introduced but it didn't stop the paparazzi hounding Princess Diana, especially abroad, and, ultimately, their pursuit of her contributed to her untimely death. Against this background, according to royal author Penny Junor, Prince William has become an expert at Privacy Law. He is especially protective of his wife. While she is hailed by some - including veteran Sun royal photographer Arthur Edwards - as ""the New Diana"", that must be exactly what the prince does not want. He does not want Kate to have to suffer the relentless camera intrusion his mother did. When she was still plain Kate Middleton he complained about the intrusion she was getting when she was simply trying to get to work. The couple did not take action against the Australian publication which printed photos of them on honeymoon. Now though, ""a red line has been crossed"" according to Palace officials. The gloves, it would seem, are off. The couple have not hidden their desire to start a family, a development which would mean media interest becoming more acute than ever. Maybe their hard line reaction to this affair is in anticipation of when that time comes.","The relationship between the Royals and the media has always been a delicate one. Ideally it is symbiotic. When it becomes parasitic, the Royals hit out."
"By Liza TambunanBBC News Indonesian Citra* thought it was just a work meeting. Two men, claiming to be local officials, said they wanted to go over budgets for a project she was running at a local aid agency. The then 28-year-old was slightly nervous about going alone but keen to distinguish herself at work, so she pushed such concerns aside. An hour in, the men suggested the meeting continue at a different location and invited her to ride in their car. Insisting on taking her own motorbike she went to slide her key into the ignition, when suddenly another group of men grabbed her. ""I was kicking and screaming, as they pushed me into the car. I was helpless. Inside two people held me down,"" she says. ""I knew what was happening."" She was being captured in order to be wed. Bride kidnapping, or kawin tangkap, is a controversial practice in Sumba with disputed origins which sees women taken by force by family members or friends of men who want to marry them. Despite long-standing calls for it to be banned by women's rights groups, it continues to be carried out in certain parts of Sumba, a remote Indonesian island east of Bali. But after two bride kidnappings were captured on video and widely shared on social media, the central government is now calling for it to end. 'It felt like I was dying' Inside the car, Citra managed to message her boyfriend and parents before arriving at a traditional house, with its high peaked roof and solid wooden pillars. The family who kidnapped her, she then realised, were distant relatives from her father's side. ""There were lots of people waiting there. They sounded a gong as I arrived and started doing rituals."" An ancient animist religion, known as Marapu, is widely practised in Sumba alongside Christianity and Islam. To keep the world in balance, spirits are appeased by ceremonies and sacrifices. ""In Sumba, people believe that when water touches your forehead you cannot leave the house,"" Citra said. ""I was very aware of what was happening, so when they tried to do that I turned at the last minute so that the water didn't touch my forehead."" Her captors told her repeatedly that they were acting out of love for her and tried to woo her into accepting the marriage. ""I cried until my throat was dry. I threw myself on the ground. I kept jabbing the motorbike key that I was holding into my stomach until it bruised. I hit my head against the large wooden pillars. I wanted them to understand I didn't want this. I hoped they would feel sorry for me."" For the next six days she was kept, effectively a prisoner in their house, sleeping in the living room. ""I cried all night, and I didn't sleep. It felt like I was dying."" Citra refused to eat or drink anything the family offered her believing it would put her under a spell: ""If we take their food, we would say yes to the marriage."" Her sister smuggled food and water to her while her family, with the support of women's rights groups, negotiated her release with village elders and the family of the potential groom. No position to negotiate Women's rights group Peruati has documented seven such bride kidnappings in the last four years, and believe many more have taken place in remote areas of the island. Just three women, including Citra, ended up being freed. In the two most recent cases that were captured on video in June, one woman stayed in the marriage. ""They stayed because they didn't have a choice,"" says activist Aprissa Taranau, the local head of Peruati. ""Kawin tangkap can sometimes be a form of arranged marriage and women are not in a position to negotiate."" She says those that do manage to leave are often stigmatised by their community. ""They're labelled as a disgrace and people say they will not be able to get married now or have children. So women stay because of a fear of that,"" she says. That is what Citra was told. ""Thank God I am now married to my boyfriend and we have a one-year old child,"" she says with a smile, three years on from her ordeal. Promises to outlaw the practice Local historian and elder Frans Wora Hebi argues the practice is not part of Sumba's rich cultural traditions and says it is used by people wanting to force women to marry them without consequences. A lack of firm action by custodial leaders and the authorities means the practice continues, he says. ""There are no laws against it, only sometimes there is social reprimand against those who practice it but there is no legal or cultural deterrent."" Following a national outcry, regional leaders in Sumba signed a joint declaration rejecting the practice early this month. Women's Empowerment Minister Bintang Puspayoga flew to the island from the capital, Jakarta, to attend. Speaking to the media after the event she said: ""We have heard from custodial leaders and religious leaders, that the practice of capture and wed that went viral is not truly part of Sumba's traditions."" She promised that the declaration was the beginning of a wider government effort to end the practice that she described as violence against women. Rights groups have welcomed the move but described it as ""a first step in a long journey"". Citra says she is grateful that the government is now paying attention to the practice and hopes, as a result, no one will have to go through what she did. ""For some this may be a tradition from our ancestors. But it's an out of date custom that must stop because it's very damaging to women."" *Citra's name has been changed to protect her identity.

"In a statement, actress Laura Smet said she was ""stupefied and hurt"" after learning she had been left nothing from her father's estate. His biological son David is also contesting, the AFP news agency says. The singer, who was hugely popular in his native France, died in December aged 74 from lung cancer. Ms Smet, 34, said she was shocked to be left without even a souvenir in her father's will, ""not even the sleeve of the song Laura"", which was dedicated to her. In a letter addressed to her father and published in French media, she complained she had not ""been able to say goodbye"". ""I would have preferred all this to stay with the family, unfortunately, in our family it's like this,"" she wrote. Her lawyers maintain the will, drafted in California, contravenes French laws that prevent children being disinherited. The rocker married Laeticia in 1996. They then adopted two Vietnamese-born daughters, Jade and Joy. According to the statement, the will stipulates that in the event of Laeticia dying, then the estate goes to the adopted children only. Hallyday, whose real name was Jean-Philippe Smet, was often referred to as ""the French Elvis"". The singer sold about 100 million records and starred in a number of films, but failed to crack the English-speaking market. Hundreds of thousands of people came out to pay tribute to him after he died from lung cancer aged 74 in December.",The children of French rock star Johnny Hallyday are contesting his will after he left everything to his fourth wife Laeticia and their adopted daughters.
"By Aleem Maqbool BBC News, Islamabad It has exposed the deep fissure that runs through society here, and some signs of the direction in which this country appears to be heading. There are still questions as to whether Mumtaz Qadri, the assassin and one of the governor's own bodyguards, acted alone, or with the backing of a radical movement. But his motive appears clear - he was angered by Salman Taseer's stance against Pakistan's stringent blasphemy laws. The governor felt they discriminated against Pakistan's religious minorities and was the most prominent supporter of a Christian woman in Punjab who was sentenced to death for insulting the Prophet Muhammad, something she denied doing. 'Feted celebrity' That made him something of a hate figure among some radical, fundamentalist quarters. For some of them Qadri, the man accused of killing him, has become a feted celebrity. In the city of Peshawar, a demonstration has been held to celebrate Salman Taseer's murder and there were chants calling for Mumtaz Qadri's release. ""We, all the students, are proud of the job which Mumtaz performed,"" said one demonstrator. ""We all are with him."" ""The governor said the blasphemy law was a black law, that's why Mumtaz killed him,"" says another. ""He did a tremendous job."" This is one - admittedly extreme - guise of Pakistan though it has shown itself elsewhere since Mr Taseer's death - on social networking sites, and radio phone-in programmes. But there are also many Pakistanis who have been profoundly affected by what has happened, and are mourning the loss of a liberal hero. This evening, at the spot where Mr Taseer was killed in Islamabad, was an altogether different gathering of people from the one in Peshawar, of people with a very different outlook. For them, Qadri's alleged act was an attempt to rob them of their liberty too. 'Eye-opener' ""It is a very, very shocking incident,"" said one man at the candlelit vigil in Kohsar Market. ""I would say it's an eye-opener for the mainstream political parties. They should close ranks and deny religious parties the space they have which fuels a lot of radical people like the person who killed Salman Taseer."" ""We are small in numbers when we speak against all this extremism that's going on,"" one lady tells us. ""There are many people who will not come out because they're afraid. My children want to go abroad rather than be suppressed in this manner."" The governor's brutal death could spark debate as to what type of society Pakistanis want for themselves - one which is moderate and progressive, or one which is conservative and hard-line. But it could also simply have the effect of silencing those, like Mr Taseer, who want to stand up for those they feel are being unfairly persecuted. In November, when I last met Salman Taseer, he repeatedly voiced his belief that Pakistanis were an inherently liberal, humane people. He insisted they would ultimately reject extremism. He pointed out that, in elections, religious parties have never done particularly well in Pakistan. But the manner of Mr Taseer's passing is an indication to many that the radical elements within this society, however small or large they may be in number, are the ones currently forcing the agenda.","Punjab Governor Salman Taseer was one of Pakistan's best-known political figures, but his death has revealed much more about this country than just its politics."
"The incident occurred on Monday evening outside a hospital in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province. CCTV footage showed an explosion inside the sinkhole shortly after the bus and bystanders fell inside on Monday evening. Several deadly sinkholes have been reported in China in recent years. The footage from the latest incident shows the moment people waiting at a bus stop are forced to flee as the ground underneath the bus starts to cave in. A number of people gather to try to rescue the bus passengers, but are engulfed by the sinkhole as it suddenly widens. According to state media, the sinkhole stretched nearly 10m (32 feet) in diameter. It is unclear how many people were inside the bus at the time of the incident. Sinkholes in China are often blamed on construction works and the rapid pace of development in the country. In 2018, four people were killed after a sinkhole opened up on a busy pavement in the city of Dazhou, south-west China. In 2013, a similar incident killed five people at an industrial estate in the southern city of Shenzhen.",At least six people have been killed and 16 injured after an enormous sinkhole swallowed a bus and a number of pedestrians in central China.
"Ibama approved the clearing of forest at the planned site for the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant. Licences still have to be granted for the actual building of the plant. Contracts for the dam, which would be the world's third biggest, were finally signed last August after years of protests. On Wednesday, Ibama gave approval for 238 hectares (588 acres) of land to be cleared. However, further legal challenges are likely, correspondents say. Last month, the head of Ibama, Abelardo Bayma, resigned, citing personal reasons. Brazilian media reported that he had come under pressure to facilitate the granting of licences for the Belo Monte construction. The government says the Belo Monte dam is crucial for development and will create jobs. Environmental groups say the 6km-long (3.7 miles) dam will threaten the survival of indigenous groups and could make some 50,000 people homeless, as 500 sq km (190 sq miles) of land would be flooded. Bidding for the project had to be halted three times before a final court appeal by the government allowed Norte Energia, led by the state-owned Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco, to be awarded the contract last year. The proposal to build a hydro-electric dam on the Xingu River in the northern state of Para has long been a source of controversy. The initial project was abandoned in the 1990s amid widespread protests both in Brazil and around the world. The 11,000-megawatt dam would be the biggest in the world after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay. It is expected to cost between $11bn and $17bn, and provide electricity to 23 million homes.","Brazil's environment agency, Ibama, has given the go-ahead for initial work to begin on a huge hydroelectric dam on a tributary of the Amazon River."
"The 25-strong lifeboat crew walked out in protest three weeks ago after coxswain Andy Hibbs was dismissed. The Jersey Action Group (JAG) said it was supporting the St Helier crew and had launched a campaign to persuade people not to donate to the RNLI. The RNLI said it was ""disappointed"" by the move. More on this story and others from Jersey The Fresh Fish Company said it had put away RNLI collection tins until Mr Hibbs was reinstated. An RNLI spokesman said the campaigners' action was ""misdirected"" because any fall in donations would also affect St Catherine's Lifeboat in Jersey as well as beach lifeguards. It said: ""We are of course disappointed to hear about any members of the public who feel they would like to withdraw their much appreciated support."" Jersey currently receives lifeboat cover from the other Channel Islands stations - St Catherine's, St Peter Port and Alderney. The RNLI said its decision to remove Mr Hibbs was made due to a ""serious risk to its ability to run a safe and effective lifesaving service"". Mr Hibbs denies the RNLI's claim he broke the volunteers' code of conduct and has appealed against his dismissal. John Baker, vice chair of JAG campaigners said the group was not forcing people to boycott the RNLI but it wanted Mr Hibbs to be reinstated.","Campaigners have urged people ""not to donate"" to the RNLI at the Jersey Boat Show this weekend in a dispute over the sacking of the lifeboat's coxswain."

"Lord Colin Moynihan said Ye, 16, had passed drug tests, was ""clean"" and deserved recognition for her talent. Ye smashed her personal best by at least five seconds in the 400m Medley. Senior US coach John Leonard said her performance was disturbing and hinted that doping could have been involved. Mr Leonard, executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, said the performance reminded him of the East German women swimmers in the 1980s, who were doping on a systematic basis. ""History in our sport will tell you that every time we see something, and I will put quotation marks around this, unbelievable, history shows us that it turns out later on there was doping involved,"" he told the UK's Guardian newspaper. But Ye, who will compete later in the 200m Medley final, has strongly defended herself and denied that she would ever use banned substances. China's anti-doping chief has said Chinese athletes have undergone nearly 100 drugs tests since arriving in London, and that not a single Chinese athlete had tested positive. Former swimmers, other Olympic champions and experts have all given their support to Ye. Lord Moynihan told a news conference that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was ""on top of the game"". ""She's been through Wada's programme and she's clean. That's the end of the story. Ye Shiwen deserves recognition for her talent,"" he said. International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials also insisted that if there were any drugs cheats, they would be caught . Dick Pound, an IOC member and former president of Wada, told the BBC that Ye's performance was ""surprising"". ""Nobody's ever seen somebody swim that fast before. You expect that to be an occurrence at an Olympic Games,"" he said. ""The problem is - with all the suspicions about drug use throughout sport - when something is really, really spectacular, the first thing you do after you see that performance is say, 'hmm, I wonder'."" Mr Pound added: ""It's a fact of life that people say, 'wasn't that magnificent, was it too magnificent?'"" Earlier scandals The US Olympic Committee (USOC) has distanced itself from Mr Leonard's comments - its spokesman, Patrick Sandusky, told the BBC the Americans were trying to smooth things over with the Chinese. A member of USOC's international relations team is expected to make contact with the Chinese Olympic Committee later on Tuesday, says the BBC's David Bond. ""We are reaching out to the Chinese and their Olympic committee to ensure they know that this gentleman [Mr Leonard] is not part of our delegation, USA Swimming or the US Olympic Committee,"" the USOC member said. ""His comments are an independent view and not from us."" Earlier, former British Olympic champion Adrian Moorhouse said the rumours appeared to be a case of sour grapes. ""The Chinese might have just found this really talented kid, who can work really hard, has the perfect shape and can cope with all the pressure thrown at her,"" he told the BBC. Suspicions over Ye's performance were heightened when it was pointed out that in the final 50m of her race she swam faster than the winner of the men's race, Ryan Lochte. However, her world-record time was still 23 seconds slower than Lochte's winning time, and several of Lochte's competitors were faster than her over the final 50m. Chinese officials also pointed out that Lochte was easing to the finish, comfortably in the lead, whereas Ye had to battle to the end to take first place. China's swimming team was repeatedly hit by doping scandals in the 1990s. Seven swimmers tested positive for drugs in the 1994 Asian Games, and four years later four Chinese swimmers failed pre-tournament drug tests before the World Championships in Australia. Chinese officials insist they have cleaned up the sport, but earlier this year another 16-year-old swimming prodigy, Li Zhesi, failed a drug test. All medal winners at the Olympics are drug tested. In addition, any athlete whose performance is far better than anything they have achieved before can be targeted for extra tests.","Teenage Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen is not a drug cheat, the British Olympic Association's chairman has said, after a US coach cast doubt on her world record-breaking swim."
"Dozens of people stood outside the Casablanca court demanding the prisoners' immediate release ahead of the ruling. The authorities have accused the activists of being separatists. Protests rocked the North African country in 2016 and 2017 after the death of a local fishmonger. Mohcine Fikri was crushed to death by a rubbish lorry in the city of Al-Hoceima as he tried to protect his fish, which had been confiscated by the police. His death in October 2016 prompted a wave of anger, with thousands taking to the streets accusing authorities of abuse of power and corruption. The so-called Hirak movement spread throughout the northern Rif region, and about 400 people were detained - drawing further demonstrations. In June 2018, courts sentenced the leader of the movement, Nasser Zefzaki, to 20 years in prison, with the same term for activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid.

I've appointed two in three years,"" Trump said in a March interview with Mr Woodward, best known for his reporting on the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. On Sunday, CNN and the Washington Post released audio clips of interviews that were not featured in Mr Woodward's new book about Mr Trump's presidency, Rage. The audio revealed remarks by Mr Trump that have gained new significance following the death of long-standing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at 87 on Friday. Her death has triggered an explosive political row over the nomination of her successor on the court, which often has the final say on some of the country's most divisive legal matters. The balance between judges seen as conservative or liberal on the nine-member court is crucial to its rulings. Currently, conservative justices outnumber liberals ones five to three. President Trump has said he will next week nominate a woman to replace Ginsburg, a liberal justice and feminist icon who served for 27 years on the court. But Democrats, including Mr Trump's challenger in this November's presidential election, Joe Biden, have urged Republicans to delay a vote in the Senate, which confirms the nomination. They argue that the nominee should be decided by whoever wins the election. Republicans disagree, arguing President Trump has the right to nominate a candidate. What did Trump say about judges? Mr Trump told Mr Woodward in December last year that he and Mr McConnell had ""broken every record"" on judicial appointments. Mr Trump has nominated 216 federal judges during his first term - a high number by historical standards - but, according to CNN, former presidents have appointed a higher percentage of the overall number of federal judges. Mr McConnell has pushed the Senate to approve Mr Trump's nominations, tilting the US judiciary in a conservative direction. ""You know what Mitch's biggest thing is in the whole world? His judges,"" Mr Trump told Woodward in the interview. ""He will absolutely ask me, please let's get the judge approved instead of 10 ambassadors."" Should the vote to nominate a new Supreme Court justice go ahead before November's election, Mr McConnell could have a decisive role. Speaking to Mr Woodward in May, Mr Trump talked about the judicial vacancies he inherited from President Barack Obama, describing them as ""golden nuggets"". Given Mr Trump's record on appointing judges, Mr Woodward joked that ""maybe they'll put a statue of you outside the Supreme Court"". ""Oh, what a good idea,"" Trump said, appearing to take the suggestion seriously. ""I think I'll have it erected tomorrow. What a great idea. I'll think I'll use it."" In January, Mr Woodward asked Mr Trump if he shared the concerns of Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who said the judiciary was becoming too partisan. ""Well, it depends,"" Mr Trump told Mr Woodward. ""Yeah, it's very partisan right now, basically. It's always a party vote. I mean, look, the whole country right now is a partisan vote."" Mr Woodward's book was published on 15 September. In it, he gave a damning assessment of Mr Trump's presidency, concluding he was ""the wrong man for the job"". The journalist quoted Mr Trump as saying he knew Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu before the disease hit the US, but wanted to play down the crisis. The president - who is running for re-election in November - said Mr Woodward's book was ""a political hit job"".

"Avijit Roy Avijit Roy was born to a Hindu family in 1972 in Bangladesh but had emigrated to the US. An engineer by profession, he set up his Bengali-language blog, Mukto-Mona (Free Mind) to promote secular and humanist writing in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. He was also the author of numerous books and magazine and journal articles - and had received death threats from Islamist radicals for his writings, according to his family. He courted controversy by not only championing atheism but also tacking issues such as homosexuality which he argued was inherent in man's nature. His approach upset many in conservative Bangladesh. He regularly returned to Bangladesh for the country's annual book fair in Dhaka, which is where he was killed in February. ""He was a wonderful man who through his website encouraged many free-thinking Bangladeshis to challenge conventional religious orthodoxy,"" one friend told the BBC. Obituary: US-Bangladesh writer Avijit Roy Avijit Roy killing: Locals react Widow of blogger Avijit Roy defiant Ananta Bijoy Das Ananta Bijoy Das, 32, was a banker who wrote blogs for Mukto-Mona, the website once moderated by Avijit Roy. Police said that, according to writings by Das that they had collected, he also wrote about science and the evolution of the Soviet Union. A group of machete-wielding attackers hacked him to death in the north-eastern city of Sylhet in May. A fellow blogger is reported as saying that while Das championed secularism he was mostly concerned with science, and had written a book about Charles Darwin. ""He was a voice of social resistance,"" said Imran Sarker, head of the Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh. Bangladesh blogger Ananta Bijoy Das hacked to death Washiqur Rahman Washiqur Rahman, 27, blogged under the pen-name, Kucchit Hasher Channa, or Ugly Duckling. He is reported to have criticised irrational religious beliefs and is said to have written a 52-episode series for an anti-religion satirical site called Dhormockery.com which mocked aspects of Islam. According to the International Humanist and Ethical Union, he was mild mannered in person but wrote biting satire before he was killed in Dhaka in March. Rahman wrote about religion and science mainly on Facebook, according to news website BDNews24. ""I liked him for his satire, his sense of humour. He was a wonderful blogger,"" said Asif Mohiuddin, a fellow Bangladeshi blogger.

"By Andrew ClaranceBBC News, Delhi The app - Aarogya Setu, which means ""bridge to health"" in Sanskrit - was launched just six weeks ago. India has made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to download it. But users and experts in India and around the world say the app raises huge data security concerns. How does it work? Using a phone's Bluetooth and location data, Aarogya Setu lets users know if they have been near a person with Covid-19 by scanning a database of known cases of infection. The data is then shared with the government. ""If you've met someone in the last two weeks who has tested positive, the app calculates your risk of infection based on how recent it was and proximity, and recommends measures,"" Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov at India's IT ministry which built the app, told the BBC. While your name and number won't be made public, the app does collect this information, as well as your gender, travel history and whether you're a smoker. Is it mandatory to download the app? Prime Minster Narendra Modi has tweeted in support of the app, urging everyone to download it, and it's been made mandatory for citizens living in containment zones and for all government and private sector employees. Noida, a suburb of the capital, Delhi, has made it compulsory for all residents to have the app, saying they can be jailed for six months for not complying. Food delivery start-ups such as Zomato and Swiggy have also made it mandatory for all staff. But the government directive is being questioned by some. In an interview with The Indian Express newspaper, former Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna said the drive to make people use the app was ""utterly illegal"". ""Under what law do you mandate it? So far it is not backed by any law,"" he told the newspaper. MIT Technology Review's Covid Tracing Tracker lists 25 contact tracing apps from countries around the globe - and there are concerns about some of them too. Critics say apps such as China's Health Code system, which records a user's spending history in order to deter them from breaking quarantine, is invasive. ""Forcing people to install an app doesn't make a success story. It just means that repression works,"" says French ethical hacker Robert Baptiste, who goes by the name Elliot Alderson. What are the main concerns about India's app? Aarogya Setu stores location data and requires constant access to the phone's Bluetooth which, experts say, makes it invasive from a security and privacy viewpoint. In Singapore, for example, the TraceTogether app can be used only by its health ministry to access data. It assures citizens that the data is to be used strictly for disease control and will not be shared with law enforcement agencies for enforcing lockdowns and quarantine. ""Aarogya Setu retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure compliance of legal orders and so on,"" says the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights and liberties advocacy group in Delhi. The app builders, however, insist that at no point does it reveal a user's identity. ""Your data is not going to be used for any other purpose. No third party has access to it,"" Mr Singh of MyGov said. The big issue with the app is that it tracks location, which globally has been deemed unnecessary, says Nikhil Pahwa, editor of internet watchdog Medianama. ""Any app that tracks who you have been in contact with and your location at all times is a clear violation of privacy."" He is also worried by the Bluetooth function on the app. ""If I'm on the third floor and you are on the fourth floor, it will show that we have met, even though we are on different floors, given that Bluetooth travels through walls. This shows 'false positives' or incorrect data."" What are the concerns over privacy? The app allows the authorities to upload the collected information to a government-owned and operated ""server"", which will ""provide data to persons carrying out medical and administrative interventions necessary in relation to Covid-19"". The Software Freedom Law Centre, a consortium of lawyers, technology experts and students, says it is problematic as it means the government can share the data with ""practically anyone it wants"". MyGov says ""the app has been built with privacy as a core principle"" and the processing of contact tracing and risk assessment is done in an ""anonymised manner"". Mr Singh says when you register, the app assigns you a unique ""anonymised"" device ID. All interactions with the government server from your device are done through this ID only and no personal information is exchanged after registration. But experts have raised doubts about the government claim. Mr Alderson has said there are flaws in the app which make it possible to know who is sick anywhere in India. ""Basically, I was able to see if someone was sick at the PMO [prime minister's office] or the Indian parliament. I was able to see if someone was sick in a specific house if I wanted,"" he wrote on his blog. Aarogya Setu denied any such privacy breach in a statement. But, India has ""a terrible history"" of protecting privacy, says Mr Pahwa, referring to Aadhaar - the world's largest and most controversial biometrics-based identity database. Critics have repeatedly warned that the scheme puts personal information at risk and have criticised government efforts to compulsorily link it to bank accounts and mobile phone numbers. ""This government has argued that privacy isn't a fundamental right in court,"" Mr Pahwa said. ""We cannot trust it."" India's Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that the controversial Aadhaar scheme was constitutional and did not violate the right to privacy. And the question of transparency? Unlike the UK's Covid-19 tracing app, Aarogya Setu is not open source, which means that it cannot be audited for security flaws by independent coders and researchers. A senior IT ministry official told a newspaper that the government had not made the source code of Aarogya Setu public because it ""feared that many will point to flaws in it and overburden the staff overseeing the app's development"". Mr Singh said ""all applications are made open source ultimately and the same is applicable to Aarogya Setu also"". Can you beat the system? To register, users have to give their name, gender, travel history, telephone number and location. ""People can fill the form incorrectly and the government cannot verify it, so the efficacy of the data is questionable,"" Mr Pahwa told the BBC. According to a Buzzfeed report, an Indian software engineer had hacked the app to bypass the registration page, and even stopped the app from gathering data through GPS and Bluetooth. The report also mentioned a comment on Reddit suggesting phone wallpaper as a simple workaround to not downloading the app. ""The privacy conscious are likely to do this. Those who don't want to be forced to give their data to the government will look for and find workarounds. It could be by using a modified app or a screenshot, people will find ways,"" Mr Pahwa says. But Mr Singh argues that ""if one is staying home and not meeting anyone, it would not matter whether they have the app, or deleted it or switched the Bluetooth off or lied on self-assessment"".","India's Covid-19 contact tracing app has been downloaded 100 million times, according to the information technology ministry, despite fears over privacy."
"The police headquarters and the main government building fell to the Taliban on Wednesday, a local senator said. The Taliban say their fighters have seized the entire district. However, the Afghan defence ministry said fighting was continuing and that reinforcements had been sent. Sangin saw almost a quarter of British military fatalities during the UK's combat mission in Afghanistan. District governor Haji Suliman Shah told the BBC he had been airlifted from the district HQ to Shorabak base - formerly Camp Bastion - in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah early on Wednesday, along with 15 wounded security force members. A few hundred police and soldiers have taken refuge at an army barracks about 7km (four miles) from Sangin, and are besieged there. Why Sangin matters Read more about Sangin Harsh lessons from Sangin Who are the Taliban? Ashuqullah, a police officer at the barracks, told the BBC the ""entire"" town was controlled by militants. ""We have not seen any help,"" he said. ""Support troops have been airdropped at a distance... but all roads are blocked and in the militants' control,"" he added. There were many wounded at the barracks needing urgent evacuation, he said. Speaking in Kabul, Afghanistan's acting Defence Minister Masoum Stanikzai described the situation in Helmand as ""manageable"" and said fresh support troops had been sent in. Afghan government forces had been ""thinly spread"" over the whole country, he said, and had been trying their best to hold all areas. A small contingent of British troops has been sent to Helmand ""in an advisory role,"" the British government said on Tuesday. A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, claimed on Wednesday: ""The Sangin district centres, its police HQ, and other establishments were under continued attacks of the mujahideen and today... with God's grace the district was fully captured by the mujahideen. ""The white flag of the Islamic emirate is at full mast at the district now.'' Haji Daud, the head of the Sangin district people's council, told the BBC that Sangin residents had fled the district to neighbouring areas. Responding to the defence minister's claims, he said: ""Those whose family - brothers and siblings and parents - are not fighting on the front, they always say the situation is not dangerous in the area..."" ""Those who make such comments do not care to defend Helmand."" Pharmacy owner Sarwah Shah, who fled to Lashkar Gah, told the BBC that all of the families living on his street in Sangin - around 20 to 30 houses - had fled. Another resident Agha Wali said he had fled Sangin with his children two days ago. He had had to leave all his possessions behind, he said. The Taliban have already seized control of all but two districts in Helmand. On Monday the deputy governor of Helmand complained of a lack of government support in an open letter on Facebook to President Ashraf Ghani. ""Helmand will collapse to the enemies and it's not like Kunduz, where we could launch an operation from the airport to retake it. That is just impossible and a dream,"" he wrote. In September, the Taliban briefly overran the northern Afghan city of Kunduz in one of their biggest victories since 2001.",Latest reports from southern Afghanistan suggest that Sangin district in Helmand province is now almost entirely under Taliban control after days of fierce fighting.
"Valentina Romano, from Como, Italy, found the postcard on the pavement and was instantly struck by the postmark. Stamped with the Nazi eagle, the card was signed by Roberto Bianchi and sent from Breslau, now Wroclaw in Poland. The young writer seems to have sent it to reassure his loved ones. ""My dear parents,"" he writes, ""after a long silence, this is me letting you know that I'm now at another site where I work on the land. I'm in the open countryside, in a farmhouse. I've got plenty to eat, so don't worry at all - I'm very well."" Sending love to his parents and grandparents, the soldier concludes: ""I'm always close to you in thought. There's nothing left for me to do except send you a kiss, dear mum and dad. I trust that I will soon return to you."" Ms Romano, 42, who teaches Italian and Latin, said the card gave her ""an emotion as strong as it was unexpected"". Determined to find the mystery writer's family, she posted on Facebook asking for help tracking them down. A journalist friend working for local TV station Espansione suggested Ms Romano should make a TV appeal, and a few days later the writer's family got in touch. Delighted, the teacher delivered the card to Roberto's 74-year-old cousin, Roman Bianchi. She told the BBC: ""When I handed over the postcard, they were so grateful, happy and emotional. I was happy to be told that Roberto had managed to get home and lived a long life. ""I love 'old paper', having carried out research in medieval history and studied paleography [old handwriting] for a long time. I realised very soon that I had in my possession more than a simple piece of paper - I had a piece of history."" Roberto Bianchi was born in 1924, and taken prisoner by the Nazis as a 20-year-old soldier. He survived the war and returned to the small town of Faggeto Lario, where he married and stayed for the rest of his life. He died in 1999. ""We did not know of the existence of this postcard. Reading the words of our cousin has awakened old memories - it was a great thrill for all of my family"", Roman Bianchi told the Italian Huffington Post. He said the card had been kept in his cousin's old house, and that the current occupant ""had emptied [out] everything: furniture, cabinets, books and old papers"". The relic would have been pulp by now, had it not blown away and settled in Ms Romano's path. In a final stroke of coincidence, Roberto Bianchi was also a postman. ""Everyone knew him as Robertino the country postman,"" his cousin said. ""He was very generous and helpful. A boy who - like many at the time - did not have the facilities to study, but could conquer everyone with his smile and an accordion"". The younger Mr Bianchi said his cousin was very proud of his work, and honoured to be the keeper of the locals' letters. Ms Romano told the BBC she hoped the 74-year-old would visit the school where she teaches, ""to tell my pupils about that part of history that no-one should ever forget"".

"By Tom GerkenBBC News, Washington It's called ""pinched fingers"" and depending on where you are in the world, a new emoji announced by the Unicode Consortium, which approves standard emojis worldwide, could have a completely different meaning. Its official purpose, according to the emoji's creators, is to represent the way an Italian might ask ""what do you want?"". But that has not stopped its differing interpretations worldwide since the icon was debuted in January 2020. In a 14-page proposal for the emoji, creators of the ""pinched fingers"" icon suggested that the gesture would be representative of Italian culture because ""everybody knows Italians speak with their hands"" - but may have other meanings elsewhere. ""We expect this emoji to be widely used not only in Italy and other Mediterranean countries,"" it says, ""but also, more broadly, worldwide because of the increasing popularity of Italian culture and way of life. ""You will find people using this particular configuration of the fingers in most cultures, it is simply a universal form of signing."" For example, according to journalist Kim Zetter, the gesture can have a myriad of meanings in Israel. In Nigeria, it was suggested the gesture could be the emoji version of ""gbas gbos"" - a back-and-forth argument - and in India it can be a way of asking if somebody is hungry. In the Arab world it could be a gesture a mother would use toward her child. There are of course various comedy interpretations which have emerged, such as one person's claim it represents eating without utensils, or another's suggestion that with a simple flip it could mean ""a pinch of salt"". There are also a legion of people who will see the emoji and instantly think of K-Pop star Yuri, who is known for making a gesture with her hand in the shape of a dumpling. It is often associated with the phrase ""I mandu you"" - with mandu being the Korean word for dumpling - because fans joke about the pose being her way of saying ""I love you"" to them. To have an emoji created, a person must make a detailed application for it to be included in Unicode, the system which makes text and emoji function on electronic devices. This is how the same emoji can appear across different devices, regardless of whether it is an Apple or Google product. The most recent batch of emojis to be released in 2020 also includes gender-neutral wedding symbols and the trans flag. A pickup truck emoji approved by Unicode is thought to have been inspired by Ford, the US carmaker, which petitioned Unicode for the icon. In total, 117 options will be added in 2020 as part of the ""Emoji 13.0"" update.","Is it a way to show disbelief, a way to ask others to be quiet, or a cute gesture popularised by a K-Pop star?"
"The vote was passed by the House of Representatives and received similar approval by the Senate earlier this week. The bill is now likely to be signed into law by President Barack Obama. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro described the move as imposing ""insolent imperialist sanctions"". He said the US wanted to ""challenge Venezuela with sanctions and threats"". Mr Maduro warned the US leader: ""If the crazy path of sanctions is imposed, President Obama, I think you're going to come out looking very bad. ""Who is the US Senate to sanction the homeland of Bolivar?"" he asked, referring to the 19th Century Venezuelan independence leader. Relations between Venezuela and the US have been tense for years and correspondents say these sanctions could mark a further worsening of relations between the two countries. Deadly protests The US Senate on Monday approved the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act. The bill targets current and former Venezuelan officials who directed ""significant acts of violence or serious human rights abuses against persons associated with the anti-government protests in Venezuela that began on 4 February"". More than 40 people from both sides of the political divide were killed in the protests which took place in Venezuela between February and May. The United Nations condemned ""all violence by all sides in Venezuela"" and called on the government ""to ensure that people are not penalised for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and to freedom of expression"". The government said opposition leaders had incited protesters to violence and had been planning a coup against President Maduro. The opposition said its activists had been unfairly targeted for their political convictions. At the height of the protests in February, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was arrested. He has been charged with inciting violence. And last week Venezuela's chief prosecutor launched an investigation into leading opposition politician Maria Corina Machado over an alleged plot to assassinate the president.",The United States Congress has passed a bill which would impose sanctions on Venezuelan officials found to have violated protesters' rights.
"Figures showed 18,000 vergées (8021 acres) were used for growing Jersey Royals in 2011, compared to 16,745 (7442 acres) in 2010. The increase in land used for potatoes offset a reduced yield, which was caused by drought, the department said. Export sales of potatoes dropped by £0.6m from £31.4m in 2010, to £30.8m in 2011. The department said the amount of land used for orchards also increased in 2011, citing a growing demand for cider as the reason. 2011 also saw new greenhouses built for the first time in a number of years, which the department stated was the reason behind a growth in tomato production locally.","More land has been used for growing potatoes in Jersey, according to the States' Environment Department."
"By Tom EsslemontBBC News, Dublin If they could change minds with volume alone they might just stop the Irish government in its tracks. Filling out Merrion Square in central Dublin on a cold January Saturday are men, women and children on shoulders, carrying photos of babies and pink and yellow banners emblazoned with anti-abortion slogans. The groups taking part - Youth Defence, Pro Life Ireland and the Catholic organisation, the Iona Institute - testify to the polemical nature of the debate here. ""Keep Your Promise!"" they shout - a direct reference to a 2011 election pledge by the main party in Ireland's coalition not to legislate for abortion. They face a similarly vocal pro-choice movement, reinvigorated by the death of an Indian dentist from Galway. Campaign Savita Halappanavar died last October after suffering a miscarriage. Her husband said that her request for an abortion had been refused by hospital doctors. This point has still not been proven and an inquest is underway to determine what actually happened. Nevertheless, Mrs Halappanavar's death was turned into a campaign by pro-choice campaigners to urge people to back the government's planned legislation. They used posters of Mrs Halappanavar captioned with the words ""never again"" to express their opinion. The government is expected to issue the exact wording of its proposed new law in the coming months. Patricia Casey, a psychiatrist well known for her anti-abortion views, feels let down. ""This government made a promise to the people, then suddenly they have changed [their minds]. ""The announcement was made shortly before Christmas and they seem to be going at quite a pace and I think it is because the Irish government doesn't want to give people time to think about it,"" says Prof Casey. But pro-choice campaigners say the proposed legislation does not go far enough. They argue that more than 4,000 women travel to the UK annually to terminate their pregnancies, because of the restrictions. The proposed new legislation will only affect a small number - only those mothers whose lives are directly at risk. Equal rights Abortion in such circumstances was already, technically, legal. In 1983, Irish people voted to adopt an anti-abortion amendment into the constitution giving equal rights to life to both the mother and the unborn. But, in 1992, a suicidal 14-year-old rape victim, known only as X, was barred from leaving Ireland to terminate her pregnancy. The case sparked a major row at home and abroad. In the end the Supreme Court ruled that X was constitutionally entitled to a termination because she was suicidal and there was a real and substantial threat to her life as a mother. She ended up miscarrying. Some doctors have felt there was still a great lack of clarity as to when they could carry out an abortion without risk of prosecution. Pro-choice groups feel a doctor's personal and even religious beliefs may play a part in their decision-making. Since the X Case, six successive Irish governments have avoided the issue. Now the government's proposed legislation is widely expected to include cases where the pregnant woman feels suicidal. Such a change in legislation would not include cases of rape or those of foetal anomalies that pose no threat to the mother's life. Sensitive debate The new law would have made no difference to someone like Gaye Edwards. In February 2001, following a 21-week scan, she was told her unborn had a rare abnormality meaning it would not survive outside the womb. ""The consultant [in Dublin] came back and scanned us in absolute silence. ""Then told us that our child had a condition that was incompatible with life. It's a phrase they use in situations like ours. Incompatible with life. We all know exactly what it means."" Given no option was available to have an abortion in Ireland she travelled to the UK, where her son was medically induced. He died moments later. She was one of the first women to go public about her termination. It is still relatively uncommon for people to talk freely about it, so she regularly meets with members of a small Dublin-based support group called Termination for Medical Reasons. On the wider public's reaction to her story she says: ""Nobody has come to us and expressed a view that we did the wrong thing"". ""I've tried to avoid the paranoia of reading into silence. You know, if someone is silent you think they must object to what we have done."" Gaye argues that in certain cases it is fairer for parents to be allowed to abort in Ireland, where they can be cared for by their family members instead of having to travel far from home. The government, for its part, is taking things one step at a time, wary of the sensitive nature of the debate. A parliamentary committee has been hearing expert testimony on the risk of potential suicide to a mother's life and that of the unborn. Experts included doctors from hospitals where a handful of abortions have already been carried out. One of the speakers, Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin, told the hearing in January that her staff would not hesitate to abort a pregnancy when the mother's life was at risk. On suicide she adds, ""when women are so distressed that they are willing to take their own lives, they need to be listened to, they need to be believed and they need appropriate medical care"". Anti-abortion campaigners deny that potential suicide should be grounds for an abortion. ""I have assessed women - who are sometimes suicidal when they are pregnant,"" says Patricia Casey. ""There is no evidence that offering an abortion when [women] are suicidal actually works,"" she adds. Patricia Casey says the issue is about human rights, not religious faith. But those who are Catholic and attend church find the anti-abortion message hard to ignore. During mass, priests across the country stress the importance of every human being's right to life from the moment of conception until natural death. While many Catholics remain devoted to the church's official position, some of those I spoke to after a service at St Theresa's Church in Dublin feel conflicted. ""It is unfair of the Catholic religion to impose their views,"" said one of the few churchgoers who would talk, stating that she was not in favour of abortion. ""That said, I think the mother has the right to decide,"" she added. With Catholicism's importance in Ireland waning - church membership is shrinking and there are fewer priests entering the profession - might Ireland be witnessing a gradual shift in public opinion, catalysed by the Savita Halappanavar case? A poll in December last year found eight out 10 people would support laws which allow abortion where the mother's life is threatened, including by suicide. Losing standing According to Fintan O'Toole, columnist at the Irish Times, the softening of the public stance on abortion seems to reflect, in part, this weakening grip of Catholicism in the Republic of Ireland following the Church's child abuse scandal. ""Not only do we now know that there was widespread abuse by clergy, but more damaging was the way bishops systematically covered up that abuse,"" he says. ""Over that period the hierarchy lost its moral standing. There are relatively few people left in Ireland who would see themselves as taking their moral bearing from the Catholic hierarchy. And that's a huge change,"" he says. Some people feel the legislation is too restrictive. Gaye hopes that in the future the law may be extended to cases where the unborn is deemed unviable. ""I'd like to think that me talking about my son will make a difference in the long run,"" she tells me. ""The more volume there is the more it will help. One story isn't going to make a difference but maybe the synergy of all the stories will,"" she says. The anti-abortion lobby, though, sees any legislation as having the potential to pave the way to a further easing of legislation and the possibility that abortion may soon be available ""on demand"". And that is why the government is taking things one step at a time.",Ireland's anti-abortion campaigners have an important weapon - their voice.
"Women and a child were killed in the crossfire as clashes broke out earlier this week, the BBC has learned. Most of Sirte, the hometown of former leader Muammar Gaddafi, fell to IS earlier this year. IS is one of a number of groups battling for control of Libya and has made advances across the country. Fighting broke out in a residential area of Sirte on Monday between Islamic State and a Salafist Muslim group backed by angry armed civilians. It followed the death of a Muslim cleric who - along with others in the neighbourhood - had refused to comply with IS's order for residents to pledge allegiance or face death, a local journalist told the Associated Press. The BBC has been told that most of the 25 people who had been killed were armed civilians who had joined the fighting. One report said IS had taken back the neighbourhood, although this has not been confirmed. IS faced a similar battle in the eastern port city of Derna in June - the first city outside Iraq and Syria to fall to the group - and was pushed back by an al-Qaeda affiliated group. Since Col Gaddafi's death in Sirte in October 2011, Libya has descended into chaos, with various militias fighting for power. The internationally-recognised government has been forced to leave Tripoli. In the past year, IS has set up checkpoints and established a presence in cities across Libya. In January, an IS-affiliated group bombed the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, killing 10 people. In February and April, videos were released showing IS militants in Libya killing two groups of mainly Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians. Air strikes against IS positions have been conducted by the Egyptian air force and by Libya's internationally-recognised government. Libya's rival power bases",At least 25 people have been killed in clashes between Islamic State (IS) and a rival Islamist group backed by armed civilians in the Libyan city of Sirte.
"The missile was destroyed over the capital and fragments landed in the airport area, officials quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said. A TV channel linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen said the missile was fired at the King Khalid International Airport. The civil aviation authority said that air traffic was not disrupted. Saudi forces have reported shooting down Houthi missiles in the past , though none has come so close to a major population centre. ""The missile was launched indiscriminately to target the civilian and populated areas,"" said Turki al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen. ""Shattered fragments from the intercepted missile landed in an uninhabited area of the airport and there were no injuries."" Witnesses reported seeing parts of the missile in the airport's car park, Saudi broadcaster Al-Arabiya reported. Residents in the north of Riyadh said their windows were rattled by a loud blast on Saturday evening that was followed by the roar of low-flying aircraft. The Houthi-run Saba News in Yemen said the missile had been a Burkan H2. The rebel group is believed to have access to a stockpile of Scud ballistic missiles and home-grown variants. Saudi forces have previously brought them down with Patriot surface-to-air missiles bought from the US. The Houthis fired a missile towards Riyadh in May, a day before US President Donald Trump was due to arrive in the city for a visit, but it was shot down 200km (120 miles) from the capital. Yemen has been devastated by a war between forces loyal to the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and those allied to the Houthi rebel movement. Saudi Arabia is leading a campaign to defeat the Houthis, and is the biggest power in an international air coalition that has bombed the rebel group since 2015. On Wednesday a suspected strike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 26 people at a hotel and market in northern Yemen, medics and local officials said. The coalition, which rights groups say has bombed schools, hospitals, markets and residential areas, said it struck a ""legitimate military target"". UN-brokered talks have failed to bring an end to the bloodshed in Yemen, which has claimed more than 8,600 lives and injured nearly 50,000 since the Saudi-led campaign began. The conflict has also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 884,000 people and caused 2,184 deaths.","Saudi Arabia says it has intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen, after a loud explosion was heard near Riyadh airport on Saturday evening."
"The ferry firm, which carries about a million passengers every year between Portsmouth, Poole, Guernsey, Jersey and St Malo, was put up for sale in 2018. The purchase was announced in November, but had to be approved by regulators before it could be finalised. ""The new shareholders share our vision for maintaining and developing ferry services,"" said Condor boss Paul Luxon. ""We will be working with them, along with local stakeholders, on long-term plans that include fleet replacement and investment."" Condor Ferries Founded in 1964 by Channel Island businessmen Peter Dorey and Jack Norman, Condor operated passenger services between the Channel Islands and France. The ferry network was expanded in 1987 when the company launched the first route connecting the Channel Islands with the UK. Condor currently operates with four ships, including the high-speed vessels Rapide and Liberation, all-weather Commodore Clipper and freight ship Commodore Goodwill. The operator, which has its headquarters in Poole and is registered in Guernsey, carries more than 200,000 passenger vehicles and 100,000 freight vehicles to and from the islands each year. The consortium that has bought the firm is made up of Columbia Threadneedle European Sustainable Infrastructure Fund and Brittany Ferries, which operates between the UK, France, Spain and Ireland. Chief executive Mr Luxon said: ""As a company, Condor's immediate focus is to continue preparing for the season. ""We fully recognise we play a vital role in supporting the visitor economies of Jersey and Guernsey alongside our commitment, for over 70 years, to providing essential freight services and travel options for islanders."" Christophe Mathieu, CEO of Brittany Ferries which is the minority shareholder of Condor, said: ""We are committed to working closely in the months and years to come to ensure the best level of service to customers and support to our friends and colleagues in the Channel Islands. ""This will be business as usual for Condor.""",The sale of Condor Ferries to Brittany Ferries and an investment fund has been completed.
"The two groups murdered, raped, ""enslaved"" and committed other ""inhuman acts"" against civilians, they said. The Kasai region, once one of the most prosperous and peaceful in DR Congo, descended into violence in 2016. Long-simmering resentment exploded into rebellion against the government. In December the UN said the crisis was the highest level of emergency - the same level as the crises in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. It has claimed 3,000 lives and displaced 1.4 million people. In a report prepared for the UN Human Rights Council, investigators said government troops and members of the Bana Mura militia on one side of the conflict and the Kamwina Nsapu militia on the other side had all targeted civilians in a ""systematic or widespread manner"". ""A very serious problem of impunity persists, given the scale and gravity of these crimes,"" they added. Congolese Human Rights Minister Marie-Ange Mushobekwa said the government would respond to the accusations next week, Reuters reported. What is the fighting about? Communal clashes broke out after Kamwina Nsapu, a traditional chief, called for a popular uprising in June 2016 with the aim of removing all state institutions and security forces from the region. His followers had wanted his chiefdom to be officially recognised by the authorities. Kamwina Nsapu was killed two months later when the police raided his house, and his followers vowed to avenge his death. The conflict has since escalated, tapping into grievances over marginalisation in a region affected by poor infrastructure and where support for the Congolese opposition is widespread. The Kamwina Nsapu fighters - largely made up of child soldiers - have targeted state institutions, looting and burning local and national government offices. The UN report accuses them of murder, mutilation, rape and forcing children under 15 to fight. However, the UN has also condemned the army for using disproportionate force against fighters equipped with traditional weapons such as machetes, homemade rifles or even just sticks. Government troops have been supported by the Bana Mura militia, which the UN accuses of widespread atrocities including beheadings. DR Congo is set for a new election in December after President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his term in 2016. But it is unclear whether Mr Kabila will step down or if a political transition could help end the many conflicts in the country.",UN investigators have accused government troops and militiamen in the Democratic Republic of Congo of committing war crimes in the restive central Kasai region.
"By James CopnallBBC News, Khartoum The region is often described as ""oil-rich"", but after the 2009 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling in The Hague, most of the oil fields now fall outside Abyei's borders. It does still produce oil, but the real issue here is more ethnic than economic. Abyei is claimed by a southern group, the Dinka Ngok, and northern nomads, the Misseriya. The Misseriya spend part of each year grazing their cows in the area as part of a great trek into greener pastures which takes them deep into South Sudan, which is due to formally become independent from the north in July following decades of conflict. There are several prominent Dinka Ngok in both the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which fought for the south's independence, and in the SPLM, its political wing. Armed groups of Misseriya were often used as a proxy army by Khartoum during the civil war. The north fears alienating the Misseriya, who also live in the combustible neighbouring state of Southern Kordofan. So both Khartoum and Juba have strong reasons to care about a seemingly insignificant patch of land. Tensions in Abyei grew once a referendum scheduled for January on whether to join the north or the south did not take place. There was no agreement on whether the nomadic Misseriya were eligible to vote. A string of clashes followed, but this latest incident, involving direct confrontation between the northern and southern armed forces, is by far the most serious. Northern military might Following what they described as a ""southern ambush"" on their men on Thursday, the northern army seized control of Abyei town, the capital of a disputed border region, on Saturday. To drive the point home about who is now in charge, President Omar al-Bashir issued a decree dissolving Abyei's joint administration, which was headed by a southerner. The US and the UN condemned what they essentially characterised as a southern provocation followed by a northern over-reaction. The UN Security Council made it clear these events would not affect southern independence on 9 July. But nobody can say for sure whether it will be a peaceful divorce. There are three main scenarios for what could happen next: The most likely is that the north will keep control of Abyei. They would start from a very strong position in the negotiations about the region's future, which would please the Misseriya. However the south might be able to score some negotiating points since Abyei was taken by force. A second possibility is that the northern troops will withdraw after some time. The UN Security Council said a northern official, Amin Hassan Omar, made this commitment to it. If this is the case, the northern armed forces will have shown their superiority, not least in terms of equipment, over the south. The northern army rolled into Abyei with numerous tanks, following aerial bombardments and shelling, easily dispersing a numerically inferior opposition. This reinforced the prevailing wisdom in Sudan that the southern armed forces do not have the technology or training to fight a conventional battle with the north. That is perhaps a useful message for the north to hammer home, in the light of the charged negotiations taking place on Abyei, as well as on other issues like economic resources, and in particular oil. 'Precipice of war' The last possibility is a return to all-out conflict. US Senator John Kerry, who has visited Sudan several times, describes the country as ""ominously close to the precipice of war"". This could be triggered by a southern military response to the northern takeover of Abyei, or further northern moves. But the initial southern public statements have been cautious, calling on the UN to get Khartoum out of Abyei, rather than threatening to counter-attack. The southern army is stretched, as it has to deal with several rebellions, including in Unity State just over the border from Abyei. The south firmly believes Khartoum is funding the rebellions, a charge the northern authorities have always denied. Campaigner John Prendergast of the US-based Enough Project sees domestic political reasons why Khartoum might want to fight. He says the influential former head of National Security, Nafie Ali Nafie, has won an internal struggle for control of President Bashir's National Congress Party's direction. ""Nafie is escalating in Darfur, Abyei, and throughout the south, seeking to address Khartoum's political problems with military force,"" he told the BBC. ""If the Security Council fails to grapple with this trend, we will see full-scale national war in Sudan by the time the south becomes an independent state on July 9th."" Influential Sudanese journalist Mahjoub Mohamed Salih goes further. ""What is now taking place [in Abyei] is by all standards a war between two countries,"" he wrote. He believes the solution is to give the region a special status under President Bashir and Southern President Salva Kiir, and remove all armed elements from it other than UN peacekeepers. The African Union mediation lead by former South African President Thabo Mbeki will undoubtedly have its own ideas on how to end the crisis too. The US has already explicitly linked progress on Abyei to removing Sudan from the list of countries it believes sponsors terrorism. But northern politicians believe the US has gone back on several promises to improve its relationship with Khartoum in the last few years, weakening US leverage. Whatever happens next in Abyei and in north and South Sudan, there is no doubt the clash between the two armed forces has brought the spectre of a devastating new war considerably closer. Journalist Mahjoub Mohamed Salih asks the question on everyone's mind. ""Shall we now sacrifice peace for which we paid so dearly for a limited piece of land in which both sides have undeniable rights?""",Abyei town may not look like much - a few low brick buildings scattered amongst thatched huts and dusty tracks - but this normally sleepy place is raising fears of a new Sudanese war after northern forces seized control over the weekend.
"By Paul KirbyBBC News Most of the Ukrainian government forces have pulled out of the town, a key transport hub. A new truce deal was reached on 12 February through international mediation, in an attempt to stop the fighting spiralling out of control. What prompted the flare-up in a conflict that has cost more than 5,600 lives and few saw coming? How did eastern Ukraine return to full-scale conflict? Fighting started in April 2014 and raged for months until Ukraine and the separatists came to a deal on 5 September to halt the violence and free prisoners. But the ceasefire never held entirely. Both sides used the relative lull to build up their forces and for months the rebels tried to seize Donetsk airport, a strategic and symbolic asset, from government forces. With the start of 2015, a new rebel push began and by 22 January the airport was in their hands. Donetsk airport - coveted prize Violence flared the length of the September ceasefire line and casualties mounted: Ghost town captured by rebels Will the new ceasefire work? The deal struck on 12 February in Minsk by the leaders of Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia is similar to the old one, but tries to tackle some of its shortcomings. For the rebels, the new ceasefire line is the same as the old one, so they lose some of the territory they have gained. But government forces must pull back from the current front-line, and territory they have lost since January is confirmed as lost. But a key omission from the deal was Debaltseve - because the sides could not agree about who would end up controlling it. Even if the bloodshed stops and the guns fall silent, the future status of the rebel-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk remains unclear. Ukraine is adamant there is no new deal on autonomy for the rebel areas, only decentralisation - so that could anger the rebels. And it is difficult imagining the rebels agreeing to hold elections under Ukrainian law in their areas, just as it is seeing Ukraine getting back control of its eastern border. Both conditions are part of the 13-point plan agreed in Minsk. So what is in the 13-point plan? Ukraine's war: The human cost Source: Figures from UN reports, 6 and 17 February Why did the September ceasefire break down? Each side accused the other of tearing up the peace deal. For the government, it was the rebels' decision to hold their own local elections in November 2014, in defiance of the Kiev authorities. The separatists were then angered by the government decision to scrap the special status of their two regions, Donetsk and Luhansk. Among the terms of the truce were a commitment to pull back heavy guns from the front line by at least 15km (9 miles), a release of prisoners and an agreement for international observers to monitor the truce and a buffer zone on the Ukrainian border with Russia. Ukraine would also grant wider self-rule to Donetsk and Luhansk. Both sides used the ceasefire to rearm, but the rebels now appear to have better quality tanks and weapons than the government. The ceasefire that never was Russia tests new weaponry in Ukraine Who has the upper hand now? The rebels certainly have made big gains, with the capture of Donetsk airport and the assault on Debaltseve. The airport gave them a strategic asset a few miles from the centre of Donetsk city, their biggest stronghold. Even before the airport had been captured, Ukraine accused separatist forces of seizing more than 500 sq km (194 sq miles), mainly around Debaltseve and Mariupol. Casualties on both sides have been heavy, and journalists say the separatists have suffered major losses. Ukrainian forces made significant gains last summer, many of which have not been reversed. The separatists opened up a coastal front by the Sea of Azov before the September ceasefire, moving within range of the port city of Mariupol, but the ultranationalist pro-government Azov battalion recaptured some villages outside the city in early February. Why did the fighting start in the first place? In April 2014, pro-Russian activists seized control of government buildings in towns and cities across the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The events were a repeat of what had happened in Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. Gunmen there seized government buildings in February 2014 and raised the Russian flag a week after elected President Viktor Yanukovych, friendly to Moscow, fled during massive pro-EU street protests in Kiev. An early attempt by nationalists to remove the status of Russian as a second language alarmed many Russian speakers, and officials in Moscow portrayed the new leaders in Kiev as US-backed Ukrainian nationalists bent on violating minority rights. A flawed referendum on joining Russia was quickly held in Crimea and within a month the peninsula's annexation was complete. There was little bloodshed in Crimea, but Ukraine's fledgling revolutionary government was in no position to fight back, with only 6,000 troops reportedly ready for combat. However, when pro-Russian separatists made a move on Ukraine's industrial east and Russian forces appeared to be building up on the borders, the authorities in Kiev ordered an ""anti-terrorist operation"".",Pro-Russian rebels have entered the strategic town of Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine after heavy fighting - despite a ceasefire agreement.
"The family of Dr Ulrich Klopfer discovered the remains while sorting through the doctor's property after his death on 3 September. Dr Klopfer had a clinic in South Bend, Indiana, which closed down when his licence was revoked in 2016. He was accused of failing to report abortions performed on a 13-year-old girl to authorities. He also failed to ensure staff were present during procedures, AP reported. The doctor, whose records show he was an osteopathic physician, said he had never lost a patient in 43 years of carrying out abortions. ""Women get pregnant, men don't,"" Dr. Klopfer said during the hearing, according to the New York Times. ""We need to respect women making a decision that they think is best in their life.

"The motion to remove Shahid Shafi from his position as vice chairman of the Tarrant County Republican party failed by a vote of 139-49 on Thursday night. The effort was led by several county Republicans who argued that Dr Shafi was more loyal to Islam than the US. The movement led to criticism from prominent state Republican officials. Speaking to reporters after the vote at a church in Fort Worth, Dr Shafi said: ""As an immigrant to this great country, I am honoured and privileged to receive the support of my fellow Republicans."" ""We were fighting for religious freedom - a founding principle of our nation. And today, we have come out victorious,"" he declared. In addition to serving as the Republican vice chairman of Tarrant County - the third largest county in Texas - Dr Shafi is a surgeon and Southlake City Councilman who immigrated to the US nearly 30 years ago. He reportedly is originally from India, and became a US citizen in 2009. 'Because he is Muslim' After he was appointed by party officials to his post in July 2018, several of his colleagues took issue with his religion and claimed he had connections with terrorist organisations. Grand Prairie precinct chairwoman Dorrie O'Brien, who led the effort to oust him, recently reiterated her views in a Facebook post. ""We don't think he's suitable as a practising Muslim to be vice chair because he'd be the representative for ALL Republicans in Tarrant County, and not ALL Republicans in Tarrant County think Islam is safe or acceptable,"" Mrs O'Brien wrote on 31 December 2018. ""There are big questions surrounding exactly where Dr Shafi's loyalties lie, vis a vis Democrat and Republican policies."" She also previously slammed her Republican colleagues for not intervening in what she called a ""stealth jihad"" and ""Leftist/Shari'a Zuckerberg-ization of Tarrant County"". Tarrant County Republican Party Chairman Darl Eason, who appointed Dr Shafi to his post, told the Star-Telegram when the vote was scheduled: ""It's just outrageous that we are doing this."" ""It's disgusting,"" he added. Former Tarrant County precinct chair Sara Legvold sat outside of the meeting room during the vote in protest, wearing a burqa which she said was to ""represent the Islamisation of our county, our state and our country"". The vote was widely condemned by Texas Republican, including Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz and Republican Land Commissioner George P Bush. ""Religious freedom is at the core of who we are as a nation and state,"" Gov Abbott said in a statement on Wednesday, ""and attacks on Dr Shafi because of his faith are contrary to this guiding principle.""",A Republican county official in Texas has survived a vote to oust him after several local party members took issue with his Muslim religion.
"The quake and the massive landslides it triggered killed approximately 70,000 people. A wall of ice came loose from Peru's highest mountain, Mount Huascarán, careered down the mountain at incredible speed and buried the town of Yungay. A statue of Christ in the town's cemetery and four palm trees were all that remained of Yungay. In nearby Ranrahirca, 20,000 people were killed, leaving only 400 survivors. It was not the first time Ranrahirca had been devastated. Only eight years earlier, 2,000 people had been killed in a similar landslide which also devastated seven more neighbouring towns. But the 1970 quake, which has since become known as the Great Peruvian Earthquake, eclipsed that of 1962. The worst-affected areas were Ancash and La Libertad in Peru, but the tremors could be felt as far away as Brazil. Houses built from adobe, such as these in Huaraz, the capital of the Ancash region, could not withstand these forces of nature. The epicentre of the earthquake was located 35km off the coast of Casma and Chimbote on the Pacific Ocean, where the Nazca Plate meets the South American Plate. The 7.9-magnitude quake struck on a Sunday afternoon at 15:23 local time and lasted 45 seconds. But it was the landslides which followed which caused much of the damage. Their force was such that a lorry and a bus could barely been made out after they had been swept along by the mudslide. A boulder estimated to have weighed 700 tonnes was swept along and came to rest near Ranrahirca. Aerial photographs showed the size of slide of glacial ice and rocks which careered down the mountain at an average speed of 160kmh (100mph). The landslide piled mounds of debris up to 15m high - as pointed out by the arrows in the photograph below - and the melted ice from the glacier formed small lakes. Homes and businesses, such as the power company which used to stand on the site pictured below, were completely destroyed. The wave of mud and debris was 20m deep at this point and swept away the homes which had stood in the foreground of the picture. The fence posts in the foreground are bent in the direction of the flow of the mudslide. With 50,000 people killed, 20,000 missing and presumed dead, and another 150,000 injured, the Great Peruvian Earthquake is considered one of the world's most destructive quakes to this day.

"US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said waivers were granted to India, South Korea, Malaysia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Turkey. Under a US law signed in December, countries have until 28 June to greatly reduce oil imports from Iran or be cut off from the US financial system. The aim is to pile pressure on Iran to stop its uranium enrichment programme. Washington and its allies believe Tehran is secretly trying to make nuclear weapons, a claim strongly denied by the Iranians. Mrs Clinton said the latest exemptions proved that sanctions were working. ""By reducing Iran's oil sales, we are sending a decisive message to Iran's leaders: Until they take concrete actions to satisfy the concerns of the international community, they will continue to face increasing isolation and pressure,"" she said in a statement. Pressure on China In March the US granted exceptions to Japan and 10 EU countries for cutting their imports of Iranian petroleum. Correspondents say the latest move puts pressure on China, which is Iran's biggest oil customer, to also cut its imports. US officials have said that Washington remains in talks with Beijing over the issue, AFP news agency reports. The US says Iranian oil exports have fallen from about 2.5 million barrels a day last year to between 1.2 and 1.8 million barrels a day. Last week, the UN's nuclear watchdog said talks in Vienna aimed at getting greater access to Iran's nuclear sites had ended without progress. Further talks between Iran and six powers - Britain, the US, China, Russia, France and Germany - are due to be held in Moscow next week. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful means.",The US has exempted seven countries from economic sanctions in return for cutting imports of Iranian oil.
"Carrie GracieChina editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter Afternoon tea in the Shanghai Peninsula Hotel is reminiscent of the days when the British ran the world's greatest trading empire. Then, as now, Shanghai was the money capital of China and afternoon tea was a ritual featuring crisp tablecloths, silver tea service and business gossip. The big difference now is that Britain no longer runs the empire. With a population 20 times as large, China has the scale advantage and the shoe is now on the other foot. The last British government worked hard at attracting Chinese investment, embarking on what it called a golden decade with Beijing. But the new prime minister has delayed a key nuclear power project, reportedly due to concerns about Chinese involvement. So just as Brexit Britain is looking to new economic partners to replace the European Union, will national security concerns rock its relationship with China? Across the table from me, sipping English tea (milk, no sugar), Joselyn Zhou is untroubled. She acquired the English tea habit last year while studying for an MBA at Durham University. At 34 years old, this Shanghainese is already a business veteran. And while studying in the north-east of England, she kept close watch on small British enterprises she believes have the potential to make it big in China. Her first target is a digital platform for occupational training courses, as she believes China has the technology but not enough content. ""From my perspective, the UK is still an attractive destination,"" she says. ""It is a centre for talented people. If you can retain that quality and attract bright business talent in, I don't see any negative effects. ""And for a new prime minister, checking everything is reasonable. I don't see long-term tension. The two countries will solve things in a diplomatic way."" In Ms Zhou's view, whether it is a company or a government, when facing the might of China, it all comes down to having something worth selling. When the UK leaves the EU and has to negotiate trade deals with China alone, she says, it will have less leverage, so quality will be even more important. ""You have nations that are small but their standards and quality are high, so it is all about what you have to offer,"" she says. Ms Zhou is not the only one optimistic about the future of the UK-China relationship. Larry Wang runs a consultancy arranging visas for Chinese investors in the UK and has seen intense demand post-Brexit. ""The UK remains a dream country for lots of Chinese people. If possible they would like their children to be educated in the UK for a period of time,"" he says. ""They don't make decisions on political reasons, but on their own economic benefits. It doesn't matter if the UK remains in the European Union or not."" A lawyer I get chatting to on a train tells me the British bargains for China's moneyed classes go beyond education, to holidays, property and business. ""If there is an opportunity for them to invest and they see valuable assets, that will prompt an overall investment shopping spree,"" he says. ""And as a tourist, everything is more affordable. ""Basically, China has never been this rich, and London has never been this affordable."" He himself is about to take his family to the UK on holiday, and many of his friends are buying property. But he urges the British government to quash doubts about Chinese intentions and national security. ""There are people who are very sceptical and suspicious about Chinese expansion worldwide,"" he says. ""To me, this is not justified. Everyone needs to make money. ""You really should grab this opportunity and maximise your profit. ""That is what English people are very good at."" The most sombre assessment of British prospects I meet in China this week comes from a man who still has to promote them. Joerg Wuttke represents the European Chamber of Commerce, and, while acknowledging the UK's strong financial services, soft power and good will in China, he gave me a long list of reasons to be gloomy about what will happen when the UK finally leaves the EU and has to negotiate its own trade deals with China. ""It's going to be difficult,"" he says. ""First, the Chinese hate uncertainty. Second, you have past promises that when you enter London you're in the middle of Europe. This is not the case any more. Thirdly, if you invest heavily in the United Kingdom and then have your currency devalued by 10%, that already sends a message to Beijing. ""And the last point, Hinkley Point… is the UK a trusted partner when it comes to Chinese companies operating a nuclear power station or not? For China, this is very difficult to swallow possibly. Are we trusted partners or not?"" Is the list long enough? Mr Wuttke is also worried the UK does not have enough experienced trade negotiators to handle negotiations. And it is at this point that the real challenge begins. ""It will find it has no leverage,"" he says. ""The UK already has the most open market. China's is closed. China doesn't trade on good will; you have to trade with something. ""For the UK, it will take five to 10 years if it wants to negotiate a free trade agreement."" The irony is that what was intended as a golden decade for UK-China ties may turn into a tortuous decade of trade talks. But at least there will be British bargains for Chinese buyers along the way.","Brexit will mean Britain having to find new economic partners, so what are the prospects of a stronger trading relationship with China?"
"People wanting broadband internet currently need a fixed telephone line from either JT in Jersey or Cable & Wireless in Guernsey. John Curran, the islands' regulator said customers wanted more choice. He said: ""The benefits of greater competition are readily seen when looking at the mobile sectors."" A joint initiative between Guernsey and Jersey involving telecom operators and the regulator has found a number of wholesale products they say would ""allow for a more even playing field."" 'Greater price competition' Mr Curran said: ""This would be in competition with those that currently control much of the infrastructure. ""The benefits of greater competition are readily seen when looking at the mobile sectors in Guernsey and Jersey, with a wider variety of packages and greater price competition, particularly since mobile number portability was introduced to both islands in 2008. ""We believe the introduction of these kinds of products which would allow consumers to take all their fixed services from a choice of service providers will deliver real savings to consumers."" Currently telecom operators are limited to what they can offer as the incumbent operators set the features of the wholesale products they sell.

"Richard Burr of North Carolina said he had decided to do so because he did not want the investigation to distract the committee from its work. Mr Burr's phone has been seized by the FBI as part of the inquiry. The senator, who denies wrongdoing, allegedly used inside information to avoid market losses from coronavirus. He declined a request for comment. Mr Burr and his wife sold as much as $1.7m (£1.4m) of equities in February, just before markets plunged on fears of an economic crisis. It is illegal for members of Congress to trade based on non-public information gathered during their official duties. Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, as well as Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, also reportedly sold holdings before the downturn, but are not confirmed to be under investigation. Ms Feinstein said she had answered questions from the FBI regarding trades made by her husband, however. Why is Burr stepping back? Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Mr Burr had contacted him to inform of his decision to step aside temporarily. ""We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow [Friday],"" Mr McConnell said in a statement. Mr Burr said: ""The work the Intelligence Committee and its members do is too important to risk hindering in any way. I believe this step is necessary to allow the Committee to continue its essential work free of external distractions."" He turned over his mobile phone to authorities after federal agents issued and executed a search warrant at his Washington, DC, home. What are the allegations exactly? The justice department began investigating Mr Burr, 64, in March. Public disclosures first investigated by ProPublica show the senator sold more than 30 stocks between late January and mid-February. Some of the stocks were in sectors now devastated by the coronavirus outbreak, such as the hotel, restaurant and shipping industries. As chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Mr Burr receives nearly daily briefings on threats to US national security. He defended the transactions, saying he had ""relied solely on public news reports"" to instruct his decision to sell. However, he was criticised for publicly downplaying the seriousness of the virus, even as he privately sold equities and warned a private North Carolina business group of the stark risks it posed. Mr Burr's lawyer, Alice Fisher, said in March the senator welcomed the justice department investigation because it would ""establish that his actions were appropriate"". ""The law is clear that any American - including a Senator - may participate in the stock market based on public information, as Senator Burr did, she said. The bulk of Mr Burr's sales occurred on 13 February, just before his speech to the wealthy business constituent group about the dire economic impact of the coronavirus, at a time when the Trump administration was publicly downplaying the threat. In an audio recording, obtained by US outlet National Public Radio (NPR) he also told the group to curtail their travel. Mr Burr has accused NPR of ""misrepresenting"" his speech. Who is Richard Burr? First elected to the Senate in 2004, he chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee when it investigated Russian election interference in the 2016 presidential election. The committee endorsed intelligence community findings that Russia had interfered on Donald Trump's behalf.

"Five people were injured in the attack at the South Hedland Square centre - two of them are in a serious condition. Witnesses told local media they saw a man waving ""a great big knife"" at shoppers and police officers, before hearing screaming and bangs. WA Premier Mark McGowan called it ""a tragic and awful set of events"". ""He has been tasered by police, that didn't stop him. He lunged at police officers and then he was shot by police officers,"" the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Mr McGowan as saying. Police said there was no ongoing threat to public safety and are appealing for people to come forward with any video evidence. There has been no suggestion the incident was terror-related. The attack happened around 10:00 local time on Friday (02:00 GMT). One woman told ABC she fled after encountering the man outside the shopping centre's entrance. ""I saw this guy swinging a great big knife at this lady who had a toddler in the trolley,"" Shelley Farquhar said. ""Then he gave up on her and came in, because I was there, and was swinging at me."" Pilbara District Police confirmed the man who died was a ""person who was engaged by police, and he received a gunshot wound"". ""Police will investigate the circumstances surrounding how these people received the injuries,"" it said in a statement. South Hedland is a small town in the rural Pilbara region of Western Australia. Most people in the area work in mining and related industries. The dead man, who has not been identified, was reported by several witnesses to have been wearing a high-vis jacket.",Police in Western Australia have shot dead a man after several people were stabbed at a shopping centre in the Pilbara region.
"The civil aviation ministry said the pilots had been ""taken off the roster pending inquiry"". Jet Airways said it was co-operating with the investigation. Reports said the pilot was taking ""a nap as per rules"", and the co-pilot said she was ""busy on her tablet"". ""The co-pilot, who was supposed to hold fort in the cockpit, claims she was busy on her tablet and did not notice that the aircraft had lost altitude,"" The Times of India reported. The plane was pulled back to its assigned height after the co-pilot received a call from the alarmed air traffic controller alerting it about the drop. The paper added that the aviation authorities were investigating whether the co-pilot had dozed off or accidently pressed some button on her work tablet leading to the descent. The aviation watchdog - the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - said it viewed the descent as ""a serious incident"". The pilots have been questioned about the incident and a ""detailed investigation"" has been ordered into the incident, the DGCA said in a statement. Jet Airways said it had also initiated an ""internal inquiry"" into the matter. ""Safety is of paramount importance to Jet Airways, as is also the welfare of our guests and crew and the airline will always take appropriate steps to ensure the same,"" the airline said in a statement. The incident took place last Friday on Jet Airway's Mumbai-Brussels flight, reports said. Jet Airways is India's second largest airline and flies on both domestic and international routes.","India's aviation watchdog is probing reports that a Jet Airways aircraft flying to Brussels suddenly dropped 5,000 feet over Ankara, alarming the Turkish air control authorities."
"The appeal on Sunday was made by the foreign ministers of the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US. The ministers said they were ""gravely concerned by the Hong Kong government's unjust disqualification of candidates"". They condemned a year-long postponement of September's elections as disproportionate. The chief executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, announced the delay at the end of July, blaming a rise in coronavirus infections in the territory. At the time, Hong Kong's outbreak appeared to be worsening, but daily cases have been declining since 30 July, when a record rise of 149 infections was reported. Opposition politicians and activists has accused the government of using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to stop people from voting. Hong Kong authorities disqualified 12 pro-democracy candidates from standing in the elections, deepening political tensions. Opposition activists had hoped to obtain a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo) in September's poll, capitalising on anger at Beijing's imposition of a controversial national security law in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 under an agreement meant to guarantee a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. But critics say that the territory's freedoms are being eroded. What did the statement say? In a joint statement, the five foreign ministers said moves to disqualify candidates and delay the elections ""have undermined the democratic process that has been fundamental to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity"". The ministers, including the UK's Dominic Raab, called for the disqualified legislators to be reinstated. The security law imposed by China was ""eroding the Hong Kong people's fundamental rights and liberties"", the minister said. ""We support the legitimate expectations of the people of Hong Kong to elect Legislative Council representatives via genuinely free, fair, and credible elections,"" they added. The statement comes at a time of heightened tensions between China and western governments, with Hong Kong's freedoms one of many issues causing acrimony. On Friday, the US imposed sanctions on a group of Chinese and Hong Kong officials - including city leader Ms Lam - involved in enforcing the security law. Earlier this week, the Trump administration moved to ban US transactions with the Chinese owners of the WeChat and TikTok apps. More on Hong Kong's security law:",The UK and four allies have urged Hong Kong's government to allow barred opposition candidates to contest delayed parliamentary elections.
"Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has been asked by the state governor to show he can form a government with a working majority by 12 October. If he is unable to do that, elections will follow. Correspondents say the revolt has been provoked by a recent cabinet reshuffle and corruption claims. Karnataka is the only southern Indian state where the BJP wields power. Fifteen BJP lawmakers and five independents sent a letter on Wednesday to the state governor saying they would no longer back Mr Yeddyurappa's administration. They included seven ministers, three of whom were BJP members. The other four were all independents, who have now been sacked by Mr Yeddyurappa. ""This government is corrupt. We need a new government that is efficient and stable,"" said Anand Asnotikar, one of the sacked ministers. The BJP had 116 lawmakers in the 224-member assembly before the mutiny. After talks with leaders of his party, Mr Yeddyurappa said: ""I will prove my majority. The people of Karnataka need not worry."" Correspondents say the central BJP party leadership is worried about what impact the government rift could have on assembly elections in Bihar and local elections in Uttar Pradesh this month. The BJP has been projecting Karnataka as the party's gateway to the south, where it has little influence. The revolt comes days after allegations surfaced of a land scandal involving the chief minister and one of his senior colleagues. Mr Yeddyurappa is accused of giving away government land in Bangalore to his family members. The son of IT Minister Katta Subramanya has been arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a key witness in a land scam case. Opposition parties have called on the state governor to sack Mr Naidu and Mr Yeddyurappa.",The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party government in India's Karnataka state has been reduced to a minority after 20 lawmakers withdrew support.
"It is unclear if Mr Amaral, who denies the charges, agreed to a plea bargain to testify against other suspects. He will be allowed to resume his duties in the Senate while Congress assesses impeachment proceedings against him. The investigation relates to the state oil company, Petrobras. Mr Amaral became the first sitting senator arrested in Brazilian history. He is a former leader of the governing Workers Party. Judge Teori Zavascki has ruled, however, that Mr Amaral will need to remain at home every night and at weekends. The senator had been secretly recorded allegedly discussing plans to help a detained official flee the country in return for not implicating Mr Amaral in a major corruption scandal at Petrobras. The official, Nestor Cervero, was accused of masterminding the corruption scheme. He signed a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors. 'Perplexed by the facts' The party has distanced itself from the senator since his arrest, which was requested by the Supreme Court and approved by a Senate vote in November. The executive committee suspended him in December and recommended his expulsion. Workers Party president Rui Falcao said at the time he was ""perplexed by the facts"" that led to the arrest. ""None of the acts attributed to the senator is connected to his activities for the party,"" Mr Falcao said in a statement. ""For that reason, the Workers Party does not feel obliged to lend him any solidarity."" One of Brazil's richest men, banker Andre Esteves, was arrested as part of the same operation. Mr Esteves, Brazil's 13th richest man, worth an estimated $2.5bn (£1.7bn), also denies the charges against him. The Petrobras scandal has damaged the popularity of President Dilma Rousseff, who was sworn in to a second four-year term in January 2015. Ms Rousseff is not implicated in the corruption scheme, but she was head of Petrobras during the years when much of the alleged corruption is believed to have taken place.","Brazilian Senator Delcidio do Amaral, arrested in November on charges of obstructing a corruption investigation, has left prison after a Supreme Court judge ordered his release."
"Some 6.9 million children died before the age of five last year, compared to 12 million such deaths in 1990. Almost 19,000 under-fives died daily in 2011. Unicef said some of the reduction was due to poorer countries getting richer. But some was also due to well-targeted aid such as encouraging breastfeeding or immunizing against common diseases. The sharpest drops in levels of child mortality were in countries that had received a lot of external assistance. ""If you look at the countries that have achieved the best results - the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Timor Leste and Liberia - those are the top three - I think in all of those three aid has been a very important contributor,"" said Unicef's UK director, David Bull. Efforts to target infectious diseases such as measles have cut related deaths globally from 500,000 in 2000 to 100,000 in 2011, Fragile situations Last year, half of global under-fives deaths occurred in just five countries, Unicef said - India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and China. In some, mainly sub-Saharan countries, the total number of deaths of children younger than five increased in 2001. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Somalia, Mali, Cameroon and Burkina Faso saw annual deaths of children under five rise by 10,000 or more in 2011 as compared with 1990. Nearly all of the roughly 500,000 malaria deaths in under-fives occurred in sub-Saharan African states last year, the agency said. Unicef said that conflict was a key contributing factor in child death: eight of the 10 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality in conflict or fragile situations. Across the planet, the five leading causes of deaths among children under five include pneumonia (18%); pre-term birth complications (14%); diarrhoea (11%); birth-related complications (9%) and malaria (7%). Unicef explained that nearly half - around 40% - of deaths among children under five occur during the first 28 days of life. In 2011 alone, these accounted for about three million deaths worldwide. Undernutrition, meanwhile, accounts for more than a third of such deaths.","The number of children dying before the age of five has fallen significantly over the past 20 years, the UN children's agency Unicef has said."
"The use of ""more economically viable"" aircraft for UK flights mean a ""physical base"" will no longer be needed, a spokesman said. Flights to and from Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester will continue to run as normal. But flights will be operated and crewed by staff from Stobart Air. Flybe's contract to transfer NHS patients to and from the UK will continue. The airline plans to replace two DeHavilland Q400 aircraft with ATR 72066s, which it said were more suited to shorter routes. Once both aircraft are in use in March, Stobart Air, which operates the services on behalf of Flybe, will take over ""full Isle of Man operations"". A ""phased"" closure of the base will be completed by the start of summer 2020, the spokesman said. The changes would have ""no impact on customers"", he added. Flybe previously confirmed the route between Ronaldsway and Heathrow was to end next month. The flights were launched in April but were not included in the airline's winter schedule, which starts on 27 October. A spokesman said the ""trial"" route was ""only introduced as part of the summer 2019 schedule"". Political member for ports Tim Baker MHK said, although the government was ""very happy"" the service had been introduced for the summer, there had not been the ""level of demand that perhaps there might have been for it"".","Flybe is scaling down its Isle of Man operations, closing its base at the island's airport and handing full control to partner Stobart Air."
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent A bail application for 40-year-old Ronan Hughes, of Leitrim, Silverstream, Tyholland, County Monaghan, took place on Wednesday. The bodies of the 39 were found in a lorry trailer in Grays last October. It had landed at Purfleet in Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Mr Hughes, who is being sought over the manslaughter of the 39 Vietnamese nationals as well as immigration offences, observed proceedings by video link from Cloverhill prison in Dublin. Objecting to bail, Garda (Irish police) Sgt Jim Kirwan said Mr Hughes has the ability to abscond and has connections throughout Europe. He said he has in the past registered a business in Bulgaria. Sgt Kirwan said Mr Hughes has a 2009 cigarette smuggling conviction that defrauded the UK revenue authorities of almost £1m as well as several motoring convictions. The officer told the High Court Mr Hughes has access to numerous vehicles and more than €200,000 (£173,000) in 33 bank accounts. He said Mr Hughes had also failed to present himself to British police for questioning despite requests to do so. In video evidence, Mr Hughes confirmed he had a Northern Ireland driving licence using his wife's home address in Armagh. However, he admitted he never lived there. The father-of-two estimated his haulage business had a turnover of between €500,000 (£433,000) and €600,000 (£520,000), but said his business wasn't very profitable. Mr Justice Paul Burns said he will give a judgement on Thursday morning and remanded Mr Hughes in custody until 15 May. Earlier this month, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson from Craigavon, County Armagh, in Northern Ireland, pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Sgt Kirwan told the High Court Robinson has claimed to British police he received £25,000 from Mr Hughes for his involvement in the people smuggling. In November, Robinson pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property. Robinson will be sentenced at a later date. Four other men will stand trial at the Old Bailey in connection with this investigation. Another man, 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, from Mayobridge, County Down, Northern Ireland, is appealing against his extradition from the Republic of Ireland to the UK to face charges related to the Essex lorry discovery. The charges include 39 charges of manslaughter, and a charge of conspiracy to traffic people, as well as conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. A further hearing will be held in Dublin on 7 May.","A man whose extradition is being sought by Essex Police over the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese nationals was the organiser of the criminal activity for financial gain, a court has heard."
"Miami Republican Frank Artiles reportedly insulted two black senators during a bar chat at the Governors Club in Tallahassee. Mr Artiles apologised for the incident on Wednesday, but the two lawmakers and critics called for his resignation. In a letter to the Senate president, Mr Artiles called himself a ""distraction"". ""My actions and my presence in government is now a distraction to my colleagues, the legislative process, and the citizens of our great State,"" he wrote to Senate President Joe Negron. ""I am responsible and I am accountable and effective immediately, I am resigning from the Florida State Senate."" ""It's clear there are consequences to every action, and in this area, I will need time for personal reflection and growth,"" he added. According to the Miami Herald, the incident began after 22:00 local time on Monday over drinks at the members-only club, located just steps from the State Capitol. A lawmaker approached Mr Artiles to ask if his objections to a bill she had filed were political payback for her questions about one of his previous bills. Mr Artiles reportedly used insults and profanity against African-American Senators Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville and Perry Thurston of Fort Lauderdale. He allegedly referred to Ms Gibson as a ""bitch"" and a ""girl"". According to witnesses, Mr Artiles also said Republican Senate President Joe Negron, who is white, owed his position to ""six [racial slur]"". It is unclear who he was referring to because the chamber's black senators are all Democrats, none of whom voted for Mr Negron. During Monday night's discussion, Mr Artiles reportedly sought to justify his use of the n-word, insisting he intended a slang pronunciation that he thought was not offensive. But Mr Negron ordered an investigation and forced Mr Artiles to apologise on Wednesday. Afterwards, Mr Artiles told reporters he would not resign and would ""file for 2018 and win my election"", the Miami Herald reported. On Thursday, Mr Artiles added he was stepping down to protect his family. ""While I take full responsibility for using language that was vulgar and inappropriate, my family has fallen victim to a political process that can distort the truth for the sole purpose of political gain,"" he said.",A Florida state senator has resigned amid backlash over reports that he used racial slurs over drinks with African-American colleagues.
"Jon SopelNorth America editor@bbcjonsopelon Twitter But after Sony's decision to can it (for now), I am now determined to watch - and buy tickets for all my friends too. But like any good drama, it has developed over three acts growing progressively more sinister as it goes along. There is a potential Act Four - more of which later. So readers, here's my synopsis so far. Act One: Life imitates art A hack - on Sony Pictures who were about to release a comedy caper about two journalists going to Pyongyang to assassinate the supreme leader Kim Jong-un. The finger of suspicion here in the US has been pointed firmly at North Korea. In a country not best known for its sense of humour (at least intentionally), news of this latest Hollywood production had sparked outrage. The cyber-attack is brilliantly effective and penetrates Sony's computer systems. It sounded like a ludicrous plotline from the movie itself. But no. It was reality. All of this happened. Act Two: Cringing interlude The hackers not only get inside, they get access to everyone's emails, and oh what fun the hackers had releasing them. Best were the emails sent between the studio boss Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin in which Mr Rudin describes the saintly Angelina Jolie as ""a minimally talented spoiled brat"". These two then had a conversation about meeting Barack Obama and what films would interest him. This exchange is so puerile that it is not worth quoting - suffice to say it was all about showing him movies that focused on black characters. The gossip columns have a field day and can't believe their luck that such a rich seam of tittle-tattle is laid out on a platter for them. Act Three: Freedom of speech And from comedy to something much more profound, and the decision last night by Sony to pull the film from its scheduled release on 25 December. This came after a chilling threat from the hacking group, ""Guardians of Peace"". ""We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview' be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to. Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made. The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)"" The president gave an interview in which he said there was no credible intelligence that such an attack was being planned - and he urged cinemagoers to keep going. But the cinema chains got cold feet, so did Sony and that was that. Which has led many to ask - whatever happened to freedom of speech, what happened to the First Amendment, what happened to Voltaire's 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'. Aaron Sorkin, the genius writer behind The West Wing, The Newsroom and much else besides said: ""Today the US succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie."" That quote from Mr Sorkin begs another question. After 9/11 people made a point of going to New York to show that they would not be intimidated by terrorists. In the Blitz during the Second World War, the-then Queen Elizabeth made a point of going to the East End after it was extensively bombed to show that she stood shoulder to shoulder with the people there, and refused to move her family from Buckingham Palace to the safety of the countryside, which she could have easily done. John F Kennedy stood with the people of Berlin during the Cold War and the period of the airlift to declare ""Ich bin ein Berliner'."" But today's cinema bosses, with well-groomed lawyers at their side, are fearful of litigation. They are responsible for the safety of people at their cinemas, and so they take the decision to not risk it. Act Four: Potentially the most serious consequence And here is the really deadly serious bit about all this. When does a cyber attack constitute an actual act of war? At the highest levels of government this is a question that is being asked. The former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has said the actions against Sony are an act of war and Mr Obama should be planning revenge against North Korea. And what if the next target for the cyber attackers is not a film corporation but an electricity grid, or gas suppliers, or water pumping stations? Then what? Call this a comedy? I'm not sure there is much to laugh about.","Having watched the trailer for The Interview, I'm going to say it's not a film I would normally rush to see."
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent If there is to be a new coalition government involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Greens and possibly some independents, it still seems weeks away. Negotiations between the three parties have been continuing. There is an expectation they may be able to agree a programme for government within two weeks. But the difficult and divisive issues, such as how to deal with the economic implications of repaying debts arising from the Covid-19 crisis, are being left till last. The three parties have a combined Dáil (lower house of parliament) vote of 84 - just four above a majority and many believe they will need to get the support of some independent TDs to have a more comfortable existence. That could further delay a coalition formation because the independents may have their own individual priority issues. If the parties do reach agreement on a programme for government they will then have to get the deal passed by their memberships. Although two cabinet ministers have voiced their opposition and concerns about coalition, Fine Gael, with its electoral college which gives a big say to the parliamentary party, is expected to meet the least resistance to the proposed government. Fianna Fáil, which has slumped in the polls since the election, is expected to post ballot papers to its estimated 15,000 members if there is a deal. Eamon Ó'Cuív, a former minister and grandson of the party's founder Eamon de Valera, is among those most opposed to going into government with the party's traditional enemy Fine Gael. Both parties have their origins in the conflicting sides of the Irish Civil War between 1922 and 1923. Many believe that the relatively elderly membership of the party may reject such a coalition. And then there are people, mainly in rural areas, in both parties who have deep concerns about the impact Green policies may have on them, road building and agriculture. The Greens have the highest membership threshold to cross to go into coalition; the party must get a two thirds majority for a deal. The party also has its opponents to going into government with the other two. And all the while, simmering in the background, there is a potential leadership challenge to party leader Eamon Ryan from the deputy leader Catherine Martin. Watching all of this unfold is Sinn Féin, the party which got the most votes in the February election 16 weeks ago. Mary Lou McDonald and her colleagues know they are almost certain to be the main opposition. But there remains the small, but very unlikely, possibility that if the current negotiations collapse there is a chance Sinn Féin may try to form a government with Fianna Fáil - probably under a new leader - and other left of centre parties and TDs. When the election results became known, the talk was of a government by Easter, then the middle of May, followed by mid-June and now the end of June and possibly the beginning of July for the election of a taoiseach (prime minister). In these mainly sunny Covid-19 times, the clouds of uncertainty still hang over the if and when of Irish coalition government formation.",It is well over 100 days since the Republic of Ireland's inconclusive general election.
"In the footage, the officer is seen striking a man who is pinned to the ground during an anti-government yellow vest (gilets jaunes) protest in Paris. The incident was captured by other protesters at Saturday's demonstration. Weekly yellow vest rallies have taken place across France since November 2018. Warning: An image below is of a graphic nature The movement, whose members wear distinctive yellow high-visibility jackets, accuses French President Emmanuel Macron of protecting the elite and ignoring the needs of ordinary citizens. Recent protests have been boosted by people demonstrating against a plan to overhaul France's pension system, which they say will force people to work longer or face reduced payouts when they retire. Demonstrations have often turned violent. About 60 people were arrested during the latest protest on Saturday following clashes with riot police. The footage of the officer punching a man who is on the floor and appears to have a bloodied face was widely shared on social media. The Paris prosecutors' office said on Sunday that an investigation was under way to determine whether ""intentional violence by a person in a position of public authority"" was committed. It added that the inquiry was being carried out by the police oversight body. The Paris police department said it had asked those leading the anti-riot operations to ""give a full account of this incident"". Previous rallies across France have also led to scuffles, with a number of injuries reported and allegations of police brutality. Mr Macron has warned that ""unacceptable behaviour"" by some officers could undermine the credibility of police departments. He has also condemned the use of violence by protesters. In November, police used tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to control crowds when thousands of demonstrators thronged the streets of Paris. With many clad in black and wearing masks to hide their faces, rioters in parts of the city burned barricades, vandalised banks, set rubbish bins on fire and hurled cobblestones at police. More than 100 people were arrested in some of the worst violence the city had seen since the protests began.",An investigation has been launched after a video showing a French police officer repeatedly punching a protester in the face was shared online.
"Mark MardellNorth America editor@BBCMarkMardellon Twitter Perhaps he's unused to sunlight, perhaps he's close to tears. Certainly he appears to be a man who barely dares to hope that freedom is but minutes away. Waiting for US special forces to land, he looks upwards towards their helicopter just for a few seconds, almost guiltily. His tension appears close to unbearable; perhaps he is unable to trust the evidence of his own eyes, suspecting some cruel joke. As the helicopter lands, American soldiers race toward their old enemy. The meeting of US forces and the Haqqani network - who've been trying to kill each other for 13 years - is extraordinary in itself. The commentator in Pashtun gloats that the handshakes were hurried, the soldiers seemed nervous and eager to get away. Certainly they don't waste any time getting back in the helicopter, complete with their human prize. There is no doubt at all that America's enemies - the people they have fought, and say are finished as a force - are using this swap to proclaim that they are far from beaten. David Sedney - Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia until recently - told me: ""The video is important in the context of the Taliban hailing the recent exchange as a victory for them. ""They are using it to try to counterbalance the victory the Afghan people won over them in the elections. The massive turnout was roundly trumpeted in the Afghan world as a victory over the Taliban,"" he added. ""They are now using this exchange as a validation - saying: 'Look how important we are, look how successful we are.' They will use it to strengthen their recruiting, strengthen their position because now they are looking at a major military offensive this summer to try to dent the confidence of the Afghan forces with a goal to try to take over the country in 2017 or 18."" There is no doubt that the Taliban are playing this for all it is worth. One expert on the Taliban, Rahimullah Yusufzai, was recently appointed to a team to negotiate with them in Pakistan. He told me ""the Taliban has never been so happy; they have been celebrating it. It's festive, sweets have been distributed, rice has been cooked for guests. ""It's something for which they were waiting for for years; it's finally happened,"" he added. ""They're saying it established them as a force to reckon with and that their status has been finally acknowledged."" While some see this as a disaster, he sees it as rather hopeful. ""In the past they've been demonised as terrorists, but then the Americans agreed to talk to them; they wanted a deal,"" he said. ""This is very positive because it should lead to more substantive peace talks, because everybody says there's no military solution in Afghanistan. If that is the case, it shows the way that there can be peace talks, there can be maybe reconciliation, some power sharing agreement."" US President Barack Obama seems dismissive of criticism, and says people attacked Washington, Lincoln and FDR in the same way. Wars end, he argues, with negotiations and prisoner exchanges. But the way the Taliban are using this swap is more than just a Washington media storm. It goes to the heart of what has been achieved in Afghanistan, and whether the people who the US fought for so long are not only still around, but are once again on the rise.","In the most striking moments of the long, triumphant Taliban video, Sgt Bowe Bergdahl blinks rapidly, looking rather dazed."
"By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi ""OMG: Deepika Padukone's cleavage show,"" the paper tweeted alongside a photo of her from an event last year. Thousands joined Bollywood celebrities in condemning the newspaper and praising Padukone for speaking out against the tweet. Her indignant reply - ""YES! I am a Woman. I have breasts AND a cleavage! You got a problem!!??"" - was re-tweeted more than 7,000 times. #IStandWithDeepikaPadukone has been India's top Twitter trend for hours and the actress is being lauded for taking on the Times of India. But she is just the latest Bollywood actress to clash with the media. Last October, India (and indeed the world) was transfixed by a video of Mallika Sherawat's heated exchange with a female reporter at a press conference where the actress refused to retract her statement that ""Indian society is regressive for women"". Sherawat was in India to launch her show The Bachelorette India when the reporter questioned whether Sherawat was right to criticise India in an interview with US magazine Vanity Fair by calling ""India regressive and depressing"". An angry Sherawat took on the reporter, saying she was ""not going to lie"" or ""join this hypocrisy that is there in our society"". ""With female foeticide, infanticide happening on an almost daily basis; with gang rapes making the headlines of almost every newspaper; with honour killings… I think it's a very, very regressive state for women. And I stand by it,"" she said. The YouTube video was shared extensively on Facebook and Twitter and the actress was congratulated for stating an inconvenient truth about the state of Indian women. Recently, actress Parineeti Chopra clashed with another reporter who asked her why ""when girls are young, they like 'it' and when they get old, they start shouting and screaming that the boy exploited them"". A visibly annoyed Chopra asked the reporter what he meant by ""it"". She carried on: ""We are forcing you to be with us? I'm sorry, that you're so tortured... I think this is ridiculous and disrespectful to say to a girl."" Her comments prompted applause from other journalists present at the press conference. This wasn't Chopra's only clash with the press - she is also reported to have taken on a male reporter who described menstruation as ""a problem"" and another who quizzed her on her weight - and some have dubbed her as Bollywood's Angry Young Girl. That title is an echo of a name given to Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan who was dubbed India's ""angry young man"" many years ago for challenging the patriarchal hierarchy in his on-screen roles in Bollywood hits like Deewar and Zanjeer. It is nothing new that actresses and celebrities around the world are regularly portrayed as mere body parts that need to live up to certain standards, with frequent commentary on the tightness of their abs and endless aspects of their grooming. Sections of the media have long seen celebrities as fair game with regular reports about Britney Spears piling on the pounds, Lindsay Lohan has variously been described as fat and frumpy or superskinny, for example. Sometimes the celebrity in question will lash out on Twitter, libellous material will attract lawsuits and at other times the celebrity will simply ignore the coverage, but we rarely hear about the stand-up rows between the media and celebrities that have been seen in India. So why is Bollywood protesting now, and with such intensity? In recent years, the spotlight has been on how India treats its women and the country's patriarchal system. The brutal gang-rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student on a bus in Delhi in December 2012 was a game-changer in a society where women are often treated as second-class citizens and have long been exploited. That has led to far more coverage of the treatment of women in India's booming media and social media. And when the media is accused of propagating the patriarchy there is far more intense scrutiny. ""The way actresses and celebrities are portrayed in the media is completely horrendous,"" says woman's rights activist Kavita Krishnan. ""There is always emphasis on their 'sexiness', their body, but Deepika Padukone is not just her cleavage."" Ms Krishnan says The Times of India inviting the viewers to ""come and stare at her boobs"" is an ""open invitation to harassment"". After Padukone lashed out at the Times and hundreds of tweets criticised it for being sexist and voyeuristic, the daily removed the report from its site and urged the actress to ""consider it a compliment"". This defence, critics said, was worse than the original offence. ""This is sex harassment being passed off as a compliment,"" Ms Krishnan said. ""This is exactly what men on the street say, if you object to their behaviour, they say it's a compliment. ""This is what louts do. How can a national newspaper do this?""",India's leading newspaper The Times of India has been fiercely criticised after it published a photo and tweet about actress Deepika Padukone's cleavage. But Padukone is not the first Bollywood star to clash with the media recently.
"He was arrested on suspicion of organising an unofficial protest in Paris, after he encouraging people to gather and lay candles near the Champs-Elysées for those who had died during months of protests. The demonstration was aimed at ""shocking public opinion"", as he put it. His swift arrest prompted one political leader to label the protest leader's detention an ""abuse of power"" by the government. By Thursday afternoon he was free again. ""Everything that happens here is political,"" he told reporters after his release. ""We have been questioned at least four or five times on the same topics."" How did Eric Drouet become a leader? Mr Drouet is a lorry driver by trade, and rose to prominence online during the emergence of the gilets jaunes or ""yellow vests"" movement in October and November 2018. The movement focused initially on the rising cost of fuel, and was named after the high-visibility vests required by law by every motorist in the country. Mr Drouet, 33, is credited with suggesting that angry drivers deliberately block or slow traffic in their area on 17 November, causing enough disruption to attract the government's attention. After some 300,000 people took part in the first wave of weekend protests on that day, the movement spiralled. It was followed by weeks of similar large-scale protests across France. Mr Drouet was frequently cited as one of the figureheads of a movement that was largely decentralised and lacked any formal leadership. He acted, alongside several others, as a kind of spokesman for the protesters, rallying support on Facebook and appearing on television. Then came his first arrest on 22 December, during the sixth wave of protests. Deputy interior minister Laurent Nuñez said that Mr Drouet had organised an undeclared demonstration and had changed the planned venue. He was charged with carrying a weapon in the form of a baton and for taking part in a group formed with intent to commit violence. His lawyer said the ""baton"" was just a piece of wood that was in his bag - and argued the arrest was politically motivated and aimed at discrediting him. He is facing trial for his first arrest in June. He was detained again on 2 January, suspected of organising another undeclared protest, after going on social media with a call for ""action"". This time, a few dozen people took part and no yellow vests were involved. After his arrest, Mr Drouet's lawyer told the BBC that his client had not taken part in any demonstration, but was simply meeting friends in central Paris. He was simply a participant, not the organiser, his lawyer said. Is this a clampdown on protests? The number of protesters turning out in Paris each weekend has gradually declined. After making a raft of small economic concessions last month, President Emmanuel Macron struck a defiant tone in his new year address to the nation, saying the government would push on with its reform programme, and would ""make no allowances in guaranteeing public order."" Mr Drouet's latest arrest has led to an outpouring of support from members of the gilets jaunes movement and also political opponents of the French president on the left and right. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a left-wing leader and former presidential candidate, wondered why he had been arrested again and suggested that it was ""abuse of power"". He accused a ""politicised"" police of harassing the leaders of the yellow-vest movement. ""Enough violence, convictions, and arrests against the yellow vests! Free Eric Drouet,"" he tweeted. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party also expressed support for Mr Drouet. Referring to Mr Macron's defiant new year speech, she tweeted: ""His aggressive 31 December wishes and systematic violation of his opponents' political rights paint a terribly disturbing picture of Emmanuel Macron."" As well as guaranteeing public order, Mr Macron criticised unnamed individuals claiming to speak for the French people. He said they were ""the mouth-pieces of a hate-filled crowd who target elected representatives, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners and homosexuals.""","Eric Drouet, one of the leading public figures in France's yellow vests protests, was arrested for a second time late on Wednesday, prompting claims of police harassment."
"By Yvette TanBBC News It's been more than a week since the Diamond Princess went into lockdown, after a previous passenger tested positive for the virus after disembarking. With almost 500 out of 3,700 people on board tested, 174 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. Those still on board are in quarantine for another week. But it's not just the Diamond Princess. On another cruise ship in Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers people were quarantined because of fears that people on board might have the virus. They were only allowed to disembark after tests came back negative. And a cruise ship carrying more than 1,450 passengers, which left Hong Kong on 1 February, was turned away from ports in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, despite having no infections on board. It has now been told it can dock in Cambodia. Cruise ships have for years been referred to as ""floating Petri dishes"" - places ripe for the exchange of germs, and the spreading of illness. But is the accusation true? Do viruses spread more easily on cruise ships? There is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on ships, says Prof Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases specialist at the Australian National University. ""In general, you've got passengers and crew members from different parts of the world mixing intimately and intensely for a short period of time,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""They've all got varying levels of immunity and so that does set things up for an infection outbreak."" With coronavirus, which is believed to spread through droplets - such as from mucus or saliva - people could be infected without direct contact with a carrier. ""Say if someone sneezed on to a table, and then someone else immediately touches that table, that could lead to infection,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""People might not all be talking to each other - but they are in shared spaces like swimming pools, spas, dining rooms and auditoriums."" However, Stewart Chiron, a cruise expert, says ""the reality onboard a cruise is very different to the perception of it"". ""So for example, people think that when you're queuing up at buffet lines that there's a lot of interaction and contact between passengers,"" says Mr Chiron, who has been on board more than 250 cruise ships. ""For the major cruise lines, that's not true. There are stations - if you want eggs you go to the egg station, a gloved crew member will do that for you. ""The point is that you're rarely waiting in a line, and not everyone passes by every piece of food - what that does is minimise the interaction between people."" But what about crew members? If passenger interaction is minimised, crew interaction is another story. On the Diamond Princess, at least 10 crew members are among the infected. According to the New York Times, more than 1,000 crew members ""live and work elbow-to-elbow"". ""It's likely crew members will be in very close contact with each other, perhaps even sharing facilities,"" says Dr Senanayake. ""People will disembark the ship but the crew members often may not change. So if there is ongoing transmission from the crew, when the next set of passengers come on that may continue."" How are the risks mitigated? According to Mr Chiron, cruises have extremely stringent cleaning and screening processes. ""Cruises are always taking thorough readings of passengers. If you look ill then you are subject to a secondary medical screening."" Probably the disease most associated with cruise ships is norovirus, a vomiting illness caught via contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. ""Cruises have various protocols that are enabled when a norovirus case is reported,"" says Mr Chiron. ""There's extensive scrubbing that goes on, all the surfaces are continuously cleaned. During the buffets there will be no food like bread baskets. The crew are specially trained for this."" He adds that things have become more stringent since the outbreak of the coronavirus. ""You can tell now they're much more observant of passengers' appearances. If you look at how well ships are cleaned and maintained - they are extremely thorough."" According to Dr Senanayake, there is an official Vessel Sanitation Program at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that advises ships on how to prevent and control the spread of illnesses. ""I believe cruise ships now have got a lot of disinfection stations, and are also advising patients or crew members who are sick not to come on board,"" he says. ""There is that risk of going on a cruise ship but everything in life comes with risks. [People just have to] practice simple [precautionary] measures."" For the Diamond Princess, Dr Senanayake says the ship is employing ""good isolation measures"" by keeping people in their rooms (passengers are allowed onto the outdoor decks at certain times). However, he adds: ""[The ship] needs to make sure people understand why this is happening and understand their concerns. ""You've gone from having the time of your life to being isolated in your room feeling very scared. The quarantine should always be done in a very humane and compassionate way."" Is the industry suffering? The cruise industry will definitely take a ""financial hit"" - but these cases aren't going to stop people from taking cruises, says Mr Chiron. ""The damage they're going to take specifically is from the cruises around China and South East Asia. The lines themselves are cancelling routes. ""Cruise Norwegian, for example, are cancelling all their Asia sailings. They are going to have to issue refunds, credits - we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. ""But when you look at the rest of the world, Europe, Alaska, the US - people are still travelling. Royal Caribbean revealed that just 1.5% of enquiries they received were about people asking the virus. ""People are concerned, yes, but they are still travelling. Elsewhere in the world the ships are full and they are going to continue to be full."" Read more about the coronavirus and its impact SHOULD WE WORRY?

"By Christina McSorleyBBC News NI The zootoca vivipara, or common lizard, is a protected species in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. A member of the public discovered the spider alongside the small, dead lizard in her garden in County Dublin. It was was half covered in the false widow's silk, and the spider was seemingly feeding on it. Michel Dugon, a zoologist at the Ryan Institute at NUI Galway, said the lizard was ""completely mummified"". ""What we found is that the lizard was completely wrapped in the way a spider would wrap its prey. ""The lizard measured 8.5cm and weighed 0.4 grams. There was nothing left in it except the skin and the bones. The spider just fed on the flesh."" ""This spider was feeding at the neck of the lizard. Spiders bite their prey around the neck for the venom to reach the central nervous system. Gruesome process ""What a spider does is external digestion, it is quite gruesome but very interesting. ""A spider first injects venom with its fangs, then uses the fangs to make a puncture in the skin of the prey and then discharge the content of its stomach into the prey and once all the organs are turned into a kind of broth, she will suck that back up. ""This is how you end up with a completely mummified lizard."" The venomous false widow spider arrived on the island of Ireland 20 years ago and went largely unnoticed, Mr Dugon said. Although the unusual event took place in May 2017, researchers from the Ryan Institute at NUI Galway and the Herpetological Society of Ireland have just published their report into it. Lizards normally eat spiders, so to find a spider eating a lizard is unusual in itself. ""It is the first time we recorded a bug feeding on a vertebrate in on the island of Ireland,"" Mr Dugon explained. He said it also shows the unintended consequence of an alien species successfully overcoming a native lizard. ""It's an excellent example of how an invasive species can go under the radar for 20 years, and when we start it notice it, it is probably too late"". False widow facts: •False widow spiders arrived in south-west England in the 1870s •It is Britain's most venomous spider, although there are no reported deaths from its bite in the UK •The spider has distinctive cream markings on its bulbous body and is brown with reddish-orangey legs •It eats insects, invertebrates and even other spiders •It prefers warm, dark places •The UK has about 650 species of spider and of these only about a dozen are capable of biting humans Source: Natural History Museum 'Not as deadly as a bee' The Herpetological Society of Ireland said it wants people to contact it if they come across lizard carcasses. Co-author of the report, Rob Gandola, said the presence of a false widow isn't the biggest challenge to Irish lizards. ""Rapid urbanisation, houses being built in previously rural areas pose the biggest threat to the survival of the common lizard"". We also shouldn't worry too much about false widow spiders as, Mr Dugon explained, though a bite can be uncomfortable, it is not fatal. ""If you get bit by a false widow you could experience a range of symptoms ranging from swelling, inflammation of the blood vessels, feeling nauseous, all in all it's not fun and as far as we know it's not fatal. ""Every year in the UK approximately five-to-seven people die from bee stings, however most people don't see bees as being deadly creatures. ""Overall a bee is far more deadly than a false widow,"" he added.",For the first time a false widow spider has been recorded feeding on Ireland's only native lizard.
"It says four rebel soldiers were killed and six injured. Russian-backed rebels say Ukrainian forces tried to break through their lines and got caught in a minefield, with two killed and three wounded. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the rebel ""provocation"" would not derail Kyiv's course to achieve peace. The violence puts new pressure on a shaky ceasefire deal. Tuesday's clash, now said to be over, took place near Zolote, a front-line village in the Luhansk region of Donbas. The conflict began in 2014, and the rebels control large swathes of the region, including the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. A framework ceasefire deal was agreed in February 2015 - the Minsk agreement - but was soon violated as fighting resumed. The Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation (JFO) HQ, commanding government troops in Donbas, said its positions were shelled heavily at several points around Zolote on Tuesday - Novotoshkivske, Orikhove, Krymske and Khutir Vilny. ""The occupiers are firing on our defenders using weapons banned under the Minsk [ceasefire] agreements. The enemy is using 120mm mortars and firing various grenade launchers and heavy machine-guns. Under the cover of firing, the Russian occupiers have switched to offensive actions and have tried to cross the contact line,"" the JFO statement said. A local official, Vitaliy Shvedov, said the intense shelling was similar to the peak of fighting in 2015. The JFO said its forces had not lost ground to the rebels who, it said, had requested a ceasefire. The chief of Ukraine's general staff, Ruslan Khomchak, said at a briefing later on Tuesday that four enemy soldiers were killed and six injured. In recent months there has been cautious progress towards a peace settlement: there were significant prisoner exchanges and talks between Mr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, mediated by France and Germany. After a meeting of Ukraine's security council, President Zelensky called Tuesday's flare-up ""an attempt to wreck the peace process in Donbas, which had started to move forward with small but continuous steps"". Meanwhile, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LNR), Leonid Pasechnik, said Ukrainian soldiers had tried - but failed - to infiltrate the rebel-held territory. He said two Ukrainian service personnel had been killed and three injured as they tried to get closer to LNR positions. More than 13,000 people have died in the conflict, which dates back to April 2014, when the separatist rebels seized key areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The rebels have Russian heavy weapons, and Western experts say Russian regular units have bolstered their ranks. The Kremlin denies that, while admitting that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. The conflict in Donbas erupted after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in March 2014.","Ukraine says its troops on the eastern front line have come under heavy shelling during a rebel attack, with one soldier killed and four wounded."
"They posted videos online, shared pictures and dramatic stories from inside the quarantined city that has been virtually cut off from the rest of the country. Now, they are nowhere to be found. Fang Bin and Chen Qiushi were both determined to share what they could about the crisis, reporting from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, and sending what they found out into the world. As a result, they racked up thousands of views on their videos. But their channels have now gone quiet, and those who followed them online fear they may have disappeared for good. What do we know about Fang Bin? Wuhan businessman Fang Bin began posting videos about the outbreak to ""report on the actual situation here"", promising to ""do his best"" in the reporting. He uploaded his first video on 25 January to YouTube, which is banned in China but accessible through virtual private networks (VPN). His first few videos - mostly featuring him driving around the city and showing the situation in different places - managed slightly more than 1,000 views. Then on 1 February he filmed a video which got people to sit up and take notice. The clip, which has been viewed almost 200,000 times, appears to show eight corpses piled in a minibus outside a hospital in Wuhan. Fang alleges that police barged into his home on that same night and interrogated him about his videos. He was taken away, warned, but eventually released. But on 9 February, he posted a 13-second video with the words ""all people revolt - hand the power of the government back to the people"". After that, the account went silent. What do we know about Chen Qiushi? Chen, a former human rights lawyer turned video journalist, was already relatively well known in the activist space. He built his reputation through his coverage of the Hong Kong protests last August. That coverage, he later alleged, led to him being harassed and ultimately muzzled by Chinese authorities following his return to the mainland. His Chinese social media accounts, which reportedly had a following of more than 700,000, were deleted. But he could not be kept quiet. In October, he created a YouTube account which now has some 400,000 subscribers. He also has over 265,000 followers on Twitter. In late January he decided to travel to Wuhan to report on the worsening situation. ""I will use my camera to document what is really happening. I promise I won't… cover up the truth,"" he said in his first YouTube video. He visited different hospitals in Wuhan, looking at the conditions and speaking to patients. Chen knew that this was putting him at risk. He told the BBC's John Sudworth earlier this month that he was unsure how long he would be able to continue. ""The censorship is very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content,"" he said. Then, on 7 February, a video was shared on his Twitter account - which is currently managed by a friend - featuring his mother, who said he had gone missing the day before. His friend Xu Xiaodong later alleged in a YouTube video that he had been forcibly quarantined. What have authorities said? Chinese authorities have remained tight-lipped on the issue. There has been no official statement detailing where Fang Bin or Chen Qiushi are, or when they are likely to emerge if they have been put into quarantine. Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International, said it was still unclear whether Chen or Fang ""were taken away by police or placed under 'forced quarantine'"". However, he added that authorities should ""at least"" ensure family members were contacted. ""Chinese authorities should inform their families and give them access to a lawyer of their choice. Otherwise, it's a legitimate concern that they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment,"" Mr Poon told the BBC. Why might they have disappeared? Beijing is known for clamping down on activists who speak out. It has also been keen to show it is getting the outbreak under control. It is perhaps not surprising that, according to one Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, the authorities are currently ""equally, if not more, concerned with silencing criticism as with containing the spread of the virus"". One doctor, Li Wenliang, was warned not to spread ""false comments"" after raising the alarm about the virus earlier in December. He eventually caught the virus and died. His death triggered an unprecedented wave of anger, sparking an online uprising. Chinese authorities were stunned, and reacted by attempting to censor every critical comment about Dr Li's death. ""The authoritarian Chinese government has a history of harassing and detaining citizens for speaking the truth or for criticizing the authorities during public emergencies, for example, during Sars in 2003, Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, Wenzhou train crash in 2011 and Tianjin chemical explosion in 2015,"" HRW's Yaqiu Wang told the BBC. However, she says China needs to ""learn from experience and understand that freedom of information, transparency and the respect for human rights facilitate disease control, not hinder it"". ""Authorities are doing themselves a disservice by [allegedly] disappearing Fang and Chen,"" she added. On Chinese news site Weibo, there are only a handful of comments mentioning Chen and Fang - and it seems only a matter of time before they are scrubbed away by China's ever vigilant censors. ""[They] re-write history,"" said one comment. ""Slowly it will be like [there never was] someone called Chen Qiushi.""","They are citizen journalists, wanting to provide the ""truth"" of what is happening in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China."
"Proposing a toast at the end of a successful meeting is not an unusual practice in many parts of the world. A handshake suffices for most people. For others it may involve knocking back a glass of the local hooch. In Chin state, those attending a village meeting on agricultural development are invited to take a hit of opium. A rusty tobacco tin is passed round as village elders, farmers and even the staff of a local non-government organisation (NGO) use a toothpick to scoop up a tiny dark, gooey pellet of raw opium - and swallow. Scattered on the slope of a mountain, Mualpi is a village of 175 households overlooking the Manipur river in north-western Myanmar, also known as Burma. Small-scale opium cultivation has existed here for a long time. About half of the families in the village are involved in opium farming. The surrounding mountaintops are dotted with light green patches of poppy fields. It's been used as a medicine to treat diarrhoea, dysentery and other ailments. But over the last decade commercial poppy production has taken hold. Since 2006 opium production has nearly tripled in Myanmar. Growing trade The opium is refined into heroin inside the country and then exported to its neighbours. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (Undoc) estimates the market value of last year's total production to be around $340m (£220m). As a result Myanmar can now lay claim to the dubious honour, after Afghanistan, of being the second largest producer of opium in the world. It now accounts for almost 25% of the world's total production. Right up until the end of the 20th century, the mountains of Myanmar, which was part of the so-called ""Golden Triangle"" with neighbouring Laos and Thailand, was the largest supplier of opium. The region was then overtaken by Afghanistan. Demand from China, but also Australia and Japan, is one factor behind the rise in production in Myanmar over the last decade. The single biggest driver in this turnaround is the growth of demand in China where Undoc estimates that 70% of the heroin produced in Asia is consumed by more than a million users. Another part of the puzzle is poverty. Ranked 150 out of 187 countries in the UN's Human Development Report, Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Poverty is particularly grinding in rural areas, with insufficient investment in infrastructure and an underdeveloped agriculture sector. ""Farmers see opium cultivation as a way to secure their income and provide for the family,"" says Tom Kramer from the Transnational Institute, a Dutch organisation that has reported on the production and trade of drugs in south-east Asia. ""It's also a very useful medicine in areas with limited access to healthcare and other medicines."" At the village meeting in Mualpi, several farmers said they grew opium. One of them, a man in his late 40s wearing a creased cap and a cheerful grin, says that for most people growing poppy is not a choice, but a necessity. ""We do it to survive,"" he insists. ""The income you get from growing maize or vegetables is very low, and can't compare with opium."" Indeed, growing opium can reward farmers handsomely for relatively little work. The season is short - only four months from planting to harvest - and it's easy to transport the product. Buyers will travel to opium-growing communities to buy the drugs, while farmers must transport maize or other agricultural products to the market to turn a profit. ""Some buyers will even provide the capital up front for farmers to cultivate the opium,"" adds Mr Kramer. But this lucrative business is not without risk. As opium is cheap and readily available in the communities that grow it, addiction has become an issue. Two hours south of Mualpi, in Tonzang, pastor Philip Suang Kho Thang has come to collect a building permit for a rehabilitation clinic for opium users. ""There is no help available,"" the pastor says, as his trembling hands hold up photographs of seemingly unconscious and intoxicated youngsters. ""It's sad to see how the youth is dragged down into this,"" he adds. ""Old people suffer too, as their children stop providing for them and instead just smoke opium all day."" A carpenter in Tonzang, who used to grow opium, says he stopped because he was worried his children would get hooked. ""I still miss having all that money, especially when someone in our family gets sick or when the kids want a new toy,"" he says. ""But at least I don't have to worry about my children getting addicted any more."" While demand and poverty fuels the business, conflict and a corrupt and weak state makes it all possible. Opium is cultivated in remote mountainous areas, where long-term conflict between ethnic rebels and government forces has made law enforcement difficult. Furthermore, all sides - the army, rebels and militias - each take a poppy tax from the farmers, so have little incentive to end the activity. Mr Kramer argues that eradication programmes don't work. ""There is no evidence that eradication actually reduces cultivation on a larger scale,"" he says. ""Globally, opium cultivation levels have only increased in the last 30 or 40 years despite massive efforts of eradication. ""It does however have many negative effects. It feeds corruption and hurts poor communities that are deprived of their main source of income."" After the high, the downer As cultivation for this season's crop gets under way, further pressure on incomes is already being felt. At a meeting last week of researchers and opium farmers from across the country, growers said that falling prices and higher labour costs on top of more aggressive ""tax"" collection has made the business less profitable. The recent floods and landslides in regions like Chin state have further worsened the outlook. After failing to meet its own deadline of eradicating poppy production by this year, the government in Myanmar's capital city Naypyidaw has extended it to 2019. However, observers say, this pledge is as doomed as the last one. With few other sources of income available the farmers' options are very limited. The opium farmer in Mualpi says it would make the villagers' lives worse if the police managed to destroy their poppies. ""What will we live off then? We would all be in debt and simply have to grow more opium next year to make up for the loss,"" he said.","By the end of this year Myanmar should have been free of narcotics. Instead, production of opium is soaring and the East Asian country, once part of the fabled Golden Triangle, is the second largest producer in the world. Axel Kronholm investigates why."
"The air strikes on Daglica were in response to PKK shelling of a military outpost, the armed forces said. Both sides have been observing a truce and it is the first major air raid on the PKK since March 2013. Kurds are furious at Turkey's inaction as Islamic State (IS) militants attack the Syrian border town of Kobane. Fighters from the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) have been aiding Kurdish YPG militia in Kobane and Turkey has refused to help supply its long-standing enemy with weapons or allow Kurdish fighters to enter Syria. Two PKK commanders wounded in fighting were arrested by Turkish authorities when they arrived for treatment in hospital in south-eastern Turkey, Anatolia news agency reported. Separately, some 260 YPG militiamen were arrested when they crossed into Turkey last week, although 60 of them were allowed to go back, Turkish media reported. French President Francois Hollande appealed to the government in Ankara on Tuesday to open its border, as US-led fighter jets continued to target IS fighters in and around Kobane. The air raids on PKK positions near the south-eastern village of Daglica on Monday caused ""heavy casualties"", Hurriyet daily reported. The strikes followed a three-day PKK assault on a military outpost with heavy machine guns and rocket launchers, it said. Clashes were also reported between the PKK and troops in the Tunceli area of east-central Turkey on Monday, far from the border. Last week Kurdish protests gripped Turkey's Kurdish-majority south-eastern provinces. At least 31 people died in widespread street clashes, as Kurds vented their anger at Turkey's passive policy over Kobane. The army imposed a curfew in some areas. But some of the fighting was reported to be between PKK supporters and Islamist Kurds sympathetic to IS. Heavy fighting has been raging in Kobane since mid-September, as Syrian Kurds battle to defend the town against better-armed IS militants. Turkey treats the PKK as a ""terrorist"" organisation and its leader Abdullah Ocalan is in jail. But he has been Turkey's main point of contact in peace negotiations since he was incarcerated in 2012. The PKK - also labelled ""terrorist"" by Western governments - has been waging a 30-year insurgency for self-rule in eastern Turkey. The unrest has killed more than 40,000 people.","Turkish F-16 and F-4 warplanes have bombed Kurdish PKK rebel targets near the Iraqi border, as their ceasefire comes under increasing strain."
"By Pascal FletcherBBC Monitoring, Miami Why the plans for a new constitution? The proposed 224-article new constitution will replace the 1976 national charter that enshrined one-party communism on the island following Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. Acknowledging that Cuba and the world had changed since 1976, newly-elected Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the new realities meant the constitution was ""obliged"" to be updated, and he called the reform ""deep"". Mr Díaz-Canel, who took over from Fidel Castro's brother Raúl on 19 April - the first time for decades Cuba's head of state has not carried the name Castro - said the new document would reflect ""the now and the future of the nation"". Proposed changes that recognise same-sex marriage, but drop a previously stated objective of constructing a ""communist society"" in Cuba, have drawn intense media attention. However, the Caribbean nation definitely will be keeping its one-party socialist political and economic system, ruled over by the Communist Party of Cuba. While it has already been approved ""unanimously"" by the 600-plus assembly deputies, Cuban officials said the document would be subjected to a process of ""popular consultation"" among the island's people, to gather comments and suggestions, before being submitted for final approval in a national referendum. In: Marriage 'between two persons' One alteration that attracted comment both inside and outside the island was the proposal to redefine the institution of marriage as being between ""two persons"" rather than ""a man and a woman"" - a change effectively opening the way for the legalisation of same-sex marriages. This was undoubtedly a novelty in a country where the communist authorities - in the name of ""revolutionary morality"" - had persecuted homosexuals as ""scum"" in the first few decades following the 1959 revolution, often dispatching them to work camps along with priests and other ""anti-social"" elements. Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc after 1989 which pushed Cuba to open up more to the outside world, official attitudes to both religion and homosexuality have eased. In the 21-22 July debate by the National Assembly on the revised constitution, Cuban media made a point of highlighting the support for the marriage re-definition expressed by ""deputy Mariela Castro"" - the 55-year-old daughter of Cuban Communist Party leader and former president Raúl Castro. Mariela Castro, who is the director of the Cuban National Centre for Sex Education (CENESEX), has gained prominence as a defender of LGBT rights. In: Role of the market While reaffirming the overriding principles of a ""socialist"" economy and central economic planning, the proposed new charter gives formal juridical recognition to the ""the role of the market"", and ""private property"" as one of a range of types of property existing in the Cuban economy. The ""market"" and ""private ownership"" are both key elements of Western capitalism which were long pilloried as corrupting generators of inequality by Cuba's Communist Party rulers. So the changes reflect the realities of Cuba's own experience, which saw the island forced to open itself up more to foreign tourism and investment after the disappearance of its Soviet benefactor, including allowing of private self-employed economic activities and enterprises for which more than half a million Cubans currently have licences. Observers saw the constitutional tweaks moving Cuba in the direction of - but still far from close to - the types of ""market socialism"" currently practised by political allies like China and Vietnam. However, unlike those countries, Cuban officials and state media were still expressing public aversion to the idea of excessive individual enrichment, and the revised constitution continues to prohibit private ""concentration of property"". In: Prime minister and governors The constitutional reform introduces proposed novelties in the organisation and hierarchy of the Cuban state. One is the creation of the post of prime minister, to lead the Council of Ministers (cabinet) in the day-to-day running of the country. This prime minister would be designated by the National Assembly at the proposal of the president. This reinstates a position that had existed in the early years of the Cuban revolution. Another change is a proposal to have governors ruling Cuba's 15 provinces - instead of the current presidents of provincial assemblies - but the new constitutional text also stresses the importance of ""municipal autonomy"". Out: Aiming for a 'communist society' The elimination of the phrase ""to advance towards communist society"" has generated the most attention and comment. The revised article retains the goal of ""the construction of socialism"". Some media jumped on this change. ""Cuba renounces communism,"" was the excited headline carried by Cuban dissident website CiberCuba on 21 July. Even inside Cuba, the proposed alteration has produced debate, for example, on the curated readers' comments section of the official Communist Youth daily Juventud Rebelde on 22 July. Reader ""Juan R Oro"" wrote: ""The majority of us Cubans are not in agreement with this project of a constitution nor with the fact that the word communism is eliminated from this."" Another reader, ""El Oriental"" (The Easterner) had a different view: ""Jose del Oro, if communism has been a failure in Europe and what it does is keep investors away, why keep insisting on an obsolete and demonstrably failed system which does not evolve, it simply disappears."" Staying: Communist Party of Cuba and single-party system Cuban leaders and official media made very clear however the island was not giving up its one-party socialist system, or the pre-dominance of the ruling Communist Party, specifically defined as ""Fidelist"" and ""Marxist-Leninist"". Communist Party daily Granma declared on 23 July: ""The [constitution] project reaffirms the socialist character of our political, economic and socialist system, as well as the directing role of the Communist Party of Cuba."" In comments carried on state TV, Cuban National Assembly President Esteban Lazo assured viewers that ""the ideology"" was not being ""lost"" but updated to aim for ""sovereign, independent, democratic, prosperous and sustainable socialism"". Many Cuban exiles and anti-government dissidents were unimpressed by the proposed constitutional changes. In an apparently mocking reference to the continuation of the one-party state, Cuban dissident website 14yMedio carried a 22 July commentary headlined: ""There will be no transition in Cuba... not even to communism"". Some exile commentators were asking whether the alterations meant Cuba's schoolchildren, who start each day with a salute and the words ""Pioneers for communism! We will be like Che [Guevara]!"" would be changing their slogan now.","A draft of an updated constitution for Cuba approved by the island's National Assembly on 22 July has made headlines as much for what was left out as what was put in. Here are highlights of what's in, what's out and what's staying in the proposed new Cuban constitution."
"The organisers of the parade have decided to change the way the floats enter the arena in accordance with a similar event in France. It means crowds will be able to see the exhibits along the parade route first before they move around the arena. Battle exhibitor Steve Bouchard from the Optimists says it is a bad idea. He said: ""If we get this long it could affect Battle for years. I can't understand why we would want to ruin the spectacle of Battle. ""You wouldn't go to the theatre and then stand around for hours watching the stage crew putting the stage together and the cast milling around getting dressed. ""You want the spectacle of watching the curtain go up and we are going to lose that. The paying public don't want to sit there watching dancers asleep on the ground watching a single float for an hour."" Tony Perkins from the Battle of Flowers committee said one of the changes was to allow people to see the floats more quickly. He said they were also considering moving the festival to Friday and Saturday night instead of the current Thursday and Friday. Battle of Flowers is on Thursday 8 August with the Moonlight Parade the following day.",Floats at Jersey's annual Battle of Flowers will start lined up along the parade route instead of coming in from the west for the first time.
"""I'm the only survivor who actually saw the grenade,"" says Ngallos, who was on keyboards at the time looking out at the excited crowd packed into the small bar to see his band, Nouvelles Écritures. It came flying through the air towards him, hit the speakers and bounced. ""When it rolled off the stage, it fell into a little hole. That's what saved me. I was hurt, but alive."" Muslims and Christians dancing together That was 11 November 2017 - a perfect Saturday night for a party in the capital, Bangui - which unlike the rest of the country had not witnessed serious violence for more than a year. The air had been thick with anticipation. Band leader Ozaguin, one of the country's most popular musicians, was making a rare appearance in the volatile PK5 neighbourhood, notorious for numerous outbreaks of inter-religious violence between militia groups. Muslims and Christians from different neighbourhoods had been dancing together in the bar, a rare sight. Ngallos was lucky to survive the explosion, which killed four people and injured more than 20 others. It is still not clear who was behind the grenade attack but rumours spread like wildfire, triggering reprisal attacks. 'Condolences can't raise the dead' Several Muslim people were killed in retaliation, including a teenager who was dragged off his motorcycle by an angry mob. The interior minister later said the attackers had probably wanted to whip up tensions between communities. Ngallos, meanwhile, lay in his hospital bed consumed with horror by the unfolding events. ""I had expected a party and a good time, but it turned into the opposite,"" he said at the time. ""That's how terrorists work - they replace joy with sadness."" As chaos raged in the capital, Ngallos had a series of important visitors including the interior minister, the European Union ambassador plus a senior official from the UN's peacekeeping force in CAR, Minusca. But these visits just made him angry. Like many Central Africans, Ngallos blames the authorities for letting the conflict drag on. ""The government just comes to give their condolences,"" he says now, looking back. ""Condolences don't bring people back to life."" Shrapnel wounds in his chest, stomach and back as well as the lacerations on his legs confined him to hospital for days on end. To pass the slow, painful hours in between surgery he began dreaming up songs with messages about peace. Whispering melodies to himself, he would improvise lyrics as he went along. ""A lot of blood has spilled in our beautiful country,"" he would quietly sing to himself, ""we want peace."" 'The man who came back to life' As the days passed, calm slowly returned to the capital. The streets bustled with market stalls, motorcycle taxis and pedestrians again. On a hot, sunny Thursday a week after the grenade attack, the horror seemed far away. That day there was a party atmosphere in central Bangui where people gathered for a beer festival, talking and drinking. Ngallos' band members prepared to go on stage for the first time since the attack. Roots of a conflict: Read more: Central African Republic profile Although Ngallos was too weak to play, as he was still using crutches just a few days after leaving hospital, he could not resist going along to watch. A steady stream of friends and musicians greeted him with hugs and slaps on the back, calling him ""le ressuscité"" - the man who had come back to life. Ngallos believes this whole experience was part of his fate. ""Nothing happens by chance,"" he says. ""I have no hate for the Muslim community or anyone else. God knew something like this would happen and I would experience a shock."" 'Our choice and passion' Seven months after November's grenade attack, the Nouvelles Écritures set off on a peace tour of 14 different cities in CAR. A UN-backed initiative to bring rival communities together - each performance has taken place under the watchful eye of by peacekeepers. One of the band's newest songs, called Carrefour de la Paix after the name of the bar where the grenade attack happened, tells the story of the ordeal. Translated from the original Sango, the lyrics include: ""I gathered my musicians and we went to play. There was a good vibe, the people there could really dance. ""Suddenly, I heard a noise. I thought the fuse box had blown. When I turned around, I saw everyone was on the ground. The plastic chairs were broken. That day, I cried so much. I thought, it is my fault that the people there were injured and lost their lives."" Ngallos says it was important to commit those difficult memories to song. ""Even after I was injured in the grenade blast, we didn't want to stop making music. ""It's our career, our choice, our passion. We'd rather be martyrs for peace in the Central African Republic than stop,"" he adds. The trauma is something Ngallos is trying to come to terms with. Find out more about CAR: ""Whenever someone hits something or slams a door, I hear the sound of the grenade in my head. ""At night, I can't sleep. When I close my eyes it's like I'm watching a movie of what happened."" The CAR is still locked in conflict, with 14 active armed groups fighting over land and resources. The band had to cancel a scheduled appearance in the town of Bambari when clashes broke out there just hours ahead of the show. The second half of the tour was meant to take place this summer but was suspended after a new outbreak of fighting across the country. Ngallos says that despite everything he still thinks there is hope for peace. In the meantime he'll keep playing. And, one day, he vows, he will finish the tour.","Emmanuel Ngallos and his band who sing for peace in the Central African Republic (CAR) came under attack at a concert last year, writes Brenna Daldorph."
"The conservative Gulf kingdom also hopes to open a waxworks museum and host the superstar rapper Jay Z. General Entertainment Authority chief Turki al-Sheikh is seeking to generate billions of dollars of revenue. The attempt to turn Saudi Arabia into a regional entertainment hub is backed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. However, both his and the country's image have been tarnished in recent months by the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi - a prominent US-based critic of the government - was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in October. Saudi prosecutors have said Khashoggi was murdered in a ""rogue"" operation by intelligence agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, and put 11 individuals on trial earlier this month. But they have rejected reported Western intelligence assessments that the agents acted on the orders of Prince Mohammed, given his control over Saudi Arabia. At the launch of the GEA's entertainment strategy in Riyadh on Tuesday, Mr Sheikh listed dozens of events Saudi Arabia hoped to host in 2019. Beside from recreating Pamplona's San Fermín bull-running festival, the GEA has plans for e-gaming tournaments, musicals like Aladdin and The Lion King, and possibly an NBA basketball game. There will also be a Koranic recitation competition with a top prize worth $1.3m (£1m), and another contest for the most beautiful Muslim call to prayer, or adhan. Top magicians are due to perform too despite sorcery being a capital crime. ""I hope national companies, banks, businessmen, artists and all sectors put their hands together. There are golden opportunities,"" Mr Sheikh said. ""This is a big door for tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of jobs and for tens of billions if not hundreds of billions of riyals.""","Saudi Arabia has announced ambitious new plans for its growing state-backed entertainment sector, including a bull run like that of Pamplona in Spain."
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Some construction firms will return to work and garden centres and hardware stores can reopen. Tom Parlon, the director general of the Construction Industry Federation, estimates that about 30,000 builders - a fifth of the industry's workforce - will return to work. Social distancing will be observed on site and travelling to and from work. ""Remaining two metres apart will be a big challenge,"" he said. ""But builders will be using masks and shields to protect themselves."" On top of garden centres and hardware stores, other businesses can also reopen including opticians; motor and bike repair shops; laundries and drycleaners; and electrical, IT and phone outlets. Schools and college buildings can reopen to allow teachers to organise remote learning, while some outdoor public and tourism amenities, including car parks, beaches and mountain walks, are also able to reopen and farmers markets can be held. Up to four people who are not from the same household will be allowed to meet outdoors while observing the two metres apart rule, but funerals will still be still restricted to a maximum of 10 people. Remote working will continue for nearly all those currently doing so. Citizens are still being advised not to make unnecessary journeys and the 5km from home travel limit continues to apply. Monday will also see the return of golf and tennis, but with very strict rules. Tom Ryan, from the Elm Park Golf and Sports Club in Dublin, which has been closed since the middle of March, said that ""nearly everything that could have been touched beforehand has been removed"". Golf will be restricted to a three ball - in which only three people can play together at once - with each of the players only allowed to handle his or her own ball. Those playing must book online and provide timesheets to play. The games are not competitive and over 70s are being discouraged from playing. The Irish authorities have a five-stage plan to relax the lockdown. Pub reopening with social distancing is part of the final stage and is due on 10 August. But authorities have made it clear that if Covid-19 returns in a major way the phased relaxations may not go ahead as planned and could even be reversed.",The Republic of Ireland is beginning the first phase of relaxing its Covid-19 restrictions.
"Earlier, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the UN team would be refused entry because only Sri Lankan authorities could investigate the allegations. The UN decided earlier this year to investigate alleged crimes committed by government forces and Tamil rebels. Sri Lanka has refused to co-operate with the Human Rights Council inquiry. But UN Human Rights chief Navi Pillay said her team would be able to use technology, like internet phone service Skype and satellite imagery, to carry out its investigation. She referenced ""highly credible"" reports on abuses in Syria produced by her team despite not being allowed on the ground and said they would be able to do the same in Sri Lanka. Mr Rajapaksa has insisted that only Sri Lankan authorities could investigate the war crimes allegations. ""No one will take the UN inquiry seriously other than the people who want it,"" Mr Rajapaksa told journalists on Tuesday, reports BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen. But the UN believes Sri Lanka's own investigations have been slow and ineffective, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva. There are also real concerns that victims of violations may fear giving evidence to a government run inquiry, she adds. One UN report published three years ago said around 40,000 Tamil civilians died in the final weeks of the conflict, largely as a result of government shelling. Sri Lanka's army defeated separatist Tamil Tiger rebels after 26 years of bloody civil war in May 2009. Both sides have been accused of committing war crimes. The government has repeatedly denied that it committed war crimes and asserts that the inquiry is prejudiced.",The United Nations has insisted its investigation into alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite being told it will be denied visas.
"In doing so, it overturned an earlier decision by the electoral committee. Mr Ben-Ari has faced criticism over his comments about Israeli Arabs. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has said they amount to ""incitement to racism"". The court also reinstated Israeli Arab parties previously banned from contesting the 9 April poll. They had been barred from standing for their critical remarks about the state of Israel and the Israel Defense Forces. Ahead of the elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had forged an alliance with several far-right parties, including Jewish Power, to try to shore up support. His right-wing Likud party is seen as a strong contender despite an investigation into corruption allegations against him. The long-serving prime minister also faces a serious challenge from the new centrist Blue and White alliance led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz, which is polling just behind Likud. All governments in Israel are coalitions because the country's system of proportional representation makes it unlikely for single parties to be able to govern alone. What did the court rule? The court backed an appeal from left-wing politicians who argued that Mr Ben-Ari had made racist remarks. The Times of Israel website reports that the appeal cited Mr Ben-Ari from August 2018, saying: ""We have to change the equation regarding anyone who dares to speak against a Jew. ""[Such a person] is a dead man. He must not come out alive. No expelling him, no stripping him of his citizenship. He does not live! A firing squad takes him out as the Arabs understand [best]."" Mr Ben-Ari has claimed that he was referring to Hamas leadership - not all Arabs. And responding to Sunday's court ruling, he said: ""There is a judicial junta here which wants to take over our lives. ""They tell you there is a democracy here. It's not a democracy, there is a judicial junta here, unfortunately, which took power into its hands."" What does it mean for the elections? It is unlikely to affect the polls, as other members of Jewish Power are still allowed to run. Candidate Itamar Ben-Gvir was approved on Sunday to stand in Mr Ben-Ari's place. The court's decision marks the first time that a single candidate - not an entire party - has been banned from running in elections since electoral law changes were adopted in 2002. Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to partner with Jewish Power received rare criticism from pro-Israel lobby groups in the US - Aipac and the American Jewish Committee - who described it as a ""racist and reprehensible"" party. The ultra-right party includes disciples of the late anti-Arab extremist rabbi Meir Kahane, who led a right-wing fundamentalist group in the 1980s that advocated attacks on Arabs, and was later outlawed under Israeli anti-terrorist legislation. Israel's Supreme Court also approved on Sunday a candidate from the radical socialist Hadash party, and overturned a ban on an Israeli-Arab alliance called Raam-Balad, which had been accused of links to Palestinian militants.","Israel's Supreme Court has disqualified the leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, Michael Ben-Ari, from next month's elections."
"The traditional offering is made to ensure deceased loved ones can dress well in the afterlife. Pollution in Beijing regularly reaches unhealthy levels. Tight regulations are already in place on polluting factories, construction sites and car use in the capital. The burning of clothes and other goods is practiced by many in China as part of a ritual to mourn the dead and provide for them in the afterlife. But a notice at Beijing's Babaoshan cemetery posted on 27 October said that ""the incineration of the clothing of the deceased will be suspended"" from 1 to 15 November due to Apec, said Beijing News. The practise is a relatively small source of smoke compared to the heavy air pollution caused by the use of coal to generate electricity and power factories. However, Chinese authorities have previously targeted these kinds of sources banning, for example, the use of street-side grills. The Apec gathering of leaders from Asia Pacific nations including the US, Russia and Japan begins in Beijing on Wednesday. Government workers in the city have been given an extended holiday, all construction work has been halted and half of all private vehicles have been banned from roads in an attempt to rein in pollution levels. Hebei province which borders Beijing has also suspended productions at companies and construction sites, according to state-run media. China Daily newspaper said on Tuesday that air quality had already improved. Last month, thousands of thousands of participants in the 34th Beijing International Marathon ran wearing face masks because of heavy smog. Estimates said that pollution had soared above the maximum recommended World Health Organization levels, forcing many runners to pull out.","Authorities in Beijing have banned the burning of dead relatives' clothes during the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit as an anti-pollution measure, local media report."
"By Deirdre FinnertyBBC News It is the first time the Irish parliament has addressed the issue since the Eighth Amendment - a near total constitutional ban on abortion - was removed. The country voted to overturn its abortion ban in a referendum in May. Health Minister Simon Harris hopes abortion services will be available in the country from January. The Regulation of the Termination of Pregnancy Bill allows for abortion services to be provided ""on demand"" up to the 12th week of a pregnancy, in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality or where the physical or mental health of the mother is in danger. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and Mr Harris have both said they expect services to be up and running in Ireland by early next year. Mr Harris has said that terminations would be made available free of charge, as part of a GP-led service. Introducing the bill in the Dail, Mr Harris said the referendum was a resounding affirmation of support for right of women to make choices about their lives. ""It was a reaffirmation of the primacy of equality in our modern democracy and it was also a call for us to do more,"" he said. ""More on women's health, women's equality, more on continuing to shape an inclusive and equal society."" What happens next? The bill must be passed by the Irish parliament and the Irish senate before it officially becomes law. Anti-abortion TDs have said they want to table amendments to the legislation. The health minister has said he will not accept them as the Irish people gave a clear mandate ""to get on with it"" when they voted to overturn the abortion ban by 66.4% to 33.6%. Separate legislation will be introduced at a later date to allow for ""safe access"" zones - designated areas that prevent protests around centres providing abortion services. The government must work with doctors to implement services and provide training and support. Dr Mary Favier, founder of Doctors for Choice, told the Irish Times that planning for abortion by the Department of Health had been ""a shambles"". ""There's been no clinical lead appointments. There's been no technical round tables established. There's been effectively no meetings held,"" she said. Mike Thompson, a GP in east Cork told the BBC the the government's proposed timeline of January 2019 was ""ambitious"" and ""challenging."" ""Unless there is a clear and robust guidelines, no GP will provide the service. It has to be safe."" Doctors objecting Earlier, a row broke out over conscientious objection, as anti-abortion doctors said they did not wish to be forced to refer a pregnant woman seeking a termination to another doctor. The bill allows for doctors to opt out of providing a medical or surgical abortion if they do not wish to perform the procedure. But they must refer a woman seeking an abortion to another doctor who will carry it out. Anti-abortion doctors have lobbied the government to remove any requirement to transfer women seeking a termination to another doctor. Dr Kirsten Fuller, spokesperson for Doctors for Freedom of Conscience estimates that ""several hundred"" doctors objected to this. She told the BBC: ""We don't want to thwart the referendum result, we're just asking that we're given freedom of conscience in the truest form where we don't have to refer to another doctor."" ""Abortion is the ending of a human life and we don't want to partake in that in any sense."" ""We want to continue to give compassionate care to all mothers and their children,"" she said. The health minister said that conscientious objection was one thing, but refusing to refer women wishing to terminate their pregnancies to other doctors was quite another. Has conscientious objection worked elsewhere? Abortion has been legal in Italy, a predominantly Catholic country, since 1978, but it can be difficult for women to access the procedure there. The proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. In southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%. In 2014, a Polish doctor was sacked after refusing to perform an abortion on faith grounds. Two Roman Catholic midwives in Scotland lost a legal battle in 2012 to avoid taking part in abortion procedures because of their conscientious objections. It is unclear how a small number of GPs objecting will affect the rollout of services in Ireland.",The Irish parliament is debating a bill to legalise abortion services in the country.
"It is an anti-government gesture used by protesters in the Oromia region. Ethiopia's government normally keeps a tight grip on the country and there has not been anything on this scale in the last 25 years. Why now? There has not been a specific trigger and what we are seeing is an accumulation of years of frustration from ethnic groups who say they have been marginalised by the government. Demonstrations began in Oromia last November. Protests have also sprung up more recently in the Amhara region. Oromia and Amhara are the homelands of the country's two biggest ethnic groups. New York-based Human Rights Watch says that more than 400 people have been killed in clashes with the security forces in Oromia, although the government disputes this figure. So what is behind this? The Oromos, who make up around a third of the population, have long complained that they have been excluded from the country's political process and the economic development which has seen the capital, Addis Ababa, transformed in recent years. The protests were initially over a plan to expand the boundaries of Addis Ababa into the Oromia region. That plan was dropped, but the demonstrations exposed some underlying issues and protests continued with the latest round taking place on Saturday in many places in Oromia and the capital, Addis Ababa. At the root of the recent demonstrations in Amhara is a request by representatives from the Welkait Amhara Identity Committee that their land, which is currently administered by the Tigray regional state, be moved into the neighbouring Amhara region. The Welkait committee says community members identify themselves as ethnic Amharas and say they no longer want to be ruled by Tigrayans. Amharas used to form the country's elite and the language, Amharic, remains the most widely spoken in the country. Ethiopia's ethnic make-up Source: CIA World Factbook estimates from 2007 Is there a connection between the protest movements? Observers say that Ethiopia's governing coalition is dominated by the party from the small Tigray region (TPLF), that led the guerrilla war against the military regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam. Some see both sets of protests as a way of criticising the country's government. There is no formal connection between the Amhara and Oromia demonstrations but at a recent protest in Gondar, banners could be seen expressing solidarity with people from the Oromia region. Oromo activists referred to the demonstrations in Amhara in their Facebook post calling for protests on the first weekend in August - when Amnesty International said that more than 100 people died - but highlighted the fact that they thought the protesters there had been treated more leniently. Is the government in trouble? The central government, a close ally of the West, is in a very powerful position and has total control over the security forces. There is not a single opposition member in parliament, so it faces no real political threat. But its reaction to a big protest at the beginning of August suggests that it is worried: It shut down the internet across the country for two days, fearing that was how the demonstrations were being organised. There is only one, state-controlled internet service provider so this was fairly straightforward. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn then issued a veiled threat to protesters saying that the government was obliged to ensure the rule of law. But he did not specify what that meant in practice. He also appeared to be concerned that the country was sliding into ethnic conflict, which could become difficult to contain.",Ethiopia's Olympic marathon silver medallist Feyisa Lilesa crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race in Rio - bringing the world's attention to a wave of protests in his home country.
"By Andrew HoskenBBC News The young investigative reporter had been working on a sensational story for his news website, Aktuality.SK. It was a scoop that would bring down the government of his native Slovakia. But it cost him his life. He and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova were found shot dead at close range at their home in the village of Vel'ka Maca outside the capital, Bratislava. They were only 27. Tentacles of Italian organised crime Kuciak had uncovered a story that takes in the mafia heartlands of southern Italy and led to the City of London. It involves mobsters, hit men, politicians and money launderers and reveals that the mafia has spread far beyond Italy. Slovakia's reaction to the double murder was immediate. There were huge street protests in Bratislava that eventually led in March to the fall of the government, then headed by Prime Minister Roberto Fico. Jan Kuciak's investigation was only published after his death. He had exposed the presence of the 'Ndrangheta in Slovakia. But he also discovered apparent business links between an alleged 'Ndrangheta member called Antonino Vadala and two senior government advisers. Both advisers worked for Prime Minister Fico, although no evidence has emerged that he knew of the links. They too stepped down temporarily while the matter is being investigated but vehemently denied any connection with ""this horrid crime"". Antonino Vadala claimed he was simply an entrepreneur, but he was subsequently extradited to Italy where he faces charges for cocaine smuggling. He faced separate charges in Slovakia for attempting to fraudulently obtain European Union subsidies. He denies all charges. Meanwhile the hunt for the killer of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova goes on. Kuciak discovered that Antonino Vadala was a member of the notorious Vadala clan based in the small town of Bova Marina in Calabria in the south of Italy. The family is one of 150 clans that constitute the highly secretive 'Ndrangheta. 'Ndrangheta: Rise of a mafia empire Bova Marina is a small coastal town where old people shelter from the midday sun in fly-blown bars or under the palm trees and bougainvillea of the small local park. The town's large pink town hall has been closed for years. The government has suspended the local council, the Comune di Bova, due to mafia infiltration. For around 140 years, the 'Ndrangheta has been the real power in Bova. Here, two clans hold sway together - the Vadalas and the Libris. The 'Ndrangheta began as bandits after the unification of Italy in 1871 and is now considered the most powerful organised crime syndicate in the world with an estimated 10,000 members. It controls more than 80% of the cocaine smuggled into Europe from Central America and makes up to €90bn (£80bn; $104bn) a year. It smuggles people and organs too, and earns billions from embezzling funds from the European Union and local government. The BBC has learned that the 'Ndrangheta is laundering billions of euros in illicit profits through the City of London with the help of corrupt ""enablers"", including lawyers and accountants. Law enforcement agencies in the UK and Italy have joined forces to investigate what legendary anti-mafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri describes as a global entity. ""The 'Ndrangheta's based on family and blood ties that makes it hard to penetrate,"" says Judge Gratteri, who has convicted more than 6,000 mafiosi over a 35-year career. In Condofuri, which borders Bova Marina, a sign above the town hall reads: ""The 'Ndrangheta does not enter here."" Infiltration meant that its town hall also had to close and the former mayor and council were suspended after mafia attempts to win public works contracts. The new mayor, Salvatore Mafrici, is a leading anti-mafia activist who complains that organised crime has stunted the town's growth. ""Our best people are forced to leave this enormously beautiful place. This stems from our main problem - the heavy weight on our shoulders that is the 'Ndrangheta."" Italy's main anti-mafia police, the Guardia di Finanza, estimates that the group now operates in 50 countries around the world, and it is working with the UK's National Crime Agency on its money-laundering activities in the City of London. ""We have more than reasonable grounds to think... London is one of the places they buy properties to invest the money,"" says Col Emilio Fiora of the Guardia. The UK's National Crime Agency would not comment on any current investigation but told the BBC that organised crime syndicates laundered hundreds of billions of pounds a year through London, mainly through complicated company structures. The agency's head of partnerships and threat reduction, Emma Smith, said corrupt professionals were helping organised crime groups to launder money. ""The City of London is a major financial centre so it is only natural that the volume of transactions going in and out of London on any given day is enormous. There is a proportion of that which is illicit finance,"" she said. Judge Nicola Gratteri called on law enforcement agencies across the world to take the growing threat from the 'Ndrangheta seriously. ""If these billions of euros that the 'Ndrangheta makes from selling cocaine become part of the formal economy, they could blow up the economy and destroy democracy,"" he warned.",Jan Kuciak's desk was kept just as it was the day he left work for the last time. On it lay a book about Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia.
"Sheila Atieno* is on standby to help a young woman who is 32 weeks pregnant deliver her baby. Dr Atieno has done this many times before. But this birth, when it happens, will be unusual. The expectant woman was brought into a special ward at a public hospital in the capital, Nairobi, after testing positive for coronavirus. Dr Atieno, a consultant obstetrician gynaecologist, is part of a small team of doctors who have been identified to attend to expectant women who display symptoms of the virus. Dr Atieno's world has changed drastically. She is a mother of two children under the age of two years. ""It's been very difficult to cope with the fact that I will be specifically attending to expectant mothers who are infected with the virus,"" she tells me. ""I'm about to perform a caesarean section, which usually involves handling a lot of body fluids. Although I'll carry out the operation while dressed in a protective suit, it makes you quite hot and uncomfortable. ""And when I get home, the children will want to rush into my arms. But I can't touch them until I have changed, showered and sanitised myself. ""It's tough mentally and emotionally. But I have no choice - it's my job to usher in new life, with or without the pandemic,"" Dr Atieno says. The newly wed couple Francis and Veronica Gitonga are a young couple on honeymoon at their rural home in Nyahururu, which is about 200km (125 miles) from Nairobi. They had planned their wedding for 5 April. They invited 500 guests to witness the big moment when they would each say: ""I do!"" But when they did, only six people were allowed inside the church - the bride, the groom, their best couple and two presiding pastors. No parents, no family, no village mates. Social distancing rules and travel restrictions brought about by Covid-19 distanced hundreds of people from their wedding. The couple held their wedding reception at home with only 12 people present. They had the option of postponing their wedding until life returns to normal. But they chose not to. I asked the couple if they regretted not delaying the wedding to allow more of their family and friends to attend. ""No, we have no regrets,"" says Mr Gitonga, who works with the Redeemed Gospel Church in Nyahururu. ""We felt like God had spoken to us to go ahead with the wedding. After all, Veronica and I love each other deeply and being joined together in church before God was all we ever wanted. Mr Gitonga told me Covid-19 not only changed the couple's wedding plans, it brought some unexpected benefits. ""Our wedding was going to cost about 300,000 Kenya shillings ($2,800; £2,250). But without the guests, the catering, hire of a venue, etc, in the end we only spent 50,000 Kenya shillings. ""And now we are receiving a lot of calls from young people in different parts of Kenya saying we inspired them to do humble weddings instead of marrying big and then falling into debt."" Mr and Mrs Gitonga's is a story of true love in the midst of a pandemic. It's also the shape of a new normal in Kenya - small, intimate and pocket-friendly weddings. The mourning family During the night-time curfew imposed by the government to try and curb the spread of the virus, a 13-year-old boy, Yassin Hussein Moyo, was shot dead by police. Yassin is not the only victim. Across the country people are nursing broken limbs and other serious injuries inflicted by the heavy hand of a police force whose motto ironically is, ""Service to all"". Covid-19 has opened the door to state-sanctioned brutality. Yassin's father, Hussein Moyo, bitterly captured the sentiments of many Kenyans when he said at his son's funeral: ""During the day we face the threat of the virus and at night we have to contend with police terror."" Kenyans, most of whom earn a meagre income from the informal sector, are frequently heard on radio and TV explaining how they have to grapple with three enemies - the new coronavirus, hunger and the police. The ridiculed politician James Orengo is a veteran politician and an elected senator from the main opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party. He usually has his finger on the pulse of the nation. At a special Senate sitting on electoral laws in January 2017, Mr Orengo, who is a lawyer, spoke on the dangers of passing bad laws and famously warned ruling party legislators not to be too comfortable in government. ""Sometimes revolutions eat their own children… governments eat their own people. This government is going to punish you more than they will punish me, I am telling you,"" he said. ""In another one year you'll be crying in my office to come and represent you."" That quote is one of the most cited by Kenyans. But with Covid-19, Mr Orengo misread the mood of the public when he tweeted: ""Drove myself to parliament to take the COVID-19 test. Compliance with the guidelines critical in the fight against the pandemic."" The backlash was immediate. ""So where do commoners like us drive ourselves to?"" tweeted one Kenyan, and another tweeted: ""Politicians really think that driving themselves is such a big deal. What's wrong with this country?"" Overall, the Covid-19 crisis has wiped away politicians' ubiquitous presence from the media and Kenyans seem to be enjoying the peace and quiet. There appears to be an unspoken rule among media organisations - keep politicians off the news agenda unless they are speaking in a medical or other relevant professional capacity. Politicians must be worrying what will happen if Kenyans get used to life without them. The lucky prisoner Covid-19 has forced justice to go digital in Kenya with some magistrates using video links to serve their orders. One beneficiary of this is a man accused of stealing a bible from a supermarket. Following proceedings via a TV screen while in police custody, he was relieved to hear that he will now continue his case as a free person after the judge ordered his release on a free bond. It's part of new government efforts to tackle Covid-19 by decongesting prisons, which has already resulted in the release of 4,800 petty offenders. The man in the bible court case will no doubt be using a bible to join other Kenyans praying to be spared the worst ravages of Covid-19. Life, clearly, cannot be the same again. * The doctor's real name was not used because she was not authorised to speak to the media.

"Wuhan's population is estimated at 11 million, which suggests that almost 500,000 people may have had the virus. If true, that is almost 10 times higher than Wuhan's officially recorded number of 50,354 cases. Asymptomatic cases are not counted in China's official case tally. The study, carried out early this year, took samples from 34,000 people in Wuhan, as well the broader Hubei province, Beijing, Shanghai and four other provinces, said China's CDC in a statement on WeChat. Researchers found an antibody prevalence rate of 4.43% in Wuhan, and a prevalence rate of 0.44% in the broader Hubei province. The study comes ahead of a visit by a team of international scientists to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the virus. They will visit next month, following months of negotiations with Beijing, who had been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry. China had earlier this year been accused of a lack of transparency over its virus figures, with critics casting doubt on the extent to which their numbers could be trusted. The CDC statement added that only two people tested positive for the antibody among the 12,000 people tested outside Hubei. The study was conducted one month after China ""contained the first wave"" of the pandemic It concluded that the number of people infected outside Wuhan was low, saying that this suggested measures taken in Wuhan had prevented the virus from spreading on a larger scale. Earlier this year, the virus was traced to a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan, and it was suggested that this was where it made the leap from animals to humans. But experts now believe it may simply have been amplified there.","Almost 5% of the people in the Chinese city of Wuhan may have been infected with Covid-19, a study by researchers at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has shown."
"Over 440 animals, including the highly endangered one-horned rhino, have been killed in flood-related incidents, forest official D Gogoi told the BBC. Kaziranga is home to nearly two-thirds of the world's remaining one-horned rhinos. The majority of the animals killed - 379 - were hog deer, Mr Gogoi said. Mr Gogoi said the bodies of 441 animals, including seven rhinos and nine swamp deer, have been found in the flooded national park. He said two rhinos, who may have escaped the rising waters, have been poached in nearby hills. Park workers have rescued 94 animals stranded in the waterlogged park, Mr Gogoi said. ""The death toll could rise further. We will assess the damage after the waters recede,"" he said. Over 80 people have died and almost one million people have been forced to leave their homes by floods in Assam, officials say. Officials say this is the worst flood in the state since 1998.","Hundred of animals have been found dead in the Kaziranga national park in the north-east Indian state of Assam, which has been hit by severe floods."
"Police were called to a shooting in Kungsholmen at around 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Friday. Paramedics took one person, a man in his 50s, to hospital with gunshot wounds, police said. The Swedish Bar Association has confirmed the victim is Henrik Olsson Lilja, CBS News reported. Mr Lilja is reported to be in a serious but stable condition and one suspect has been arrested. The lawyer represented ASAP Rocky after the rapper's arrest in Stockholm over an assault during a street brawl on 30 June. On its website, Stockholm Police described the shooting as ""an isolated incident with no known connection to recent violent crimes"". What happened? Mr Lilja was shot in the head and chest at his block of flats and then called the police himself with a neighbour's phone, according to Swedish newspaper Expressen. A witness told the paper Mr Lilja was shot while wrestling with a man on the ground. The gunman, who fled the scene in a black SUV, is still at large, the paper reported. A suspect has been arrested and several people were questioned in connection with the shooting, which is being investigated as an ""attempted murder"", police said. The suspect in custody was a woman, also a senior lawyer, who had connections with Mr Lilja, Expressen reported. How was Mr Lilja involved in ASAP Rocky's case? Mr Lilja initially represented ASAP Rocky in the assault case, but was reportedly replaced by defence lawyer Slobodan Jovicic for the trial. Last month ASAP Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, was found guilty of assaulting 19-year-old Mustafa Jafari during a fight in Stockholm. The 30-year-old rapper was given a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to pay damages to the victim. ASAP Rocky and his co-defendants, Bladimir Corniel and David Rispers, claimed they had been acting in self-defence against two men who had been following their group. The case attracted international attention when US President Donald Trump intervened, claiming the rapper was being treated unfairly.",A prominent Swedish lawyer who represented US rapper ASAP Rocky in a recent assault case has reportedly been shot multiples times in Stockholm.
"By Jay Mazoomdaar Delhi When recent media reports claimed that New Delhi was breathing in more pollution than Beijing, government agencies in India promptly dismissed it as hot air. Even before Dr Angel Hsu, principal investigator of the 2014 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) clarified that EPI did not rank New Delhi and Beijing for want of comparable data, India's government, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and the city-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) made claims and counter claims on air pollution levels in the two cities. The jury is still out. ""Worse than Beijing's or not, Delhi's air quality is certainly very poor and only getting worse. But our authorities have done little to reverse the trend, partly because public awareness is far from adequate,"" says Ravi Aggarwal, director of the NGO, Toxic Links. Too little, too lax In stark contrast to Beijing where levels of PM10 (particulate matter up to 10 micrometres in size) decreased by about 40% between 2000 and 2013, Delhi's PM10 levels have gone up by about 47% from 2000 to 2011. The result is that Delhi's PM10 levels are nearly twice as much as in Beijing. Last year, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau announced plans to invest 300bn yuan to reduce levels of PM2.5 (which is more harmful than PM10 as it penetrates deeper into the lung) to 60 microgram/cum in five years. The levels of PM2.5 in Delhi are on the rise, from 168 m/cum in January 2011 to 183 m/cum last month. To turn the pollution clock back, Beijing has brought down the number of cars that can be sold in a year, denied any significant price advantage to diesel cars, introduced Euro V standards, invested in public transport and reined in polluting industries. China is also imposing heavy fines on local governments that fail to keep air pollution at sub-critical levels. Delhi, in fact, had a head-start in 2000 when compressed natural gas (CNG) was made mandatory for buses and three wheelers, or auto rickshaws. Since then, the city has taken old commercial vehicles off the road, introduced Euro IV emission standards, set up intra-city metro railways and added a new fleet of buses to expand public transport. The city government also moved out polluting factories, introduced stricter norms for power plants and banned open burning of refuse and leaves. But either the scale of intervention or the enforcement has been inadequate. Cars, kilns and fireworks The CNG advantage was soon squandered due to Delhi's ever expanding fleet of more than eight million vehicles. ""Parking is virtually free in Delhi. There is no congestion tax; no incentive for petrol-run cars. Public transport lacks feeder services and last mile connectivity. Heavy traffic makes cars crawl and spew more fumes. The pollution levels are now worse than pre-CNG days,"" says Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of CSE. In an ever expanding Delhi, the dumping of massive quantities of construction waste is a major reason for heavy dust pollution. As is substantial loss of city forests that once stood in the way of dusty winds from the arid west. Between November and February, air pollution levels peak anyway due to a drop in temperature and frequent calm wind conditions. A string of seasonal activities in and around Delhi makes it far worse. More than 1,000 brick kilns that cater to Delhi's construction boom burn away within 20km (12 miles) of the city during the dry winter spell, according to Dr Sarath Guttikunda, director of Urban Emissions Info. Agricultural waste is set on fire across thousands of hectares around Delhi to clear cropland, which burns for days on end. Massive quantities of fireworks go up in smoke during the festival of Diwali and year-end celebrations. The city's poor and homeless burn rubbish to stay warm at night. Breathing this poison keeps Delhi chronically sick. The 2013 Global Burden of Disease report identified air pollution, a Class 1 carcinogen according to the World Health Organisation, as the fifth largest killer in India where more people die of asthma than anywhere else in the world. Air pollution is also a trigger for heart attack and cancer. In 2008, the Central Pollution Control Board studied 11,628 children from 36 schools in Delhi and found reduced lung function in 43.5% of them. In 2013, the World Allergy Organisation reported high respiratory disorder symptoms in students residing in north (66%), west (59%) and south (46%) Delhi. Yet, Delhi Pollution Control Commitee official Sandeep Mishra admits that an ""action plan"" to fight air pollution has been on hold since 2012. Air quality is also not on the 17-point agenda of the new Delhi government under anti-corruption crusader Arvind Kejriwal who took the oath in late December when air pollution levels had peaked. ""Mr Kejriwal has not recovered from a cough and cold ever since he took charge as the chief minister. If anyone, he understands the city's respiratory problems,"" quipped a senior health official. Jay Mazoomdaar is an independent journalist who writes for publications in India and abroad.","The US-based Environmental Preference Index has denied media reports suggesting it found air quality in Delhi worse than in Beijing. But while China's capital appears to be slowly turning the pollution clock back, India's first city seems to have given up the fight for clean air, reports Jay Mazoomdaar."
"The city of Hamburg had rejected Juergen Roemer's plea to be put in a more favourable tax category. But that decision may amount to sex discrimination, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled. Mr Roemer claimed he was entitled to 302 euros (£265) a month more. The judges said that under German law same-sex partnerships - called ""registered life partnerships"" - are now comparable to marriage. Mr Roemer had worked for the Hamburg city authorities for 40 years. He retired in 1990 and in October 2001 told his former employer that he had established a registered life partnership with his male partner. Mr Roemer had been living with his companion since 1969 and German same-sex partnerships were given legal status in February 2001. While many European states recognise homosexual civil unions, only Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Norway and Iceland legally acknowledge same-sex marriage. The ECJ ruling on Tuesday may give legal weight to similar claims in other EU countries. The judges said individuals could claim against a local authority for the right to equal treatment under EU law, even if national law contained no provision relevant to their case.",The EU's top court has ruled that a retired German man in a same-sex civil partnership should enjoy the same tax status as a married man when his pension is calculated.
"Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been detained in Iran since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denies all the charges against her. Concerns for her wellbeing escalated last week when news emerged that she had been transferred to Qarchak, a notorious prison in the desert. The jail is sometimes used as punishment for Iranian political prisoners and conditions have been described by former inmates as abysmal. But in a statement, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said Ambassador Lyndall Sachs had been granted access to Ms Moore-Gilbert on Sunday and found her to be well. She ""has access to food, medical facilities and books"", the statement said, adding that Australia would continue to seek ""regular consular access"". ""We believe that the best chance of resolving Dr Moore-Gilbert's case lies through the diplomatic path,"" it said. Ms Moore-Gilbert's family said they were ""reassured"" by the ambassador's visit. ""We remain committed to getting our Kylie home as soon as possible and this is our top and only priority,"" they added. What is Ms Moore-Gilbert's situation? The Cambridge-educated academic was travelling on an Australian passport when she was detained at Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave following a conference. Before being moved to Qarchak prison, she had spent almost two years sleeping on the floor of a cell at Evin prison in the capital, Tehran, according to a friend. She has been in solitary confinement and on several hunger strikes, and she is said to have been beaten for trying to comfort new prisoners by passing notes and writing to them on prison walls. In letters smuggled out of Evin prison in January, the lecturer said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country,"" she wrote. You might be interested in watching:","Australia's ambassador to Iran has visited a British-Australian academic serving a 10-year sentence for espionage and found that she is ""well""."
"Around 700 counter-terrorism troops will be removed over the next few years, the Department of Defense said. About 7,200 US soldiers are currently based in dozens of African countries including Nigeria and Libya. There will now be a shift away from tactical assistance to advising and sharing intelligence in West Africa, the Pentagon said. However, counter-terrorism activities in several countries including Somalia and Djibouti will remain largely the same. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to Reuters, said the reduction of troops would likely take place over three years and could include countries such as Kenya, Cameroon and Mali. Pentagon spokeswoman Candice Tresch said: ""We will realign our counter-terrorism resources and forces operating in Africa over the next several years in order to maintain a competitive posture worldwide."" A military official said an attack in Niger in October 2017 in which four US troops were killed did not play a role in the decision to cut troops, the Voice of America reports. The move comes as US President Donald Trump works to implement his National Defense Strategy, which ushers in a new era of ""Great Power competition"" with Moscow and Beijing. On Wednesday, a bipartisan congressional panel reviewing the strategy said America's focus on counter-insurgency operations had weakened its military capability. Why is the US cutting troops in Africa? By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa Security Correspondent The announcement of cuts has been coming for some time. In January, the US Defence Secretary James Mattis unveiled a new strategy indicating a shift away from terrorism and towards America's standing when compared to Russia and China. While the cuts begin in Africa, they will eventually affect US military personnel elsewhere. The funding will now be put into military muscle-flexing, as Beijing and Moscow embark on renewed global ambitions. The Pentagon will feel it has been successful in training partner forces in Africa and setting them up to competently fight insurgent groups - particularly Islamist extremists. An example is in Cameroon, where the US feels local Special Forces are now able to operate independently. Even though the US has spent years growing a secret military footprint across Africa, it will only keep those that are most essential, and focus on areas where there is a security vacuum, such as Libya and Somalia.",The US is cutting hundreds of troops in Africa as it focuses on countering threats from Russia and China.
"Brian Sicknick, 42, was injured while ""physically engaging with protesters"", police said. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said no resources would be spared to hold those responsible to account. Flags over the Capitol were lowered in the officer's honour on Friday. Sicknick's death was the fifth linked to Wednesday's riots, which have led to calls for President Donald Trump to be removed from office. Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt was shot by a police officer, while three others died after suffering unspecified medical emergencies. The chief of the US Capitol Police (USCP) said more than 50 law enforcement officers had been injured during the siege. What do we know about Brian Sicknick's death? The details surrounding Sicknick's death are still unclear. In a statement, the USCP said Sicknick died at approximately 21:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Thursday ""due to injuries sustained while on duty"". He was responding to the riots at the US Capitol when he was injured, the force said. ""He returned to his division office and collapsed. He was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,"" it said. Citing two law enforcement officials, the New York Times reported that Sicknick was struck with a fire extinguisher at some point during the breach of Congress. However, reports of an attack haven't been confirmed. On Friday, Mr Rosen said the FBI and Washington police would jointly investigate Sicknick's death, although he did not say if it would be treated as suspected murder. US broadcaster CNN, citing a law enforcement official, reported that federal prosecutors were planning to open a murder investigation. Who was Brian Sicknick? Sicknick was born the youngest of three brothers in South River, New Jersey. He ""wanted to be a police officer his entire life"", his brother, Ken Sicknick, said in a statement. ""Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,"" his brother said. Sicknick joined the Capitol Police in July 2008 and most recently served in the department's First Responder's Unit. Prior to that, he served in the New Jersey Air National Guard, which he joined in 1997. He was deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1999 in support of Operation Southern Watch, and in Kyrgyzstan in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Iraq War. He was honourably discharged in 2003. ""Staff Sgt Sicknick's commitment to service and protect his community, state, and nation will never be forgotten,"" the New Jersey National Guard said. What has the reaction been? The White House and senior politicians, both Democratic and Republican, have been paying their respects to Sicknick. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the flags at the Capitol building to be lowered to half-mast. ""The violent and deadly act of insurrection targeting the Capitol, our temple of American democracy, and its workers was a profound tragedy and stain on our nation's history,"" she said in a statement. A spokesman for President Trump said that he and his ""entire administration extend our prayers to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's family as we all grieve the loss of this American hero"". Virginia Democrat Don Beyer has called for Sicknick to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, saying ""he made the ultimate sacrifice"" to protect lawmakers. Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn said she was ""truly devastated"" by the news. Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of the district of Columbia, paid tribute to Sicknick in a tweet. Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz has faced a backlash after tweeting that Sicknick was ""a true hero"". Mr Cruz, a loyal ally of the president, led the campaign in the Senate against certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election win. Serious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government. The chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, initially defended his force, but resigned soon after.","The FBI will join an investigation into the death of a police officer from injuries sustained during the pro-Trump siege of the US Capitol, authorities say."
"An investigation showed that officials ""used crude means"" to persuade Feng Jianmei to agree to the abortion, Xinhua news agency reports. Ms Feng's pregnancy was terminated at seven months because she had violated the one-child policy law. Photos of her with the foetus caused widespread condemnation online. China's one-child family planning policy aims to control the country's population, which now stands at around 1.3bn. Rights groups say the law has meant women being coerced into abortions, which Beijing denies. Ms Feng's case has come to symbolise the extreme measures some officials take in order to meet population targets, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Officials punished Officials in China's north-west province of Shaanxi were punished for having ""violated the laws of central and local government on family planning"", Xinhua reports. The head of the family planning bureau in Zhenping county, Jiang Nenghai, had been sacked. Another family planning official had also been given ""administrative demerits"", Xinhua said. Other officials in connection with the case had also been punished, Xinhua said, without elaborating further. ""According to the investigation, while persuading Feng to receive the abortion, some staff of the township government used crude means to violate her intentions,"" Xinhua says. ""There was also no legal basis for the township government's demand that Feng and her family pay a deposit of 40,000 yuan [$6,300] for a certificate allowing her to have her second child,"" it added. Ms Feng will be given compensation, Xinhua adds, without providing the details. A relative of Ms Feng's told reporters on Tuesday that the family had been harassed since leaving hospital, possibly with the tacit encouragement of local government officials embarrassed by the scandal after the family spoke to foreign media. Pictures circulating on the internet appeared to show a large red banner saying: ""Beat the traitors, drive them from the town"", strung up in Shaanxi. The relative added that Ms Feng's husband, Deng Jiyuan, had gone into hiding on Sunday because of the harassment. ''We are not in touch with my brother,'' Mr Deng's sister, Deng Jicai, told the BBC on Wednesday. ''My sister-in-law is also experiencing heavy pressure.'' Ms Deng also said that people had been calling her family traitors and this had caused them ''great psychological trauma''. ''She [Ms Feng] had already been traumatised from the abortion, now somehow she's accused of being a traitor.''","A Chinese official has been sacked and others punished over the case of a woman forced to have a late-term abortion, state-run media report."
"By Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, State Department Correspondent The uneasiness began with an unorthodox overhaul of senior staff positions, and escalated into a simmering revolt against a controversial policy seen as cutting to the core of the department's work and values. In Mr Tillerson's inbox is a ""dissent cable"" opposing President Trump's temporary ban on refugees and travellers from seven majority Muslim nations, signed by more than 1,000 foreign service staff. The ban was imposed in order to review security checks, but the cable argues that the way it's being carried out will be ineffective and counterproductive. More than that, it says the executive order betrays fundamental principles of equality, openness and non-discrimination. ""We're sworn to defend and protect the constitution,"" said one official who'd signed the document, ""and are duty bound to speak out when constitutional values are at stake."" Rex Tillerson - the wild card diplomat Diplomats' dissent falls on deaf ears Mr Tillerson, who comes with years of business experience at Exxon Mobil but none in government or diplomacy, will need to find a way to both address such deep concerns and to work with a Trump White House bent on shaking up the system with quick pronouncements of change. In a debut speech kicking off his first day on the job he signalled he would take a more traditional approach than his boss, praising the expertise of the diplomatic corps and saying he would depend on it. But he'll be learning the ropes with a lack of experienced personnel at the top, including those who would oversee the implementation of this controversial policy. ""Why would you get rid of the heads of administration and consular affairs when you've just done something that affects so many visa and documentation issues?"" muses Richard Boucher, a long-time career ambassador. Mr Boucher has seen administrations come and go - he served as a spokesman or deputy spokesmen in six of them, both Republican and Democrat. It's perfectly normal, he says, to clean house at the top during a transition. What isn't normal is the way this administration went about it: abruptly, without overlap or immediate replacement, clearing out management as well as policy positions. Of approximately 40 posts that need Senate approval, only six or seven have been filled, according to Tom Countryman. Until Friday, he was the assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation, expecting to retire sometime later in the year. So he was surprised to be told that his retirement would begin in two days. He cut short a trip to Amman, where he was discussing nuclear non-proliferation in the Middle East, cancelled a planned meeting in Rome, and flew home to clear out his desk. In most cases there continue to be capable deputies running the show, he says, but the ""vacuum"" at the very top will make it difficult for Rex Tillerson to ""get a running start"". The Texan oilman has been hobbled at the starting gate with delays over his confirmation, leaving old timers and newcomers in the department warily adjusting to each other. Career diplomats have said some of the new officials don't tend to engage, keeping the doors to their offices closed. One employee fresh off the Trump campaign described co-workers as ""experienced"" and ""great assets"" but said she'd been forewarned that the scene could be ""liberal and cliquey"". Trump border policy: Who's affected? But the opposition to the immigration order is much more than a culture clash. ""I've never heard of anything close to this [number of signatures],"" says Jon Finer, who handled such cables in his position as director of policy planning for the former Secretary of State John Kerry. The dissent channel is an established avenue for diplomats to express alternative viewpoints without fear of retaliation. In some years it's barely used, in others there's a lot of traffic - like during the Vietnam War, and the conflicts in Bosnia, Iraq and Syria. The BBC first heard about the cable from diplomatic sources overseas. As the document circulated informally between foreign missions and Washington headquarters, it grew to 155 pages of signatures, according to a source close to the process. Officials said it was fuelled by the distress of people on the frontlines charged with implementing a policy that had been sprung without warning or consultation, leaving them to deal with confusing details and navigate the impact on individuals and relations with foreign countries. Mr Tillerson has not clarified his position on the executive order, but he did acknowledge the fallout from a ""hotly contested"" election and appeared to allude to the concerns of his new employees. He told them they were entitled to the expression of their political beliefs, but couldn't let these overwhelm their work as a team. The White House, on the other hand, has taken a tough line. Spokesman Sean Spicer said dissenters ""should either get with the programme or they can go"", although he later added that they had the right to speak out but not to refuse implementation of a lawful order. There've been no reports of such obstruction, but some who agreed with the sentiment of the memo chose not to sign because they were afraid the new administration would take retaliatory measures, one career officer told the BBC. Tom Countryman said it would be important for the new secretary of state to make clear he'd protect his employees from any retribution. In a speech at his goodbye party, Mr Countryman pushed back against the anger, encouraging his colleagues to stay in their positions, ""because a foreign policy without professionals is - by definition - an amateur foreign policy. You will help to frame and make the choices"". Other administrations have come in suspicious of the state department because it works with foreigners, he told the BBC, ""and for a party that's xenophobic, that's a real suspicion"".

"By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Tokyo In 2020, for the first time in 11 years, suicide rates in Japan went up. Most surprising, while male suicides fell slightly, rates among women surged nearly 15%. In one month, October, the female suicide rate in Japan went up by more than 70%, compared with the same month in the previous year. What is going on? And why does the Covid pandemic appear to be hitting women so much worse than men? Warning: Some may find the content of this story upsetting Meeting face-to-face with a young woman who has repeatedly tried to kill herself is a troubling experience. It has given me new respect for those who work on suicide prevention. I am sitting in a walk-in centre in Yokohama's red-light district, run by a suicide prevention charity called the Bond Project. Across the table is a 19-year-old woman, with bobbed hair. She sits motionless. Quietly, without any emotion, she starts to tell me her story. It started when she was 15, she says. Her older brother began violently abusing her. Eventually she ran away from home, but it didn't end the pain and the loneliness. Ending her life seemed the only way out. ""From about this time last year I have been in and out of hospital many times,"" she tells me. ""I tried many times to kill myself, but I couldn't succeed, so now I guess I have given up trying to die."" What stopped her was the intervention of the Bond Project. They found her a safe place to live, and began giving her intensive counselling. Jun Tachibana is the founder of the Bond Project. She is a tough woman in her 40s with relentless optimism. ""When girls are in real trouble and in pain, they really don't know what to do,"" she says. ""We are here, ready to listen to them, to tell them - we are here with you."" Ms Tachibana says Covid seems to be pushing those who are already vulnerable closer to the edge. She describes some of the harrowing calls her staff have received in recent months. ""We hear lots of 'I want to die' and 'I have no place to go',"" she says. ""They say 'It is so painful, I am so lonely I want to disappear'."" For those suffering physical or sexual abuse, Covid has made the situation much worse. ""A girl I talked to the other day said she is getting sexually harassed by her father,"" Ms Tachibana tells me. ""But because of Covid her father is not working so much and is at home a lot, so there is no escape from him."" A 'very unusual' pattern If you look at previous times of crisis in Japan, such as the 2008 banking crisis or the collapse of Japan's stock market and property bubble in the early 1990s, the impact was largely felt by middle aged men. Large spikes were seen in male suicide rates. But Covid is different, it is affecting young people and, in particular, young women. The reasons are complex. Japan used to have the highest suicide rate in the developed world. Over the last decade it has had great success in reducing suicide rates by around a third. Professor Michiko Ueda is one of Japan's leading experts on suicide. She tells me how shocking it has been to witness the sharp reverse in the last few months. ""This pattern of female suicides is very, very unusual,"" she tells me. ""I have never seen this much [of an] increase in my career as a researcher on this topic. The thing about the coronavirus pandemic is the industries hit most are industries staffed by women, such as tourism and retail and the food industries."" Japan has seen a large rise in single women living alone, many of them choosing that over marriage which entails quite traditional gender roles still. Prof Ueda says young women are also far more likely to be in so-called precarious employment. ""A lot of women are not married anymore,"" she says. ""They have to support their own lives and they don't have permanent jobs. So, when something happens, of course, they are hit very, very hard. The number of job losses among non-permanent staff are just so, so large over the last eight months."" One month really stands out. In October last year, 879 women killed themselves. That is more than 70% higher than the same month in 2019. Newspaper headlines sounded the alarm. Some compared the total number of suicides by men and women in October (2,199) to the total number of deaths in Japan from Coronavirus up to that point (2,087). Something particularly strange was happening. On 27 September last year, a very famous and popular actress named Yuko Takeuchi was found dead at her home. It was later reported that she had taken her own life. Yasuyuki Shimizu is a former journalist who now runs a non-profit organisation (NPO) dedicated to combatting Japan's suicide problem. ""From the day the news of a celebrity suicide is reported, the number of suicides increases and stays that way for about 10 days,"" he says. ""From the data we can see that the suicide of the actress on 27 September led to an extra 207 female suicides in the next 10 days."" If you look at the data for suicides by women around the same age as Yuko Takeuchi, the statistics are even more stark. ""Women in their 40s were most influenced out of all the age groups,"" Mr Shimizu says. ""For that group it (the suicide rate) more than doubled."" Other experts agree that there is a very strong connection between celebrity suicides and an immediate uptick in suicides in the days following. The celebrity phenomenon This phenomenon is not unique to Japan, and it is one reason why reporting on suicide is so difficult. In the immediate aftermath of a celebrity suicide, the more it is discussed in the media, and on social media, the greater the impact on other vulnerable people. One of the NPO's researchers is Mai Suganuma. She is herself a victim of suicide. When she was a teenager, her father took his own life. Now she helps to support the families of others who have killed themselves. And just as Covid is leaving relatives unable to grieve for those who have succumbed to the virus, so it is making life for the families of suicide victims much more difficult. ""When I talk to the family members, their feeling of not being able to save the loved one is very strong, which often results in them blaming themselves."" Mai Suganuma tells me. ""I too blamed myself for not being able to save my father. ""Now they are being told they must stay at home. I worry the feelings of guilt will grow stronger. Japanese people don't talk about death to begin with. We do not have a culture to talk about the suicides."" Japan is now in a so-called third wave of Covid infections, and the government has ordered a second state of emergency. It is likely to be extended well into February. More restaurants and hotels and bars are closing their doors. More people are losing their jobs. For Prof Ueda there is another nagging question. If this is happening in Japan, with no strict lockdowns, and relatively few Covid deaths, then what is happening in other countries where the pandemic is much worse? If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support can be found at this BBC Action Line. If you are in Japan you can contact the Bond Project, Japan Suicide Countermeasures Promotion Center or Life link.","Japan reports suicides faster and more accurately than anywhere else in the world. Unlike most countries, here they are compiled at the end of every month. During the Covid pandemic the numbers have told a disturbing story."
"Manal al-Sharif has led a campaign to remove bans on women driving in the oil-rich country for the past year. Her open letter urges King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz to permit women with foreign licences to drive. Last year Mrs Sharif was jailed after she posted a video of herself driving in the Saudi city of Khobar on YouTube. Her letter comes on the same day that hundreds of Saudi women signed a petition in support of women driving to mark the first anniversary of the start of the Women2Drive internet campaign, which was prompted by Mrs Sharif's arrest. Reformist stance Mrs Sharif praised some of the steps the King has taken to improve women's rights. She said banning women from getting behind the wheel was a result of of customs and traditions, and not to do with God. Since he ascended the throne in 2005, King Abdullah has been widely seen as trying to strike a reformist stance in the traditional Sunni Islamic country. In September last year he granted women the right to vote and take part in municipal elections. Other signatories to Wednesday's petition include a woman who was sentenced to 10 lashes after driving her car in Jeddah. King Abdullah later intervened and had the sentence overturned. Rights groups such as Human Rights Watch have criticised the country for having an opaque justice system and passing draconian sentences.",A women's rights activist in Saudi Arabia has written to the Saudi king repeating demands to allow women to drive.
"But 10 bronze figures have now gone on display in the eastern German city of Chemnitz to protest against what organisers see as ""growing hatred"". Tensions have risen in the city in recent weeks after a German man was allegedly killed by two migrants. Far-right protesters reportedly used the Hitler salute and chased migrants and journalists. The organisers of the sculpture The Wolves are Back explain that the installation is based on the fact that both the Nazis and current-day right-wing radicals often describe themselves as ""wolves"". The wolves were created by artist Rainer Opolka and will be in front of Chemnitz's iconic Karl Marx statue until Thursday evening, together with signs accusing right-wing groups of ""exploiting our fears"" and describing right-wing radicalism as ""the mother of all problems"". Some of the figures are ready to attack, while others are blindfolded. The wolf statues were previously displayed outside a court in Munich during the sentencing of Beate Zschäpe, a member of a neo-Nazi gang who was found guilty of 10 racially-motivated murders in July, as well as in Berlin and Dresden. It is not the first anti-racism event in Chemnitz. More than 60,000 attended a free concert in the city last week to protest against the far-right.","In a country where Nazi symbols are illegal, the sight of snarling wolves performing a Hitler salute is unusual."
"By Will GrantBBC News So when employees at the US-owned Regal motor factory organised a demonstration over having to work during a coronavirus outbreak, Mariana - not her real name - was initially reluctant to take part. Earning barely $80 (£64) a month, she can ill afford to become unemployed at this complicated time. According to Mariana, several workers in the factory died after contracting Covid-19 and that was when she decided that the issue at stake was too important to stay quiet. ""Someone who worked very close to us had a high temperature and they sent him home. Six days later he died. And now others have high temperatures,"" Mariana told me on the telephone from Ciudad Juárez. ""We can't risk bringing the virus home. In my case, I have a family member who's diabetic, another with asthma. I'm trying to think of them."" Conditions inside the assembly plants, called maquiladoras, are not conducive to preventing the spread of the virus, says Mariana. ""There isn't much distance between us on the assembly line and if a machine breaks, they put us all on the same one, right on top of each other."" The BBC approached Regal for comment but the company did not respond. On its website, Regal says it is ""working tirelessly to maintain healthy and safe workplaces all around the world"" amid the pandemic. The strike appeared to have the desired effect. The staff at the Regal factory in Ciudad Juárez were told to stay at home on full pay. Elsewhere in the border city, employees at the ECI electrical goods company also held a protest. Only maquiladoras producing ""essential goods"" are allowed to remain open following a federal government decree. One employee, Monserrat, told Reuters news agency that ECI staff did not think the ""essential"" label should apply to the goods they make. ""Are people desperate to buy refrigerators, stoves or washing machines right now?"" she asked. ""Of course they're not. The most important thing right now is to be safe at home."" ECI has not commented. Official figures suggest that 13 factory employees in Ciudad Juárez have died with coronavirus. But a well-known activist for workers' rights in the city, Susana Prieto, says the true figure may be three times as high. ""There is real panic among the workers,"" she told me. ""The factories have flagrantly disobeyed the emergency public health decree because of the absence of authority from the president and the federal government."" Factories only started to close in Ciudad Juárez ""once the bodies started literally dropping in front of their eyes"", says Ms Prieto. With so many maquiladoras shuttered, the cross-border supply chain in North America has been crippled. It has prompted the National Association of Manufacturers in the US, a group comprised of scores of US manufacturing companies, to write to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to urge him to reclassify more industries as essential so their factories can operate again. The association's controversial call was echoed by the Trump Administration. The US Undersecretary of Defence for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord, said last week that she had contacted Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard ""to ask for help to reopen international suppliers there"". ""These companies are especially important for our US airframe production,"" she added. Mexico has now reached an agreement on reopening factories in the automotive industry in coordination with the US and Canada. Susana Prieto thinks that the emergency decree has given priority to the wrong products, those for export to the US, Britain, China and Korea, rather than those needed by Mexicans. While factories producing medical supplies and equipment and agricultural goods are obviously needed in this current crisis, she argues that production for exports for the US automobile or aerospace industries should not be exempt. ""These factories should be closed,"" she says, her voice rising in anger. ""But we live in no-man's land where the laws are made to be broken."" You may also be interested in: US Ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau believes a balance can be struck: ""It's possible and essential to look after the health of workers without destroying those [supply] chains,"" he wrote on Twitter recently. Perhaps, but there are some 300,000 factory workers in Ciudad Juárez. Given the poor conditions inside many maquiladoras, employees are understandably wary of going to work in the middle of a global pandemic. They know that the manual labour they perform is vital to the health of the economy on both sides of the border. It is just that right now their own health and that of their families is far more important to them.",Factory workers in Ciudad Juárez rarely go on strike. Their labour rights are so weak that participating in a protest can cost them their job.
"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - would help restore confidence in the sector. Australian banks have been embroiled in scandals in recent times. Mr Turnbull had resisted calls for a royal commission for more than a year, but faced mounting pressure from other parties and members of his government. ""The only way we can give all Australians a greater degree of assurance is a royal commission into misconduct into the financial services industry,"" he said. He said the ""regrettable but necessary"" decision would also help the nation's economy by restoring confidence. The royal commission will cover the entire financial industry, including superannuation providers, insurers and financial advisers. The year-long inquiry will cost A$75m (£42m; $56m) and hand down findings in February 2019, the government said. Recent scandals Australian banks have faced various allegations of misconduct in recent years, including over financial planning, rate-rigging and insurance fraud. In August, the nation's largest lender, Commonwealth Bank, was accused of ""serious and systemic"" breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Earlier on Thursday, the heads of the four largest banks - Commonwealth Bank, NAB, ANZ and Westpac - co-signed a letter in which they reversed their long-held opposition to an inquiry. ""Our banks have consistently argued the view that further inquiries into the sector, including a royal commission, are unwarranted,"" the letter said. ""However, it is now in the national interest for the political uncertainty to end."" They reiterated acknowledgements that they had ""made mistakes"", but did not detail them in the letter. Mr Turnbull said the inquiry would examine responses to misconduct scandals and whether institutions had governance or culture problems. He described banks as the ""bedrock of the economy"", representing more than a third of Australia's stock market value. 'Dragged kicking and screaming' Some supporters of the inquiry, including members of Mr Turnbull's government, said the announcement should have come sooner. Government MP George Christensen said the prime minister had been ""dragged kicking and screaming to this decision"". Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten accused Mr Turnbull of letting ""the rorts and rip-offs continue for more than 18 months"". In explaining his previous opposition to an inquiry, Mr Turnbull said the government had already taken recent measures to make the banking system more accountable. These included forcing industry chiefs to appear regularly before parliamentary committees, increasing regulatory powers, and imposing a A$6.2bn levy on the five biggest banks. Mr Turnbull said he had believed that confidence could be damaged by an inquiry, but it was now more important to resolve the debate definitively. In a description aimed at international markets, the government stressed that Australia's banks remained ""unquestionably strong"" in the current regulatory environment. The inquiry has the approval of the central Reserve Bank of Australia and industry regulators.","Australia will hold a royal commission inquiry into its banking and financial sector, the government has announced."
"Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he would urge foreign ministers next Monday to revise the EU's partnership deal with the Ukraine. The new law makes Ukrainian-language lessons mandatory in secondary schools. The Transcarpathia region of western Ukraine is home to about 150,000 ethnic Hungarians. Mr Szijjarto's comments came after he met with Hungarians in the region. The government provides funds for Hungarian-language schools based there. He said the law violated the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, a deal to remove trade barriers between the two entities which went into force last month. ""Next Monday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg I will propose that the association agreement be reviewed,"" he added. National sensitivities The new law has also drawn criticism - though less strident - from Poland, Romania and Russia. Ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine who reject the Kiev government say they are protecting their Russian language and traditions from Ukrainian nationalists. Ukrainian language set for media boost Ukraine bans Russian films in media war Ukraine bans 38 Russian 'hate' books Ukraine says the new law complies fully with European norms on minority rights. It has asked the Council of Europe for an expert legal opinion on it. Previously Hungary had backed Ukraine's push for closer ties with the EU, including a deal on visa-free travel for Ukrainians to the Schengen zone, which covers most of Europe. Schengen removed most passport controls inside the EU. Under the law, signed by President Petro Poroshenko on 25 September, ethnic minority children will continue being taught in their mother tongue at primary school. But currently most Hungarian children in Transcarpathia continue with lessons almost entirely in Hungarian at secondary school, Zhanna Bezpiatchuk of BBC Ukrainian says. While most lessons will now be in Ukrainian, secondary schools in the region will still be able to teach some major subjects in Hungarian, she said. Often Hungarian children in Ukraine do just three hours of Ukrainian a week in primary school and many are not fluent in the language. ""We are confident that the provisions of this law do not violate national or international law, nor our international obligations,"" said Ukraine's ambassador to Hungary, Lubov Nepop.","Hungary says it will protest to the EU over a new law that limits the teaching of subjects in languages of Ukraine's ethnic minorities, including Hungarian."
"Militants who declared allegiance to the so-called Islamic State took over parts of Marawi on the island of Mindanao more than three weeks ago. Most residents have fled but several hundred are thought to be trapped. A Philippine military spokesman said he could not give a timeframe for freeing the southern city from militants. Early on Tuesday, the group of 10 people - five police officers and five construction workers who had been hiding for 22 days - ran 2km (1.25 miles) under fire to safety. The policemen, all Muslims, told local media they refused to leave the workers - who were Christians - behind. One of them, officer Lumna Lidasan, said: ""We could have escaped and disguised ourselves because we are Muslims"". ""But I thought that we could not leave them because they could not speak the local dialect. I know that they will be killed."" One of the construction workers said he was wounded by cement splinters caused by sniper bullets. ""We crawled because snipers were shooting at us,"" Reuters quoted Mateo Velasquez as saying. In a separate incident, a presidential spokesman said five civilians were killed when militants discovered their hiding place. ""They were going to the river but the militants ran after them and indiscriminately fired at them, killing five and taking the remaining eight as hostages,"" Ernesto Abella said. 'No options' The government had set a deadline of Monday to retake the city. But asked when fighting would end, military spokesman Brig Gen Restituto Padilla said he could not give ""a very accurate estimate because of compounding developments faced by ground commanders"". He said the urban terrain and the risk of militants using civilians as human shields were hampering troops. The militants claim they are holding two-thirds of the city but the military deny this, saying it is likely to be around 20%, Reuters news agency reports. According to the government, at least 26 civilians, 58 police or soldiers and 202 militants have been killed since the fighting began. The city was home to 200,000 residents. Most have fled but those who are trapped are facing violence and a lack of food and water. The Red Cross said it had been trying unsuccessfully to get the two sides to create a corridor through which civilians could leave, AFP news agency reported. The violence in Marawi began when the army failed in its attempt to capture Isnilon Hapilon, believed to be the main IS leader in the Philippines and linked to the local Maute group, who have declared allegiance to IS. In response the Maute group attacked parts of the city, taking hostages. President Rodrigo Duterte then declared martial law on Mindanao.","Ten people ran through gunfire to escape fighting in a Philippine city seized by militants, as five more civilians deaths were reported."
"Kevin Lewis said that ""neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen"". Mr Trump had tweeted: ""Terrible! Just found out Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"" He gave no details to back the claim. In his statement, Mr Lewis said a ""cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice"". The statement left open the possibility that a judicial investigation was taking place. Earlier Ben Rhodes, who was Mr Obama's foreign policy adviser and speechwriter, also addressed Mr Trump's claims in a tweet, saying: ""No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you."" Mr Trump, who is at his Florida resort, fired off a series of tweets from just after 06:30 local time (11:30 GMT) on Saturday. He called the alleged tapping ""a new low"" and said ""This is Nixon/Watergate"" - referring to the most notorious political scandal of 1972, which led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon after a web of political spying, sabotage and bribery was exposed by the media. McCarthyism, which Mr Trump referred to in one of the first posts, relates to the persecution of US Communists and their allies led by Senator Joe McCarthy in the 1950s. In other developments on Saturday: Partisan maelstrom: Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington As the Trump administration continues to be bedevilled by a drip-drip of revelations about ties to Russian officials during and after last year's election, the president has seemingly settled on the identity of the malevolent figure behind the turmoil. Barack Obama. It was the former president, Mr Trump asserts, who is guilty of meddling in the 2016 campaign, not Russia. Mr Obama, he says, is the one whose deeds merit investigation. The president's early morning tweets follow an interview on Tuesday in which he accused Mr Obama and ""his people"" of orchestrating recent political protests across the US and of being behind the government leaks that have embarrassed the White House. There is scant evidence supporting these allegations, but charges like these fit a pattern. Mr Trump is at his sharpest when pushing back against perceived antagonists, such as Republican primary opponents like Jeb Bush, establishment conservatives who resisted his nomination or Hillary Clinton in the election. Now Mr Trump is returning to his favourite political foil - a necessity given the current Democratic power vacuum in Washington. It could mark the beginning of a massive water-muddying effort in which any forthcoming investigatory revelations are swept up in a growing partisan maelstrom. Mr Trump's tweets followed allegations made by conservative radio host Mark Levin, which were later picked up by Breitbart News, the website run by Steve Bannon before he became chief Trump strategist. Mr Levin said there should be a congressional investigation into what he called President Obama's ""police state"" tactics in his last months in office to undermine Mr Trump's campaign. Breitbart summarises Mr Levin's accusations, which say that: Read more: Mr Trump has come under constant pressure from FBI and congressional investigations into alleged contacts between his aides and Russian officials during the election campaign. Media reports in the past few weeks have suggested a warrant was sought under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) last summer in order to monitor members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with the Russian officials. The warrant was first turned down but then approved in October, according to the reports. There has been no official confirmation and it is also not clear if this evolved into a full investigation. What is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa)? Some Democrats feel Mr Trump's latest tweets are an attempt to focus attention away from the Russian affair. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said: ""The Deflector-in-Chief is at it again.""","President Donald Trump's accusation that his predecessor ordered his phones to be tapped is ""simply false"", Barack Obama's spokesman has said."
"It take its name from the town of Schengen in Luxembourg, where the agreement was signed in 1985. It took effect in 1995. Which countries are part of the agreement? The first member states were Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Now there are 26 Schengen countries - 22 EU members and four non-EU. Those four are Iceland and Norway (since 2001), Switzerland (since 2008) and Liechtenstein (since 2011). After the initial five came Italy (1990), Portugal and Spain (1991), Greece (1992), Austria (1995), and Denmark, Finland and Sweden in 1996. Nine more EU countries joined in 2007, after the EU's eastward enlargement in 2004. They are: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Only six of the 28 EU member states are outside the Schengen zone - Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania and the UK. The EU explains the evolution of Schengen here. Are other countries going to remove border checks too? Andorra and San Marino are not part of Schengen, but they no longer have checks at their borders. There is no date yet for Cyprus, which joined the EU in 2004, or for Bulgaria and Romania (joined in 2007) or Croatia (joined in 2013). Which EU countries are not in Schengen? The UK and Republic of Ireland have opted out. The UK wants to maintain its own borders, and Dublin prefers to preserve its free movement arrangement with the UK - called the Common Travel Area - rather than join Schengen. The UK and Ireland began taking part in some aspects of the Schengen agreement, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS), from 2000 and 2002 respectively. The SIS enables police forces across Europe to share data on law enforcement. It includes data on stolen cars, court proceedings and missing persons. How have the Paris attacks and the migrant crisis affected Schengen? Schengen is often criticised by nationalists and Eurosceptics who say it is an open door for migrants and criminals. The 13 November Paris attacks, which killed 130 people, prompted an urgent rethink of the Schengen agreement. There was alarm that killers had so easily slipped into Paris from Belgium, and that some had entered the EU with crowds of migrants via Greece. In 2015, the influx of more than a million migrants - many of them Syrian refugees - also greatly increased the pressure on politicians, and one after another, EU states re-imposed temporary border controls. In December, the European Commission proposed a major amendment to Schengen, expected to become law soon. Most non-EU travellers have their details checked against police databases at the EU's external borders. The main change is that the rule will apply to EU citizens as well, who until now had been exempt. Non-EU nationals who have a Schengen visa generally do not have ID checks once they are travelling inside the zone, but since the Paris atrocity those checks have become more common. When can countries re-impose border controls? Under the Schengen rules, signatories may reinstate internal border controls for 10 days, if this has to be done immediately for ""public policy or national security"" reasons. If the problem continues, the controls can be maintained for ""renewable periods"" of up to 20 days and for a maximum of two months. The period is longer in cases where the threat is considered ""foreseeable"". The controls can be maintained for renewable periods of up to 30 days, and for a maximum of six months. An extension of two years maximum is allowed under Article 26 of the Schengen Borders Code, in ""exceptional circumstances"". In the Schengen zone, currently six states have border controls in place: Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Hungary's controls affect its borders with two non-Schengen states: Croatia and Serbia. Last October it also imposed temporary controls on the border with Schengen member Slovenia. In 2005 France re-imposed border controls after the bomb attacks by Islamist militants in London. Austria, Portugal and Germany re-imposed border controls for some major sporting events, such as the Fifa World Cup. What else does Schengen involve? The main feature is the creation of a single external border, and a single set of rules for policing the border, but there are other measures including: How are non-EU citizens affected? Nationals from some countries need to obtain a Schengen visa in order to enter one of its member countries or travel within the area. It is a short-stay visa valid for 90 days. It also allows international transit at airports in Schengen countries. A short-stay visa costs €60 (£46; $66), but just €35 for Russians, Ukrainians and citizens of some other countries, under visa facilitation agreements.","The Schengen Agreement abolished many of the EU's internal borders, enabling passport-free movement across most of the bloc."
"On the morning of 17 January, Muhammad Yusuf Pujwala was sitting outside his home in Kathua when one of his neighbours came running towards him. He stopped in front of Mr Pujwala and broke the news: they had found his eight-year-old daughter, Asifa Bano. Her body lay in bushes in the forest, a few hundred metres away. ""I knew something horrible had happened to my girl,"" Mr Pujwala, a 52-year-old with deep sunken eyes, told the BBC in an interview recently. His wife, Naseema Bibi, sat beside him, faintly crying while repeatedly murmuring ""Asifa"". Mr Pujwala belongs to a community of Muslim nomadic shepherds called Gujjars who crisscross the Himalayas with their goats and buffaloes. The crime has shocked the community, exposing the fault lines between Hindu-majority Jammu and the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley in a sharply divided state. The Kashmir valley has a tumultuous relationship with India - there has been an armed revolt in the region against Indian rule since 1989. Police have arrested eight men, including a retired government official, four police officers and a juvenile in connection with Asifa's death. However, the arrests sparked protests in Jammu - lawyers tried to stop police entering the court to file a charge sheet and two ministers from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attended a rally in support of the accused. The BJP rules the state in a coalition with the regional People's Democratic Party (PDP). How did Asifa disappear? When she went missing on 10 January, her family was living in a village around 72km (45 miles) east of Jammu city. On that afternoon, her mother recalls, Asifa went to the forest to bring home the horses. The horses returned but Asifa did not. Ms Naseema informed her husband. He and some neighbours started looking for her. Armed with flash lights, lanterns and axes, they went deep into the forest and searched through the night. But they could not find her. Two days later, on 12 January, the family filed a police complaint. But, according to Mr Pujwala, the police were not helpful. One of the police officers, he alleges, said Asifa must have ""eloped"" with a boy. As news of the crime spread, Gujjar staged protests and blocked a highway, forcing police to assign two officers for the search. One of those who was assigned, Deepak Khajuria, was himself arrested in connection with the crime. Five days later, Asifa's body was found. ""She had been tortured. Her legs were broken,"" recalled Ms Naseema, who had rushed to the forest along with her husband to see the body. ""Her nails had turned black and there were blue and red marks on her arm and fingers."" What do investigators believe happened? On 23 January, six days after Asifa's body was found, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, ordered a investigation by the crime branch, a special unit of the state police. According to the investigators, Asifa was confined in a local temple for several days and given sedatives that kept her unconscious. The charge sheet alleges that she was ""raped for days, tortured and then finally murdered"". She was strangled to death and then hit on the head twice with a stone. Sanji Ram, a 60-year-old retired government officer, allegedly planned the crime with the help of police officers Surender Verma, Anand Dutta, Tilak Raj and Mr Khajuria. Mr Ram's son, Vishal, his nephew, a juvenile, and his friend, Parvesh Kumar, are also accused over the rape and murder. Investigators allege that Mr Khajuria and the other police officers - some of whom lodged the complaint and accompanied the family in the search - washed Asifa's bloodied and mud-spattered clothes before sending them to a forensic lab. They believe that the accused men wished to terrorise the Gujjar community into leaving Jammu. The shepherds use public and forest land in Jammu for grazing, which has recently brought them into conflict with some Hindu residents in the region. ""It was about land,"" said Talib Hussain, a tribal rights activist and lawyer. Mr Hussain, who led a protest in support of Asifa's family, alleges he was arrested and threatened by local police. Ankur Sharma, one of the lawyers who protested on behalf of the accused, alleged that the Muslim nomads were trying to alter the demographics of Jammu, where Hindus are currently the majority. ""They are encroaching our forests and water resources,"" he told the BBC. He said the accused had been falsely implicated while the real culprits were still free. While the crime did not receive much attention in Jammu, newspapers in Srinagar, the capital city located in the Kashmir valley, carried the story on their front pages. In Jammu and Kashmir state assembly, Mian Altaf, an influential Gujjar leader and an opposition legislator, waved the newspapers with photographs of Asifa while demanding an inquiry. Rajiv Jasrotia, a BJP lawmaker, said the incident was a ""family matter"" and blamed Mr Altaf for politicising the crime. What happened at Asifa's funeral? The Gujjars wanted to bury Asifa in a graveyard where they had purchased some land a few years ago and had already buried five people. But when they arrived there, Mr Pujwala said, they were surrounded by Hindu right-wing activists who threatened them with violence if they were to continue with the burial. ""We had to walk seven miles to bury her in another village,"" Mr Pujwala said. Two of his daughters were killed in an accident some years ago. On his wife's insistence, he adopted Asifa, the daughter of his brother-in-law. His wife described Asifa as a ""chirping bird"" who ran like a ""deer"". When they travelled, she looked after the herd. ""That made her the darling of the community,"" Ms Bibi said. ""She was the centre of our universe.""","The brutal gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Indian-administered Kashmir has put the restive state on edge.

"By PJ CrowleyFormer US Assistant Secretary of State President Barack Obama had hoped that an alternative remedy might help him alleviate some of the Middle East pain he and his administration have felt in recent months. Alas, the test results are back - the pain is not going away and will actually become more acute and more difficult to manage during his remaining time in office. A major source of the pain is well established - Mr Obama's problematic relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pulled out a hard-fought electoral victory and appears to have the inside track to form a new Israeli government. The campaign produced complications that will undermine a crucial pillar of American policy in the Middle East, but in a different area than was anticipated just two weeks ago. Heading into the elections, the foremost issue for Israeli voters appeared to be the rising cost of living and expanding gap between rich and poor. Beneath the surface was the palpable tension between the Israeli prime minister and the US president, as well as its implications for the US-Israeli relationship and the broader region. US media reaction on Israeli election The New York Times' opinion page harshly criticises Mr Netanyahu's last-minute moves in the campaign - ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's outright rejection of a Palestinian state and his racist rant against Israeli Arab voters on Tuesday showed that he has forfeited any claim to representing all Israelis."" Slate's Joshua Keating likens the outcome to the 2013 Israeli election and Mr Netanyahu's split with former rival that set up this election - ""In other words, while Israeli voters may have chosen continuity, there's a good chance they'll be voting again pretty soon."" Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute writes at CNN that Mr Netayahu's re-election will make it more likely President Obama make ""even more concessions to ensure a deal between Tehran and Washington"". Confronting a tougher political battle battle than he anticipated, Mr Netanyahu made the election about security, primarily the threat posed by Iran. Breaking political protocol, he bypassed the White House and gave a controversial yet compelling speech before the US Congress regarding the danger of a ""bad deal"" from the ongoing P5+1 negotiations with Iran. Instead of an arrangement that would leave Iran with an active civilian nuclear capability and what he viewed as an unacceptably short leap to a weapon, Mr Netanyahu advocated for the status quo - keep sanctions on Iran until it started acting like a ""normal country"". Reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran has arguably been Mr Obama's highest foreign policy priority. The president does not see the current situation as sustainable, with indefinite isolation or confrontation making an Iranian nuclear weapon more likely, not less. Mr Netanyahu's election does not materially impact the prospects of an agreement. They are complicated enough in their own right as Washington and its negotiating partners attempt to thread an incredibly tight needle while overcoming decades of mistrust on all sides. Given that Mr Obama was already confronting bipartisan scepticism and is constructing a prospective agreement that Congress can criticise but not stop - even with the documented opposition of 47 senators - Mr Netanyahu will ultimately have to live with whatever Mr Obama does. From an American standpoint, Mr Netanyahu should have stopped there. He didn't. Over the weekend, he made explicit what many, particularly the Palestinians, had long believed. As long as he is prime minister, there will not be a Palestinian state. He even acknowledged that his administration used settlement construction to undermine the process. These statements sent a moribund peace process into freefall, calling into question the future of the Oslo process. But in his political desperation, Mr Netanyahu gave some unexpected (and from an American standpoint profoundly unhelpful) ammunition to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The Palestinians have long argued that, notwithstanding Mr Netanyahu's 2009 speech at Bar Ilan University grudgingly accepting the two-state solution, that he had no intention of ever reaching an agreement with the Palestinians. Assuming Mr Netanyahu forms a government, that becomes Israel's de facto policy. The European Union has called for a resumption of the peace process, but there is no longer a credible foundation for such a step. This leaves the Palestinians free to challenge Israel through various United Nations organisations. Attempts to de-legitimise Israel through the UN scores political points but doesn't move the Palestinians closer to an actual state. This further isolates Israel internationally, but it is at present a price it consciously decided to pay. The deadlock leaves Mr Obama with a chronic pain that, as with his recent predecessors, he will bequeath to the next occupant of the White House.

"Ankara is battling to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The French offer was swiftly dismissed by a Turkish presidential spokesman. Ibrahim Kalin said countries should instead take a ""clear stance against all types of terrorism"". Separately on Friday, Turkey said five soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack by the PKK in the south-eastern province of Siirt. The attack, the deadliest by the PKK for months, is likely to be in revenge for Turkey's offensive in northern Syria, BBC Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen reports. What's behind the French offer? President Emmanuel Macron had met members of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), including the YPG and expressed hopes for dialogue between Turkey and the militia. His office said he had ""paid tribute to the sacrifices and the determining role"" of the SDF in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group. The SDF is a key US ally in the fight against IS and the Kurdish YPG forms a core part of it. France and the US have given the militia weapons and training to support its battle against IS. The US also backs the YPG's assertion that it has no direct organisational links to the PKK, which Turkey calls a terror group. The president said France would support the ""stabilisation"" of the security zone in north-east Syria to stop IS regaining strength. Kurdish officials said Mr Macron had committed himself to sending more troops to the area but Paris declined to comment on that. France has suffered a series of deadly terror attacks claimed by IS in recent years, including the Paris attacks which killed 130 people in 2015. A week ago an IS sympathiser killed three people in a rampage in southern France, including a police officer who died after swapping places with a hostage. What was Turkey's response? Mr Kalin replied on Twitter, restating the Turkish position that the PKK and YPG were trying to legitimise themselves under the SDF. He wrote: ""We reject any efforts to promote 'dialogue', 'contact' or 'mediation' between Turkey and those terrorist organisations."" He said ""friendly countries"" should not ""legitimise the structure of terror"". How dangerous is the conflict in northern Syria? Earlier this month Turkey ousted Kurdish fighters from the Syrian-Kurdish city of Afrin. Activists said 280 civilians had been killed, although this was denied by Ankara. As many as a quarter of a million civilians are said to have fled the city. Turkey has since threatened to attack the SDF-controlled town of Manbij, which was taken from IS in 2016 - and where the US has stationed troops. The Turkish national security council issued an ultimatum on Wednesday, saying it would act if Kurdish fighters did not leave immediately. Sebastian Usher, Middle East Editor for the BBC World Service, says the US dimension to the conflict does not appear to have been resolved as yet. There is no sign that American troops have pulled back from Manbij, where they helped the SDF in its successful campaign against IS, our correspondent reports.","France has offered to mediate in the conflict in northern Syria, where Turkey launched a military offensive against Kurdish fighters in January."

"Its 2011 annual report shows officers made 114 seizures with a total street value of £415,809, compared to 257 seizures valued at £191,732 in 2010. Andy Snell, an investigation officer, said illegal drugs commanded high street values in the island. He said this was why criminals tried to import commercial quantities. There was also a year-on-year rise in convictions, with 46 people convicted in cases involving the agency, of which 22 involved drug-related offences. The agency said it benefited the island's treasury by selling the assets seized from drug couriers, which last year included two boats. It also handles the collection of import duty on fuel, wines and sprits and tobacco and is responsible for enforcing immigration rules.

"By Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin Correspondent The country has been at Level Five, its highest level of restrictions, since Christmas. On 10 May, close-contact services such as hairdressers can reopen and click-and-collect retail can resume. From the same date, people can travel outside their own county for the first time in more than four months, and team sports training can resume. Up to 50 people will be allowed to attend weddings, funerals and other religious services. To allow grandparents meet their grandchildren and extended families, a vaccinated household can meet indoors with an unvaccinated one. From 17 May, all non-essential shops can reopen to customers. From 2 June, hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation will be permitted to trade. All pubs, regardless of whether they serve food, along with restaurants are set to open up for outdoor service on 7 June. 'Gradual, responsible reopening' Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin praised the public for obeying the lockdown rules during a ""very tough and unprecedented year"" but he added that continued cooperation was needed for the lockdown relations to proceed as planned. ""To enable all of this, the key factor remains sticking with the strategy - a gradual, responsible reopening with all of us observing the rules and respecting the guidance that remains in place,"" he said. ""Our choices and our individual behaviour remain key."" The taoiseach added that the government would keep a close eye on the effect that each rule change has on the spread of Covid-19. The relaxation is premised on containing the new variants of coronavirus and a massive acceleration of the vaccination programme which is way behind target and compares unfavourably with Northern Ireland's rate of vaccinations. Mr Martin said on Thursday that the vaccine rollout had faced some difficulties but was ""clearly the overriding priority"". ""No effort whatsoever will be spared to make sure that every vaccine we receive into the country is administered as quickly as possible"". He added that Covid-19 vaccines had been ""transformative"" in tackling the pandemic around the world and in the Republic of Ireland itself. ""Already, almost all of our most vulnerable are now protected and we can already see that the rates of death, serious illness, hospital admissions and infections in people who have been vaccinated have collapsed."" He said that although the Republic of Ireland's vaccine programme had faced ""a range of challenges"" including recent supply disruption, almost 30% of people aged over 16 have had one dose to date. Vaccine targets On Wednesday, the taoiseach told the Dáil (Irish parliament) that the government hoped it would ""get close"" to its target of having more than 80% of the population with a first vaccine dose by the end of June and 55% fully vaccinated. That requires an average of a million people to be vaccinated in April, May and June but ministers and officials concede that they now expect just over 700,000 jabs to be administered by the end of April.",The Irish government has announced a phased relaxation of its strict Covid-19 lockdown over the next six weeks.

"By Adam EastonBBC News, Torun, Poland LGBT+ rights have become the single biggest cultural issue in Poland's election campaign ahead of Sunday's vote. In the eyes of Jaroslaw Kaczynski's national-conservative party and the Catholic Church, those rights are a threat to traditional Polish families and values. Mr Kaczynski likes to identify threats to Polish society - during the election campaign four years ago, he said Middle Eastern migrants might bring ""parasites and protozoa"" to Poland. This time around, according to Mr Kaczynski, the threat comes from LGBT+ people and from Europe, where families can have ""two mummies or two daddies"", he said. Poland's 1997 constitution states that a marriage is between a man and a woman. Civil partnerships, be they between heterosexual or same-sex couples, are not legally recognised. ""Christianity is part of our national identity, the [Catholic] Church was and is the preacher and holder of the only commonly held system of values in Poland,"" he said. ""Outside of it… we have only nihilism."" Senior Catholic Church figures have gone further, most notably the Archbishop of Krakow, Marek Jedraszewski, who on numerous occasions has identified the ""LGBT lobby"" and ""gender ideology"" as the new threat to Polish freedom following the end of communism in 1989, calling it ""totalitarian"" and a ""great threat to our freedom"". Where Poland's main political groups stand on same-sex marriage The couple who came back to fight for change In the beautiful, medieval city of Torun, birthplace of the astronomer Copernicus, chef Mariusz Godlejewski rejected the notion that he was a threat. During more than a decade living in Ireland, Mariusz married his long-term partner Bartosz before the couple returned to their homeland last year. ""My husband and I have been together for 14 years. Who are we, two strangers living together? We are family as well,"" he said. ""Coming back here I knew what I was getting in to. I knew that I will lose all the rights with my husband we gained in Ireland but we wanted to come and help our friends to make the change."" Mariusz believes it is only a matter of time before things do change but finds the tone of political debate depressing. Last month, a professor from Torun's Copernicus University, Aleksander Nalaskowski, was suspended after he likened homosexuality to ""the plague"" and complained that gay men and women were demanding not only tolerance, but acceptance. Government-supporting circles argued his suspension was an abuse of free speech and he was subsequently reinstated. Spread of equality marches in Poland Mariusz was organising the third equality march in Torun, in which more than a thousand people walked through the city guarded on both sides by helmeted riot police carrying shields. A police water cannon I saw parked in the road was not required but violence has broken out during equality marches in the cities of Bialystok, where gangs of angry young men attacked parade participants, and in Lublin, where counter demonstrators clashed with police and two protesters were arrested after they reportedly brought homemade explosive devices. Poland remains more socially conservative than many countries in Western Europe but attitudes to LGBT+ issues are changing. Opinion poll based on sample of 1,000 people 57%Support same-sex civil partnerships 55%Against gay marriage 80%Oppose adoption of children by same-sex couples There are more and more equality marches, 32 this year compared to 13 last year. Most, like the one in Torun, are joyful, peaceful events. 'They have to be aware they are sinners' Underneath a statue of Copernicus in the city centre, a small counter demonstration gathered before the equality march. There were several members of the far-right National Radical Camp, holding their green and white flags emblazoned with a falanga sword, which is associated with fascism. There were also banners warning about how the ""LGBT lobby"" wants to teach pre-schoolers how to masturbate, above the slogan ""Stop paedophilia"". There was also a photo of an equality parade showing two male marchers holding a rainbow flag from behind, their bare buttocks pixellated. Some people held crosses and handed out white, plastic rosary beads before prayers were said for the souls of the equality march participants. ""Everyone has the same rights. For example, they have the same right to marry. I can marry my girlfriend, they can also marry their girlfriends, but they want to marry the same sex,"" organiser and teacher Radoslaw Duch said. ""We don't want to arrest them, we don't want to get rid of them. They have to be aware they are sinners. Me as a Catholic person, I want to show them a better path of their life,"" he added. If opinion polls are correct, PiS should win the October 13 election comfortably. Attitudes in Poland may be changing, but if Mr Kaczynski's party does win a second term, there seems little chance that homosexual couples will enjoy the same rights as their heterosexual neighbours any time soon.","""We consider two communities fundamental, the family as one man, one woman and the children,"" said the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) at a recent convention."
"There were no clashes reported as more than 400 officers entered the favelas before dawn on Monday. The Pope is expected for the Roman Catholic celebration of World Youth Day, from 23 to 28 July. The occupation is part of a government policy of combating drug crime ahead of the upcoming World Cup and Olympics. All three slum districts - Cerro-Cora, Vila Candido and Guararapes - were built on the hillsides around the Corcovado mountain, topped by the statue of Christ, one of the city's best loved tourist attractions. After marching in, the security forces searched the favelas for drugs and weapons, finding ammunition, radio transmitters and marijuana. No one was arrested, the authorities said. 'Security belt' Rio's security chief, Jose Mariano Beltrame, said the occupation sealed a ""security belt"" around the Tijuca mountain range, host to one of the world's biggest urban forests. ""The planning and installation of UPPs follows the 2008 plan. The UPP at Cerro-Cora is part of the occupation of the Sao Carlos [favela], which occurred in 2009,"" Mr Beltrame told reporters. The operation started at 05:00 local time (08:00 GMT) and after just 30 minutes the officers began to look for a visible place to set up poles for the Brazilian and Rio de Janeiro flags. The drive to push out drug dealers from poorer communities in Rio started in 2008, inspired by a similar programme in Colombia. The first favela to be occupied by security forces was Dona Marta, which is also on a hillside around the famous statue. Since then, more than 30 slum districts have introduced the so called UPPs, or Pacifying Police Units. Each of these units is staffed by more than 100 officers, who police the communities around it. The governor of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio Cabral, has vowed to bring the number up to 40 by the end of 2014.","Police in Brazil have occupied three shanty towns around Rio de Janeiro's famous Christ the Redeemer statue, ahead of a visit by Pope Francis."
"By Reality Check teamBBC News Also known as the gum tree, these forests are some of the most flammable in the world. How do eucalyptus trees spread fires? Eucalyptus trees cover more than three-quarters of Australia's forested area and almost all of the hundreds of species are native to the island nation. Strips of bark that hang off the trunk and the branches can ignite and carry a fire up the tree and can spread through the forest on the wind. ""When the bark ignites it can be blown great distances, starting new fires,"" says Dr Jane Cawson, an expert in vegetation flammability at the University of Melbourne. This process, called spotting, can ignite fires 30km (18 miles) ahead of the main fire and is very difficult to suppress. ""The trees themselves exacerbate the fires mostly through spotting,"" says Dr Cawson. Some gum tree leaves contain oil that can also ignite easily and burn quickly. There is also the vegetation on the floor of a eucalyptus forest, which tends to readily catch fire. Over time they have adapted to their environment where drought and fires are common, and the trees themselves are usually very resilient. Some species have developed the ability to survive, and recover, from bushfires and soon resprout through buds that lie dormant. Burning also releases seeds from their capsules stored in the canopy which can also aid the regeneration process. However, new research shows that if the same patch of forest is burned by high-intensity fire more than once over a short period of time, which has happened in Australia, even the most resilient species of eucalyptus may struggle to recover. Is there an alternative to eucalyptus? These natural forests, often in protected areas, provide a habitat for huge numbers of plant and animal species. ""There is no public discussion [in Australia] about replacing them with alternative species,"" says Dr Cawson. Aboriginal communities have used the tree for a multitude of practical purposes from crafting tools to using the oil as medicine. However, there are debates about how to look after the forests to prevent fires spreading. One of these options is prescribed burning, and there has been a political row about whether more of this ""controlled burning"" as a means to stop fires spreading should have been done. Other countries have gum trees too The main species that has been exported and planted widely outside of Australia is the Eucalyptus globulus. ""It's actually one of the less flammable eucalyptus trees, but it is nevertheless much more flammable than some of the native landcover it has replaced,"" says Stefan Doerr, an expert in wildfires at Swansea University. These trees have contributed to wildfires in California and Portugal, which suffers from some of the worst fires in Europe. The eucalyptus was regarded as being one of the main reasons fires were so deadly in Portugal in 2017. They are grown for paper across large areas of the central and northern parts of the country. At the time, an environmental group said the fires reflected a ""situation of negligence"" and criticised the mass replacement of pine trees with eucalyptus trees. Elsewhere eucalyptus trees are commonly used for reforesting and commercial purposes because they are fast-growing, despite ecologists warning they can be bad for native species. These varieties are often bred to be more productive and are much less of a fire hazard, says Fangyuan Hua, a conservation ecologist based at Peking University in China. ""These 'tree farms' are typically under fairly careful management which can lower their fire risk,"" she said.

"The MV Butiraoi went missing nearly two weeks ago with 50 people on board. The eight people were picked up by a fishing boat after they were spotted from air in a small dinghy, the New Zealand Defence Force said. Search operations continued on Monday with rescuers saying there may yet be more survivors out at sea. New Zealand and Fiji are among the countries assisting in the search and rescue operation. A New Zealand military plane had found the 5m (16ft) dinghy adrift on Sunday morning. The New Zealand Defence Force had initially given the number of survivors on board as seven. The crew had airdropped essential supplies and radio equipment to the survivors. Later on Sunday, the group were picked up by a fishing vessel. John Ashby, from the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre, said the dinghy was one of two believed to have been carried by the MV Butiraoi. ""The group seem very relieved to have been found,"" he added, noting that sea conditions were ""moderate to rough"". No further details about the fate of the 17.5m (57ft) wooden catamaran or its other passengers were given.

"The man, identified as Kong, had researched the packaging designs of real vaccines before making more than 58,000 of his own concoctions. A batch of the vaccines were smuggled overseas, but it is not known where they were sent to. Kong is among 70 people who have been arrested for similar crimes. The arrests, involving more than 20 cases, came as Beijing vowed to crack down on fraudulent vaccines. Even though most of the cases surfaced late last year, new details were released this week. According to a court ruling, Kong and his team made a profit of 18m yuan ($2.78m; £2m) by putting saline solution or mineral water in syringes and hawking them as Covid vaccines since August last year. A batch of 600 of these vaccines were sent to Hong Kong last November, before they were shipped abroad. The sales were made on the basis the vaccines were acquired via ""internal channels"" of genuine manufacturers. In other cases, counterfeit vaccines were sold at inflated prices in hospitals.

"This means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought. Dr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19. The patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad. Knowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak. The French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary. France is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago, a post-mortem examination carried out in California revealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought. What do we know about the new case? Dr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris. He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear. The patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus. This was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Mr Hammar told French broadcaster BFMTV that he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms. But Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that ""often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases"". ""We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic,"" Dr Cohen said. What does it tell us? Could coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas. How does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing. But it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan. Certainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease. Why does it matter? Until now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member. Mr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier. The first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January. Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere. ""It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short,"" Prof Kao said. How was the new case found? Dr Cohen told the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January. He found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19. He said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19. A full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added.","A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said."
"Gardaí (Irish police) were called to a house in Llywellen Court in Ballinteer at about 12:00 local time on Wednesday. RTÉ News has reported that the bodies are believed to be of a mother and two children. The Irish broadcaster said officers forced their way inside the property at the Llewellyn estate after neighbours became concerned. Gardaí said they were investigating ""the circumstances of the unexplained deaths"". Garda Supt Paul Reidy said a post-mortem examination was due to be carried out, the results of which will ""determine the course of the investigation"". Gardaí also appealed for members of the public not to circulate comments about the case on social media platforms, describing them as uninformed and unhelpful to the investigation. The services of the Garda Technical Bureau were requested and the scene will undergo a technical examination, the force said. The state pathologist has also been informed and will attend the scene.","The bodies of a 37-year-old woman, an 11-year-old girl and six-year-old boy have been found at a house in Dublin."
"The opposition called for a campaign of civil disobedience including a national strike, which began on Sunday. Four people were killed after security forces fired tear gas and live ammunition. Monday remained quiet in Khartoum although some businesses started to reopen and a few buses were running. In another development, three rebel leaders have been deported from the city to South Sudan. One of the three, Yasir Arman, had only returned to Sudan last month after years in exile after he was sentenced to death in absentia. Most shops, markets and banks in the capital, as well as in several other cities, remained closed on Monday as staff followed instructions from the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the pro-democracy opposition, to not attend work. The SPA called the strike after more than 100 peaceful protesters were killed by a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), on 3 June. ""The civil disobedience movement will begin Sunday and end only when a civilian government announces itself in power on state television,"" the SPA said in a statement. ""Disobedience is a peaceful act capable of bringing to its knees the most powerful weapons arsenal in the world."" Protesters have set up roadblocks across the capital. Social media users with access to a connection reported that the country's internet was blocked by the ruling military government. What's the background? The military ousted long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April following months of protests against him. A military council promised a transition to civilian rule. But pro-democracy campaigners say the military council cannot be trusted after Monday's crackdown against a sit-in demonstration in Khartoum - and they have rejected an offer of talks.",Sudanese workers are refusing to go to work in an attempt to pressurise the ruling military government to make way for civilian rule.
"The vessel, which has been out of service for three days, was repaired at Cammell Laird shipyard. The Steam Packet Company said repairs were made to the bow thrust unit which was damaged earlier this year after the vessel ingested debris. The Ben-my-Chree's next journey from Heysham to Douglas will be a freight-only service at 0215 on Tuesday. It is then scheduled to resume normal passenger services for the rest of the day. A spokesman from the Steam Packet company said the fast-craft ferry, Manannan covered passenger and freight requirements all weekend and more than 250 freight units were cleared before the weekend.","Repaired Manx ferry, the Ben-my-Chree, is due to resume sailings to and from the Isle of Man after Dry Dock repairs."
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The declassified papers come from 1988. An official from the Department of Foreign Affairs reports observations from Paddy McGrory, the solicitor for the families of three IRA members killed by the SAS in Gibraltar. The note said Mr McGrory had ""heard some dark mutterings from an IRA source regarding [Gerry] Adams' leadership"". Mr McGrory ""did not place any credence on this as, in his experience, the IRA was traditionally full of differing cliques and it is not unusual for one or other of those cliques to mutter darkly about the various leaderships from time to time"". Mr Adams was president of Sinn Féin from 1983 until 2018. While not disassociating himself from the IRA, he has always denied membership. In 1988, Mr Adams and SDLP leader John Hume were engaged in the first of the Hume-Adams talks. According to the declassified note, Mr McGrory said he thought Mr Adams remained secure in the leadership and, while it might appear he had differences with Martin McGuinness, it was important to note they ""were close personal friends"". ""In his view, Adams is very committed to the republican movement and, to McGrory's mind, would be the last person to be involved in initiating any type of friction or break-up within the movement,"" said the note. It was hardly a surprise that the Northern Ireland Office Minister for State Nick Scott was, according to a London Irish embassy note sent back to Dublin, ""in despair"" about the unionist leadership in 1986. They opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement that gave Dublin a say in Northern Ireland's internal affairs. Paisley 'intellectual bankrupt'? 1988 saw the first Papal visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, but it did not go quite as planned. Moments after Pope John Paul II started speaking, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MEP Ian Paisley started heckling, telling the Polish pope he was the ""antichrist"". Mr Scott described ""Paisley's antics"" as reflecting the DUP leader's ""intellectual bankruptcy"". There are also insights into perceived divisions and personality issues in various parties. One note said that, in his opposition to the 1985 accord, DUP leader Ian Paisley would not want to ""find himself outflanked by his deputy leader Peter Robinson"". On the SDLP side, there is another note that hints at Seamus Mallon, the party deputy leader, feeling left out when John Hume met Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Garret Fitzgerald, without him or Peter Barry, the Foreign Affairs Minister. The note says that Mr Mallon ""expressed the hope that the big four format would be adhered to in future rather than the big two"".",References to divisions in the IRA and the republican movement is among the political gossip revealed in newly-released Irish state papers.
"Chief Minister Howard Quayle said that from 23:59 GMT on Thursday ""any regular"" projects ""must stop"". Companies would be allowed to ""make safe any work sites"" on Friday, Mr Quayle added. Three further people on the island have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the Isle of Man's total to 29. Two of the 29 are receiving hospital treatment. Grants of £3,000 will be be made available to firms in the construction industry, the government said. Projects put on hold include the £25m refurbishment of Douglas Promenade. At the Manx government's daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Mr Quayle said: ""We know that this is a significant sector in our economy but we have also been advised that this is another area of activity that can increase the risk of the virus spreading."" An emergency grant scheme to help the self-employed during the Covid-19 crisis will be extended to include those working in the building industry, Treasury Minister Alfred Cannan said. The grants were introduced as part of a £100m package of measures to support the Manx economy during the pandemic.","All but emergency construction work on the Isle of Man has been halted because of the coronavirus outbreak, the government has said."
"Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter@awzurcheron Twitter Here are five takeaways from the president's address, plus analysis of the Democratic response. New speech, same conflict The feel-good moment of the 2019 State of the Union address occured when the president recognised the record number of women serving in the US Congress, prompting the white-clad legislators to stand and cheer in an unscripted show of exuberance. It probably wasn't lost on the president, however, that most of those cheering were Democrats - and that they won their recent elections by running against his policies. They - along with most other Democrats - were decidedly not cheering for the rest of the president's speech. They were stone-faced as the president spoke about immigration. They sat on their hands as he urged Congress to pass new anti-abortion legislation. There were audible groans when Mr Trump warned that ""ridiculous partisan investigations"" of his administration might threaten the ""economic miracle"" in the US. While the president leavened his speech with applause lines and tributes to World War Two veterans, childhood cancer patients and Holocaust survivors, the sharp divisions within US politics were also on full display. The address even started with a not-so-subtle slight. The president began to speak without waiting for a formal introduction from House Speaker, and top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi - a break with tradition. Ms Pelosi's office tweeted responses and criticisms of the president's speech while it was occurring, and several times her applause seemed less like an approbation than a sharp rebuke. The two adversaries started the year locked in mortal partisan combat, and this State of the Union address gave no indication of an end to the conflict. No immigration exit ramp Perhaps the biggest issue looming over Mr Trump's State of the Union Address was the ongoing confrontation between Democrats and Republicans over immigration policy and Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It led to the recently concluded government shutdown and, if a compromise is not reached, could result in another shutdown a week from Friday. The president, who made the wall a central focus of his 2016 campaign, has backed away from his call for it to stretch along the entirety of the Mexican border. He's no longer saying it will be a concrete structure, instead describing it on Tuesday as a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"". And there was no mention of his pledge that Mexico would pay for the structure. The president insisted, however, that ""walls work and walls save lives"". Democrats have shown no indication that they will offer any sort of wall funding. Something has to give. On Tuesday night, Mr Trump didn't indicate a way out. There was no threat of a presidential ""emergency declaration"" that might allow Mr Trump to order the US military to build the wall without congressional approval. There were no signs of backing down. Instead, Mr Trump concluded his roughly 17 minutes of immigration talk with an open-ended bit of vagary, placing this political bag of snakes firmly in the laps of congressional negotiators. ""Let's work together, compromise and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,"" he said. A re-election pitch With Democratic candidates - many sitting in the Capitol - already lining up to challenge Mr Trump in next year's presidential election, this address could also be viewed as the president's first big speech of his re-election campaign. First, he listed his accomplishments. He spoke of an ""unprecedented economic boom"", boasting of rising wages, 5.3 million new jobs, 600,000 new manufacturing jobs and low unemployment. The credit for this, he said, was his tax cut and reductions in government regulation. And for the first time since 1955, he noted, the US is a net energy exporter, which he also took credit for (although the trends have been in place since the Obama-era fracking boom). Mr Trump also mentioned a couple of other legislative successes, including criminal justice reform and a law that allows patients with terminal disease to try experimental drugs. If the economy is still good, however, the economy will be the heart of his re-election pitch. A presidential campaign is about more than selling the candidate, however. It's also about convincing the public the alternative is the wrong choice. And in a few lines on Tuesday night, the president gave a preview of what's to come there, as well. After talking about the ""brutality"" of Nicolas Maduro's Venezuelan government, Mr Trump pivoted to an attack on his political opponents. ""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,"" he said. ""America was founded on liberty and independence, not government coercion, domination and control."" Recent polls have showing a growing number of Democrats adopting a more positive view of ""socialism"" compared to capitalism - although, in this case, they are supporting policies more in line with European socialism and not Venezuelan dictatorship. The president, however, is making no such distinctions and, instead, appears poised to paint Democratic presidential hopefuls who are flocking to the left on issues like healthcare, education and income inequality as too radical to be trusted with power. ""We renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,"" Mr Trump concluded to thunderous applause from the Republicans in the room. Expect to hear similar lines again and again, all the way to the November 2020 election day. The rest of the agenda The political battles over the wall for the past two months have effectively crowded out any discussion of other presidential priorities. In his State of the Union address, the president made an effort to breathe life into some of his other policy priorities, including areas that could - in less polarised times - find bipartisan support. Infrastructure investment, that long promised but never formally proposed presidential goal, again got a plug. He touted his newly negotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, although he never explicitly called on Congress to approve the deal, which it must do at some point. There were a couple of lines about lowering prescription drug prices and eliminating HIV transmission and childhood cancer. When he turned to foreign policy - the final topic in his speech - the laundry list continued. He touted withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and warned that if a new deal can't be reached, the US would ""outspend and out-innovate"" all others in nuclear weapons development. He boasted of ongoing negotiations with North Korea, including a new summit with Kim Jong-un later this month. He also spoke of concluding ""endless wars"", again asserting that the US will withdraw its military from Syrian and negotiate peace in Afghanistan. He gave no timeline for the process, however. On foreign policy, the president does have broad powers. If Mr Trump can ignore the criticisms from lawmakers and occasional disapproval within his administration, he could realise some of his objectives. When it comes to domestic policy, however, his proposals are effectively dead in the water. They were filler in the speech, delivered without enthusiasm. By tomorrow, most will be forgotten, as the whirlwind of modern American politics twists on. The Democratic response It's getting difficult for Democrats to find a voice for the party who also doesn't harbour, secretly or publicly, presidential ambitions. Rather than give a leg up to an aspiring White House candidate, the Democrats turned to someone whose most recent run at elective office ended in defeat, Stacey Abrams of Georgia. Although Ms Abrams isn't a current officeholder, her campaign for Georgia governor did reflect where the Democratic Party is today - ethnically diverse, and politically progressive. Where the president's address was light on new policy proposals, Ms Abrams Democratic response was packed with policy. In around five minutes, she touched on gun control, the cost of higher education, climate change, healthcare reform and voting rights. She blamed the Republicans for the government shutdown, criticised the president's tax reform bill as being ""rigged against working people"" and touted the contribution of immigrants to US society. The Democratic Party has more than its share of internal disagreements. There are questions over how to accomplish universal healthcare and low-cost college education, how to address income inequality and racism, and what taxes to cut and raise. They have their own debates about foreign policy, made clear when some Democratic presidential contenders in the House chamber applauded Mr Trump's line about endless foreign wars. Ms Abrams response, however, smoothed over those divides and presented the Democratic Party as the compassionate alternative to Mr Trump and the Republicans. ""Our progress has always been found in the refuge, in the basic instinct of the American experiment, to do right by our people,"" she said. As the Democratic presidential contest heats up, however, the differences within the party - and between the personalities battling to be the face of that party - will be impossible to ignore.","It's the halfway point of Donald Trump's first term in office, and - for more than an hour - the president had the nation's undivided attention. It was a speech that was billed as bipartisan, but beneath the flowery language were the same sharp divides and disagreements."
"The Turkish embassy in Washington said the allegations were ""utterly false, ludicrous and groundless"". Ex-CIA director James Woolsey revealed an alleged $15m (£11.5m) plan to remove cleric Fethullah Gulen in March. Turkey accuses Mr Gulen of being behind the failed July 2016 coup. In a statement, the embassy said: ""The Turkish people expect the immediate extradition of Fethullah Gulen from the United States to Turkey, so that he can stand trial."" They added: ""All allegations that Turkey would resort to means external to the rule of law for his extradition are utterly false, ludicrous and groundless."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly called for Mr Gulen's extradition from the US, where he lives in Pennsylvania. President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is accused of meeting Turkish officials in September 2016 to discuss the removal of Mr Gulen. My Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the claims were ""outrageous"". According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Flynn - who quit his post after misleading the White House about meeting a Russian envoy before Donald Trump took office - discussed having Mr Gulen transported on a private jet to the Turkish prison island of Imrali. It also reported that a payment was offered. The newspaper said the matter had emerged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Meanwhile, NBC said that federal investigators were also looking into whether Mr Flynn had tried to push for the return of Mr Gulen to Turkey during his time as White House national security adviser. But Mr Kelner vociferously denied all the allegations. He issued a statement saying that, as a rule, he and his client had avoided responding to media rumours and allegations. ""But today's news cycle has brought allegations about General Flynn, ranging from kidnapping to bribery, that are so outrageous and prejudicial that we are making an exception to our usual rule: they are false,"" he added. Ex-CIA chief Mr Woolsey, who is also a board member for Mr Flynn's consultancy, Flynn Intel Group, previously told CNN about a meeting involving Turkish officials in September 2016. ""There was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting that we would be able, the United States would be able, through them, to be able to get hold of Gulen,"" he said. A spokesman for the company denied Mr Flynn had discussed any illegal actions with the officials.","Reports that former White House aide Michael Flynn was part of a plot to help forcibly remove a Muslim cleric to Turkey in exchange for millions of dollars are ""ludicrous"", Turkey says."
"The death toll jumped on Tuesday from a previously confirmed figure of 844. The 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. Aid supplies are beginning to arrive in the city, where survivors have no access to running water or electricity. As tensions and need run high, police have begun guarding shops against looters. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Palu saw police firing warning shots and tear gas on Tuesday as people tried to take supplies from one shop. Officers initially took a lenient approach to survivors seizing basic goods, deputy national police chief Ari Dono Sukmanto said, but some people have since been arrested for stealing computers and cash. ""After day two the food supply started to come in, it only needed to be distributed,"" he said. ""We are now re-enforcing the law."" Humanitarian relief convoys entering the city are also being escorted by soldiers and police. In a separate incident, a volcano began erupting on the same island, Sulawesi, on Wednesday. Mount Soputan is about 1,000km (600 miles) away from Palu, and it was not immediately seen as a threat to the aid operation. 'No drinks since yesterday' Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu After days of waiting for aid, Wasliha decided she had to walk to find help. Her young family trekked through the mountains for more than 10 hours from her devastated village of Lolu Sigi Biromaru to Palu airport. ""We had no clean water or food and all we have is the clothes we are wearing,"" she says. Her children gulp down the water we give them, they haven't drunk anything since yesterday She had heard the military was flying out and had joined hundreds of people at the airport hoping to get a seat. Everyone wants to get out. Most can't and are having to endure another day without power and limited drinking water. In the town square people patiently wait in line to refill water bottles. Those that can make it here receive two meals a day, from a community kitchen run by volunteers and gallon of water to bathe in. Erna Wahyuni is cutting up a mountain of cabbage for soup. Her house was destroyed, but she wants to help. ""I was saved so I have to give back. It's also hard just sitting in a tent in the hot sun all day, I would rather be cooking,"" she laughs. Are there still hopes of finding survivors? Some people were rescued from the rubble in the first few days. But many of the buildings brought down by the quake were then swamped by the tsunami, so hopes of more rescues are fading. In the hills above Palu, volunteers are filling a vast grave with the bodies of the dead. They have been told to prepare for 1,300 victims to arrive. The ground has become highly unstable and is constantly moving, making the search a dangerous operation and raising the risk of mudslides. Among the people confirmed dead are 34 Indonesian students, whose bodies were found under a church buried by one mudslide. Dozens more are still missing there. Teams have so far recovered three survivors from the ruins of the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa in Palu. An estimated 50 people were also inside when the quake hit. Rescue team leader Agus Haryono said they were using acoustic detectors to try to locate more survivors. He said concrete and metal cutters were helping to clear the debris but added: ""We have to be very careful so we don't risk hurting any survivors."" President Joko Widodo has called for reinforcements, telling the national search-and-rescue agency to send more police officers and soldiers into affected districts. ""There are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who've not yet been found,"" he said. Why are people struggling to get help? Across Palu, a damaged bridge, blocked roads, a partially closed airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. But for thousands of people wanting to get the first commercial flight out of Palu, the wait continues. ""I'd get a plane anywhere. I've been waiting for two days. Haven't eaten, barely had a drink,"" 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid told Reuters. On Monday, 3,000 to 5,000 people who wanted to be evacuated from Palu swarmed the airport hoping to hitch a ride on a military Hercules plane. The military arranged for them to depart on ferries instead. What was Palu like? The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says there are nearly 200,000 people in urgent need of assistance, about a quarter of them children. The British government said on Tuesday it was sending a transport aircraft filled with urgent aid to Indonesia. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Britain stands united with Indonesia as they recover from this devastating tragedy."" Why was the disaster so bad? The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday. Scientists believe it may have triggered an underwater landslide which set off a tsunami. The waves built up height and speed as they travelled down the long narrow bay towards Palu. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands, while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected.","The number of people known to have died in Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 1,347, disaster response officials say."
"The suit alleges the police officers violated Mr Floyd's rights when they detained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force and racism to take root in its police force. Mr Floyd's death is part of a ""public health crisis"" in black America, said the family's attorney Ben Crump. New body camera videos have emerged showing Mr Floyd's final moments. In the footage, Mr Floyd is seen pleading with officers as they try to force him into their car, US media say. Mr Floyd reportedly tells police he could not breathe, and asks if he could lie on the ground instead. A district judge allowed news outlets to view the two videos, which show the clearest picture yet of Mr Floyd's last moments in the Minnesota city on 25 May. All of the officers involved have since been fired and charged over his death. Derek Chauvin, who in a separate video filmed by eyewitnesses was seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, has been charged with second-degree murder. The three other officers - Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. A Minneapolis judge has set a tentative trial date for the four on 8 March, 2021. The death of Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed African American, sparked huge protests across the US against police brutality and racism. Civil rights attorney Mr Crump announced the Floyd family's lawsuit against Minneapolis on Wednesday, filed in US District Court in Minnesota. Mr Crump said the legal action will seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of Mr Floyd's children and siblings. ""This complaint shows what we have said all along, that Mr Floyd died because the weight of the entire Minneapolis Police Department was on his neck,"" he said in a statement. What did the videos show? The body camera recordings from Mr Lane and Mr Kueng form part of the ongoing case against all four police officers. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill allowed news outlets to view the videos, which have so far not been made public. Previously, only transcripts were made public. The videos begin as Minneapolis police officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng are seen responding to a call over a fake banknote being used at a local market, according to CNN. It says that seconds after speaking with a store employee, the officers were at the door of the car Mr Floyd was in and, after an initial knock with a torch, Mr Lane points a gun at Mr Floyd and orders him to put his hands up. Mr Floyd is seen sobbing and pleading with the officers, and is then pulled from the vehicle as the officers struggle to handcuff him. A big struggle ensues when Mr Lane and Mr Kueng attempt to put him in the police car. Eventually, Mr Floyd falls out of the car, and it is at this point that the other two officers, Mr Thao and Mr Chauvin, appear in the videos, CNN reports. They all try to restrain the suspect, and Mr Chauvin is later seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck. During this time Mr Floyd is heard more than 20 times telling the officers that he cannot breathe. More on George Floyd's death",George Floyd's family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and four officers charged in his death.
"Carrie GracieChina editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter So far its customers have been confined to countries like Pakistan, Romania and Argentina with the developed world opting for American, Japanese and French technology. But the Energy Secretary, Amber Rudd, has said that China will be part of building the next generation of UK nuclear power stations and that having Chinese design up and running in the UK would give other countries confidence on safety. Safety is a key question. China launched a nationwide safety inspection into all its existing nuclear facilities in the wake of the Tianjin chemical warehouse disaster last month that killed more than 160 people. Though none of its existing reactors has experienced any serious accidents, its entire nuclear construction programme was suspended in 2011 following Japan's Fukushima disaster. New approvals started again this year. China is the world's biggest builder of nuclear power plants. It currently operates 24 reactors with a further 25 under construction. Critics say the industry is expanding too fast given its brief history in China and serious shortage of experienced engineers and operators. They also complain that safety regimes have come second to profit and that China offers no protection for whistleblowers. At home the Chinese government is committed to fast expansion to reduce air pollution and cut dependence on imported oil and gas. But as with other high-value infrastructure like high speed rail, Beijing is also keen to leverage this technology for commercial advantage abroad. Given the UK's long track record on nuclear power, and internationally recognised safety standards, a contract to build a Chinese-designed plant in Essex would be a huge endorsement for China, and one which will raise eyebrows in other European capitals and in Washington where the Obama administration would certainly not invite Chinese involvement in a strategic project with sensitive security implications. But the chancellor has said there is to be ""deepening collaboration in nuclear sectors in the UK and China"" and all eyes will be on London next month for the signing of these important deals during President Xi Jinping's state visit to Britain.","For China, the prize on offer in the UK is not the investment in Hinkley Point or Sizewell B but a controlling stake at Bradwell in Essex. This could be the first Chinese-designed nuclear power plant in the West, a massive breakthrough for China in promoting global exports of its nuclear technology."
"By Jessica LussenhopBBC News Kate could tell something was wrong. She'd been feeling nauseous for days and her body just felt different. The 27-year-old massage school student and her boyfriend were supposed to leave on a short road trip together, but before they hit the highway, she asked him to drive to a local drugstore. Kate, which is not her real name, bought a pregnancy test and took it in the store bathroom. It was positive. ""I probably lost all my colour,"" she recalls. ""I was pretty devastated."" Over the six-hour drive that followed, the young couple wrestled with the decision in front of them - to become parents or not. Kate was open to the idea, but as a full-time student doing odd jobs on the side to make ends meet, she was also broke. Her boyfriend told her he wasn't ready to become a father. ""I struggle putting food on the table and I'm in debt,"" she says. ""I just didn't see how I could justify putting a kid in that situation."" The nearest abortion clinic was hours away, and the attendant who answered the phone told her that because she was less than 10 weeks along, she could terminate the pregnancy with pills - one dose of the drug mifepristone to take at the clinic, and a second medication, misoprostol, to take at home. She was also told it would cost nearly $800. Kate was shocked. ""It would have taken everything I have. I don't know how I would have paid rent."" So she did what thousands of women around the globe do every year - she decided to try to have an abortion on her own. Despite the fact that abortion is legal in the US, various studies have estimated that hundreds of thousands of Americans have tried to end a pregnancy without the help of a doctor at some point in their lives, whether through medication, herbs, vitamin C, alcohol, drugs or self-harm. Although accurate figures are difficult to come by, one study estimated that in the state of Texas alone, between 100,000 and 240,000 people had attempted a self-induced abortion. A New York Times analysis of Google data found that in 2015, there were 700,000 searches from the US for information about self-managed abortion - phrases like ""how to have a miscarriage,"" ""how to self-abort"" and ""buy abortion pills online"". With the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court, pro-choice activists are preparing for the possible dismantling of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision which legalised abortion across the country. In this imagined ""post-Roe"" United States, some campaigners are making the case that women need to know the facts about how to ""self-manage"" their own abortions. ""This is the next frontier in abortion access,"" says Erin Matson, co-founder of Reproaction, a pro-choice group that has begun hosting public information sessions on self-managed abortion throughout the US. ""Everybody has a right to know information about how to safely and effectively end a pregnancy on their own. It's bigger than this political moment."" Anti-abortion activists say that even if Roe is overturned, it is unlikely abortion would become illegal across the US, and that it's a dangerous argument for women managing their own care. ""All overturning Roe v Wade would do is give the question back to the states and allow the states to legislate the procedure,"" says Dr Ingrid Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist in San Antonio, Texas, and a board member of the American Association of Pro-Life OB-GYNs. ""I think that even if restrictions were put in place so that more women could not access the procedure, that many more women would carry their pregnancies to term and probably many of these women would find that what began as an unintended pregnancy would become a desired pregnancy and a desired child."" Though the phrase ""self-managed abortion"" conjures images of coat hangers and disreputable, back-alley abortionists, campaigners say that is not the world we live in anymore, in large part thanks to the development of abortion with pills, which can be used with about 95% effectiveness until 10 weeks into a pregnancy. ""A third of all abortions now, you go to the clinic and get pills and go home and do the abortion,"" says Dr Beverly Winikoff, founder and president of Gynuity Health Project. ""Doing an abortion now means swallowing a pill."" More on the US abortion story Such was the case for Kate, who quickly found online pharmacies who could ship her mifepristone and misoprostol from India for half the cost. However, she didn't like the look of the websites or trust that the medication would be genuine. That's when she came across a new site called Aid Access, which quietly came online earlier this spring. The reproductive rights advocates behind websites like Women Help Women, Safe2Choose and Women on Web have been sending abortion pills by mail to countries where abortion is illegal or severely restricted for over a decade. One study found that of 1,000 Irish women who received pills by mail using the Women on Web service, 95% ended their pregnancies successfully. But until very recently, none of these services would ship to the US - a wealthy, first-world country where abortion is legal, and the anti-abortion movement is politically powerful and litigious. That changed this spring, when Dr Rebecca Gomperts, the Dutch physician behind Women on Web, founded Aid Access. She publicly announced its existence earlier this month, though she estimates she's already sent 600 mifepristone-misoprostol kits to the US since April. Dr Gomperts says that after reading email pleas for help from all over the US and watching how many restrictions states have placed on abortion services over the last 10 years, she decided something had to be done. ""It is especially the really poor women who are affected by obstacles that have been put in place in the last years,"" she says. ""The need is growing and it's super desperate."" When Kate got to Aid Access, she filled out a short survey that asked about the length of her pregnancy, her medical history and her reasons for needing help. She was approved, paid a $95 fee (women too poor to pay can still receive the medication) and gave Aid Access her address. Dr Gomperts wrote Kate the prescription from her private practice in Europe. After the little brown box arrived in the mail (from a pharmacy in India that Dr Gomperts declines to name), Kate took the medication as instructed, and says that after a sleepless night of painful cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, she began to bleed. By morning, it was over. ""I felt a real sense of relief two days later,"" she says. ""I'd been so miserable for what seemed like forever."" Aid Access is just the newest way American women can get their hands directly on medication without going through a doctor. Online pharmacies - many located in India - will sell the drugs without a prescription (one research group bought 22 such products online and received 20, and although some of the blister packs were damaged, 72% contained enough of the drug to be effective). Misoprostol - which is less effective than mifepristone but can be used on its own to induce a miscarriage - is sold over the counter in Mexico and has been found for sale at US flea markets near the border. Some activists believe that with accurate information about how to take the medication and when to seek help, abortions can easily be done at home. ""We can trust women to make decisions and to manage their own abortions,"" says Dr Gomperts. ""Women have a human right to health."" Obtaining abortion drugs in the US without a prescription is against the law. The US Food and Drug Administration has placed mifepristone under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which is a special restriction on distribution for medications that may have serious risks associated with their use. The opioid fentanyl is also under a REMS, for example. Mifepristone can only be distributed in a doctor's office or hospital. In a statement to the BBC, the FDA said it is looking into Aid Access: ""The agency takes the allegations related to the sale of mifepristone in the US through online distribution channels very seriously and is evaluating the allegations to assess potential violations of US law."" However, many doctors believe that the REMS on mifepristone is unnecessary, and both the American Medical Association, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that the restriction be lifted. ""To date, 19 deaths have been reported to the FDA among the more than three million women in the United States who have used [mifepristone],"" one working group of doctors wrote in 2017 in the New England Journal of Medicine. ""Pregnancy-related death... is 14 times higher."" Anti-abortion organisations, like the Family Research Council, argue that the medication is not safe enough to be provided over the counter, and that circumventing FDA regulations is even riskier. Women who have an ectopic pregnancy, who have an intrauterine device or who have a history of adrenal health problems are not advised to take mifepristone. Rare complications include sepsis or haemorrhage, which could be life threatening. ""Just sort of violating the law and the distribution requirements - there are reasons these things are in place,"" says Chris Gacek, a senior fellow on regulatory affairs at the Family Research Council. ""Regardless of your views on abortion, I just don't think this is good medicine."" There are other, legal attempts to remove obstacles between patients and medication. Planned Parenthood currently runs telemedicine programmes in 14 states, where a doctor consults with the patient online or via telephone at a clinic that is convenient for her, and if the doctor determines she is eligible for medication abortion, he or she unlocks a drawer containing the pills remotely. Researchers at Gynuity Health Projects are currently running a study that's been filed with the FDA, in which women are directly mailed the drugs after consultation with a physician. However, 19 other states have a ban on abortion drugs being dispensed by telemedicine, and since the medications are not obtainable without a prescription in the US, any pregnant person trying to obtain the pills without a doctor's help is operating in risky legal territory. ""I would never encourage anyone to do that,"" says Tara Kepler, an attorney of counsel at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner and a telemedicine legal expert. ""There's no way to get it without a prescription unless you're violating the law."" At the same time, Kepler says that she's never heard of legal action being taken against a patient for ordering a prescription online. Activists say that since women will continue trying to self-induce abortion regardless of the legal risks, it is their responsibility to put out helpful, accurate information. ""What we know is people were managing their abortions before Roe, and have and will continue to do so without Roe,"" says Pamela Merritt, co-founder of Reproaction. On a balmy Sunday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, a small group gathered in the brightly lit basement of an old union hall in St Louis, Missouri. A handwritten sign hung on the door read, ""Self-Managed Abortion Forum"". Attendance was modest - 10 men and women in total - and the bags of crisps and fruit salad sat untouched. Organisers wondered if the event might inspire protest, but none materialised. Nevertheless, the sense of urgency in the room was palpable. Several people declined to provide their names, and said that they intentionally did not RSVP to the event on Facebook. ""It could be traced back if [abortion] gets criminalised,"" said one. ""I'm a pharmacist,"" another said. ""That could be bad for me."" ""I'm clergy,"" added a third. Next to the fruit salad was a stack of fact-sheets which laid out how a regimen of 12 tablets of misoprostol taken four at a time over the course of nine hours can induce an abortion. ""Misoprostol is typically used within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and is about 85 percent effective,"" the card read, next to a cartoon of a woman with four pills under her tongue. Pamela Merritt, one of three panellists at the front of the room, said that to her knowledge, hers is the only group actively promoting information on self-managed abortion. Her co-director Erin Matson acknowledged merely hosting the discussion is ""radical"". Still, they believe the need for these conversations is clear. ""The Supreme Court has solidified a 5-4 conservative majority for the foreseeable future,"" said Merritt. ""We now must proceed in a way that protects access to care and protects people who are most vulnerable to reproductive oppression."" Still, the activists have to be careful. Reproaction's panellists never explain how to obtain the pills. Instead, they refer the audience to links online with more information. ""It's actually not that complex, how to use these pills to end a pregnancy. What's complex is how to talk about it in a way that doesn't expose people to legal liability,"" says Matson. ""We are not providing advice. We are not coaching people who are self-managing their abortions through the process. We are sharing the World Health Organization's protocol."" According to the WHO, ""where mifepristone is unavailable"" misoprostol - the second drug prescribed for a medication abortion - is the ""recommended method of medical abortion"". The drug was developed for the treatment of stomach ulcers, but researchers soon discovered it also causes miscarriage. Misoprostol is cheaper and less highly regulated than mifepristone, and there are no tests that would detect it in the blood stream. It is less effective than taking misoprostol together with mifepristone, but in absence of other options, World Health Organization reports say that the regimen is safe and effective at ending pregnancy. In St Louis, one of the panellists was Dr Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist who - until just the week prior - provided abortion services at clinics in Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri. Newly enforced state regulations revoked her admitting privileges, meaning she can only do abortions at a single clinic located in St Louis. Missouri now joins the ranks of one-clinic states like North Dakota, West Virginia and Kentucky. ""If we get to a place where there are states or large portions of the country where there is no access to abortion, I think self-managed abortion will fill at least part of that gap whether we like it or not,"" says Dr McNicholas. ""I have both a clinical and moral obligation to help women do the safest thing that they can to achieve the outcome they want. Whether I'm able to actually provide the care is irrelevant."" The number of clinics in the Midwest has dropped 22% over the last five years, and the state of Texas alone has shuttered 32 clinics. Thirty-three states have passed laws to limit or restrict patient access to abortion over the past decade. For instance, in Missouri, women must wait 72 hours after their initial doctor visit to get the abortion, a significant obstacle for those who are driving long distances, and may have jobs and need childcare. Merritt says that in places like Missouri, women are already living in the equivalent of a post-Roe world. ""For a lot of people abortion access is a right in name only - particularly for people experiencing financial difficulties,"" she says. At the St Louis discussion, audience members asked questions about legal exposure, and what someone ought to do if she took misoprostol but then needed to go to a hospital with complications. ""They should say they're pregnant and bleeding,"" said Dr McNicholas. ""That's all the information that needs to be given."" Self-inducing an abortion with pills carries legal risk. Although no one has ever been prosecuted directly for purchasing abortion drugs online, the act of buying pills has been used as evidence for criminal charges, including murder. The most famous case was Purvi Patel, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison under Indiana's feticide law before her conviction was overturned. Similar cases have played out in Idaho, Virginia and Georgia. In some of these cases, it was a doctor or hospital employee where the woman sought help who contacted police. Dr Skop, the anti-abortion obstetrician-gynecologist in San Antonio, says that if a woman does not tell her doctor that she has tried to self-induce an abortion with misoprostol, she puts her doctor at a disadvantage in her treatment. She adds that she would never turn a woman over to authorities if she found out she'd tried to end her own pregnancy. ""I would care for her. I think that most OBGYNs would,"" she says. At the end of the session in St Louis, some swapped stories about how they were preparing for the end of Roe. Two said they'd been stockpiling doses of Plan B, the so-called ""morning after pill"", just in case that medication were also discontinued or even criminalised. ""We have to protect each other,"" said one woman. ""The system is not going to save us."" The day after Kate took her pills, her morning sickness was gone and she was able to eat normally for the first time in weeks. The day after that, she was back at work. She says she is no longer pregnant, and confident that she made the right decision. ""I'm grateful that I was able to access the medication because I think it's better than the alternative,"" she says. ""I didn't understand why it was that expensive, not to mention the drive both ways, and missing work for me. I wouldn't have done it another way."" At the same time, she stresses that her experience was difficult. Her first shipment of medication got stuck in somewhere in customs and she had to send frantic emails requesting another shipment, which she got free of charge. The delay was extremely stressful and although she knows this is not everyone's experience with the medication, she found the process very physically painful. ""I don't want it to seem like it was easy, because really, it's not,"" she says. ""It was pretty traumatic, the whole thing."" Otto, another person who used Aid Access, says the package arrived without incident and that though there were intense, painful cramps and vomiting, the experience was a positive one. As someone who identifies as gender-fluid and finds doctor visits of any kind uncomfortable, Otto was relieved to do the procedure at home with supportive roommates, instead of hours away, alone in a hotel room. ""I was, kind of, I don't know - really proud of myself for how far I'd come in my understanding of my own body and the politics of my own body,"" Otto says. ""I was just excited."" Kate also says she has no regrets, and the fact that she might be breaking the law didn't scare her or impact her decision to seek out the medication on her own. She's nearly finished with school, and is eager to start a career in massage working specifically with cancer patients. She hopes that by speaking out about her experience, other women in similar situations will do whatever they feel is best for them. ""If you end up having to take things in your own hands, it is your body, it's your life,"" she says. ""I think everybody should have that right."" To protect their anonymity, the BBC has changed some names and omitted identifying information. .","Accessing abortion has become increasingly difficult in parts of the US. As a result, a growing number of reproductive rights activists say it is time American women learn the facts about ""self-managing abortion"" with pills."
"The wall of the reservoir could collapse within a day or a week, Environment State Secretary Zoltan Illes said. A new wall is being built to protect villages already devastated by the flood of industrial waste on 4 October. At least seven people have died as a result of the accident. Hungarian media quoted Mr Illes as saying that a 25-metre-long crack in the weakened wall of the reservoir near Ajka had widened slightly by Sunday morning and that the wall of the damaged reservoir now looked beyond repair. He said it was especially important to finish the new protective wall before new rainfall, expected in the next few days. ""Once the rain is here, the remaining sludge will be washed out and the the dam's northern sections is going to break away,"" Mr Illes said. The new wall is to be 600m (656yd) long and 5m to 7m high, officials said. Evacuation plans Repair work has also continued on the reservoir itself amid fears that what is already Hungary's worst environmental disaster could even get worse. Around 150 people were injured, with many receiving burns, by the spill of up to 700,000 cubic metres (24.7m cu ft) of red toxic sludge. The highly alkaline substance is a by-product of aluminium production and has a caustic effect on the skin. It contains heavy metals, such as lead, and inhaling its dust can cause lung cancer. Most of those killed were drowned or swept away in Kolontar as the sludge hit on Monday. The village is the closest to the reservoir, and would be expected to bear the brunt if there were a second spill. On Saturday about 800 residents of the village were evacuated to the town of Ajka, 8km (five miles) away. Police also told residents of the neighbouring town of Devecser to pack a single suitcase so they could leave quickly if necessary. Another 500,000 cubic metres of waste could escape if the reservoir wall was breached again, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Saturday. In the last few days residents and emergency workers have worked around the clock to remove the worst of the sludge, which has damaged houses, streets and farmland and polluted waterways. All life in the Marcal river, which feeds the Danube, is said to have been extinguished. The sludge reached the Danube on Thursday, but Hungarian officials said on Friday that the pH level in the river was ""normal"", easing fears that Europe's second longest river would be significantly polluted. Emergency crews have been working to dilute the alkaline content of the spill, adding huge quantities of gypsum and chemical fertilisers to the waters of the Marcal and Raba rivers. The company responsible for the alumina plant, MAL Hungarian Aluminium Production and Trade Company, has offered its condolences to the families of the bereaved but insists it did nothing wrong. It said it was devoting ""all its energies and efforts"" to tackling the spill, and had released 110,000 euros (£96,000) so far to help with the clean-up.",Hungarian work crews are racing against time to build an emergency dam as cracks widened at a burst reservoir that spilled toxic sludge.
"Mr Gingrich claimed Ms Kelly showed ""bias"" for mentioning the groping allegations against Mr Trump. Mr Trump praised Mr Gingrich's comments while breaking from the campaign to open his new hotel in Washington, DC. ""Congratulations,"" he said. ""That was an amazing interview last night...We don't play games, Newt"". Mr Gingrich appeared on Fox News on Tuesday on behalf of Mr Trump in what resulted in a heated exchange between him and Ms Kelly. The spat concluded when Ms Kelly ended the interview and told Mr Gingrich to ""take your anger issues and spend some time working on them"". On Wednesday, Mr Trump took time out from the presidential campaign to open a new hotel in Washington DC. The $212m (£173m) hotel opening at the city's Old Post Office Pavilion is Mr Trump's second marketing event of the week. He appeared at his Doral golf course near Miami, Florida, on Tuesday with a group of his Hispanic employees, many of whom offered testimonials about their experience working for him. But Kellyanne Conway, Mr Trump's campaign manager, told NBC's Today programme on Wednesday that his appearance at the opening was to showcase his accomplishments. ""Hillary Clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everyone looked at that as some kind of noble exercise,"" she said on NBC's Today show. ""He's got the most active campaign 'sched' of the two candidates by far."" At the scene - Courtney Subramanian, Trump International Hotel The Republican nominee appeared at the grand opening of his $200m luxury namesake hotel at the Old Post Office in Washington, just down the street from another piece of real estate he hopes to acquire in January - the White House. Small groups of protesters flanked the entrance of the hotel, only to be outnumbered by members of the press awaiting Mr Trump's second business promotion this week. The hotel may be ""under budget"", as Mr Trump claims, but it did not skimp on opulence. Staff welcomed guests through gold-flecked doorways into his Presidential Ballroom illuminated by grandiose crystal chandeliers. ""Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish in this country,"" Mr Trump said in his hotel's resplendent ballroom. The New York businessman transitioned from talking about restoring the Old Post Office to repairing the country's infrastructure, military equipment, education system and tax code. He struck a much softer tone than his usual harsh campaign rhetoric, talking of America's future. ""We have to choose the most optimistic path,"" he said. ""There is no dream outside our reach."" The hotel opening was seized on by Hillary Clinton as further evidence that Mr Trump exploits American workers. She told a rally in Lake Worth, Florida, that the businessman relied on undocumented workers ""to make his project cheaper"". Many of the products in the hotel's rooms were made overseas, she said. Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly has previously angered Mr Trump for questioning his attitude towards women. But it was the mention of the leaked ""sex boasts"" tapes - in which the presidential nominee is heard to say he grabbed women by the genitals - which angered Mr Gingrich on the Kelly File on Tuesday. The former Speaker of the House claimed the media was spending a disproportionate amount of time on the accusations of sexual misconduct, which Mr Trump has denied. ""You are fascinated with sex and you don't care about public policy,"" he told the bemused anchor. Ms Kelly replied that she was fascinated by ""the protection of women and understanding what we're getting in the Oval Office"". The interview ended with Ms Kelly telling Mr Gingrich to work on his ""anger issues"". There are less than two weeks to go before Americans cast their votes, with polls suggesting Democrat Hillary Clinton is ahead. Who is Megyn Kelly? Megyn Kelly is a lawyer-turned-journalist described by Time magazine as ""an authoritative voice in cable news"". The mother-of-three, from New York, began her career as a local news reporter in 2003, after nine years in law. But she was quickly scooped up by Fox News' Washington bureau, and now presents The Kelly File, one of most popular cable news programmes in the US. Ms Kelly previously raised eyebrows with a ""tongue-in-cheek"" remark over the colour of Santa Claus' skin in 2013. But it was her spat with Donald Trump which pushed her into the international spotlight. Predict the president Who will win?

"It follows Flybe pulling out of the route in March leaving just States-owned airline Aurigny to operate it. The price excludes UK Air Passenger Duty, which currently stands at £13. The move is part of tighter scrutiny being given to four States-owned companies in a bid to ensure they offer value for money for the island. The airline had accumulated losses of £12.5m by the end of 2012 and was expected to make further losses last year. Treasury and Resources Minister Gavin St Pier said: ""Aurigny remains confident that it can deliver on these commitments whilst continuing to move towards a break-even position for the airline in 2015/16."" The States is currently guaranteeing loans for the company, including one for the purchase of a 122-seat Embraer 195 jet for use on the Gatwick route, and has been asked to guarantee or loan money to allow the company to replace its trislander fleet. The fare targets are due to be reviewed annually so any change in costs, such as landing fees at Gatwick Airport, can be taken into account.","Sixty-percent of seats on flights between Guernsey and Gatwick will be sold for £65 or less during 2014, the island's treasury has announced."
"Evgeniy Bogachev was charged last year in the US with being behind a major cybercrime operation that allegedly stole more than $100m (£64.7m). He was last seen in Russia, where he is believed to remain at large. Arresting him may be difficult, as the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia. Mr Bogachev, also known as ""lucky12345"" and ""slavik"", is accused of running the GameOver Zeus attack network, thought to have infected more than one million computers. Victims were tricked into downloading malware - malicious software - which then searched specifically for financial information. '60 cyber-threats' Evgeniy Bogachev was charged last year on counts including conspiracy, wire, bank and computer fraud, and money laundering, after the FBI said it broke up the network. He is one of the FBI's most wanted cyber-criminals. ""This reward offer reaffirms the commitment of the US government to bring those who participate in organized crime to justice, whether they hide online or overseas,"" the US State Department said. The reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Mr Bogachev. The head of the FBI's cyber crime division, Joseph Demarest, said Russia's internal security agency had expressed an interest in working with the US on cybercrimes, according to Reuters, but did not link it to the Bogachev case. He also said the agency was aware of 60 different cyber-threat groups linked to nation-states, but gave no further details.","The US has offered a $3m (£1.94m) reward for information on a Russian hacker, the highest the US authorities have ever offered in a cybercrime case."
"Security forces earlier deployed armoured vehicles, transporting armed police, into Vila Cruzeiro, in the north of the city. The offensive comes after five days of clashes which have killed at least 30 people. Eight people of those were killed in Thursday's push, authorities said. In response to the police operation gangs have been setting up barricades, burning vehicles and opening fire, officials said. Officials said that drug traffickers had regrouped in Vila Cruzeiro after being expelled from other shanty towns in the city. Jose Beltrame, the state's Public Safety Director, said state police would receive additional support from federal law enforcement, in order to hold on to Vila Cruzeiro. He told reporters that police were in Vila Cruzeiro, ""and we're not leaving"". Some 17,500 police officers have been deployed to try to stop the violence. According to the government most of the victims of the violence are drug dealers, reports the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro. But innocent people have also been killed, including a 14-year-old girl and a 62-year-old lady, our correspondent adds. Vehicles on fire Some 150 members of the Special Police Operations Battalion (Bope) and the military police force, backed up by the navy's armoured vehicles, began arriving in Vila Cruzeiro at lunchtime on Thursday, Brazilian media reported. ""The aim of the operation is to arrest the people behind the attacks in the city,"" the head of Rio's military police, Col Alvaro Garcia, said. ""We're acting to reassure the population."" More than 150 suspects have been arrested in the raids at nearly 30 shanty towns in the northern and western parts of Rio since the weekend, when the latest wave of violence erupted. Heavily armed men have been stopping cars and buses, robbing passengers and setting vehicles alight. Residents of the hillside community said they did not know when life would return to normal. ""What am I going to do? I can't go to work, I can't go home,"" Maria das Gracas Fonseca, who works as a cleaner, told the Associated Press news agency. Her seven-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter had no school and no one to take care of them, she said. ""I need the work, but my children are more important. I don't even know where we'll sleep tonight, but I will be with them,"" she told AP. Rio's favelas have for years been controlled by heavily armed drug-trafficking gangs. The city's pacification programme is aimed at improving security and the rule of law in the run-up to Brazil's hosting of the football World Cup in 2014 and Rio's staging of the Olympic Games two years later.","Police in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, say they now have total control of the Vila Cruzeiro shanty town, as they continue a crackdown on violent drug gangs."
"Mr Trump, who is running for president, said he saw ""thousands and thousands"" of people in New Jersey celebrating. But the mayor of Jersey City said no such thing happened and accused the Republican of ""shameful politicising"". Mr Trump, who leads his party's race for the White House, has also urged increased surveillance of Muslims. His comments come after the attacks in Paris which left 130 people dead, and evidence suggesting that some of the attackers used refugee routes to enter the country. Since the attacks, the issue of national security and threat of homegrown terrorism has come to dominate the national political conversation. ""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" he said at a rally in Alabama. ""And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down."" Asked to explain on a Sunday morning political talk show, the business mogul said: ""There were people were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations."" The mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, released a statement later which said: ""Trump is plain wrong, and he is shamefully politicising an emotionally charged issue. ""We were actually among the first to provide responders to help in lower Manhattan."" One of Mr Trump's rivals in the presidential race, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, said he did not remember hearing of any celebrations. ""I do not remember that, and so it's not something that was part of my recollection,"" Mr Christie told local media. ""I think if it had happened, I would remember it, but, you know, there could be things I forget, too."" For years, rumours have circulated on the internet alleging that US Muslims in the city of Paterson in New Jersey cheered the attacks. However, the claims were denied by police and religious leaders at the time. Politifact, a non-partisan political fact-checking website, rated Mr Trump's remarks as ""pants on fire"". At the same rally on Saturday, Mr Trump was interrupted by a demonstrator from the Black Lives Matter movement. In response, the businessman said: ""Get him out of here. Throw him out!"" The demonstrator was seen on a video captured by a CNN reporter being shoved on the ground, punched and kicked. ""Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,"" Mr Trump said on Fox News on Sunday.","A US mayor has said businessman Donald Trump ""is plain wrong"" in claiming Arabs in his city cheered the attacks of 9/11."
"House of Representatives Democrats will send the charge of ""inciting insurrection"" to the Senate on Monday. But arguments will not begin until the week of 8 February, allowing Mr Trump's lawyers two weeks to build a defence. Democrats accuse the ex-president of instigating the deadly 6 January riot at the US Capitol. The House last week paved the way for the Senate proceedings by charging Mr Trump with inciting the violence, which left five people dead. His second impeachment trial will begin almost exactly a year after the Senate acquitted him on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. That case related to accusations he pressured Ukraine to help smear Joe Biden and his son. Mr Trump's term ended on Wednesday and he left Washington, snubbing his successor Joe Biden's inauguration. His speech to a rally ahead of the Capitol riot are at the heart of the case against him. The then-president told protesters near the White House to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard as they prepared to march towards the US Capitol building, which houses the US Congress. He also told them to ""fight like hell"". What did the Senate leaders agree? Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said on Friday that the House would deliver the impeachment article - or charge - on Monday. ""The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial,"" Mr Schumer said, speaking on the floor of the Senate. House Democrats say the article will be passed to the upper chamber of Congress at 19:00 local time on Monday. Democratic impeachment managers, lawmakers from the House who will act as prosecutors during the Senate trial, will be sworn in on Tuesday. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office said he was glad Mr Schumer had agreed to his request for more time during the pre-trial phase, and that the trial itself would begin on 9 February. A statement said: ""Especially given the fast and minimal process in the House, Republicans set out to ensure the Senate's next steps will respect former President Trump's rights and due process, the institution of the Senate, and the office of the presidency. ""That goal has been achieved. This is a win for due process and fairness."" Impeachment: The basics What is the White House's position? Earlier on Friday, President Biden also appeared to suggest he would prefer a later trial. He told reporters, referring to the urgent domestic issues that he wants to pass legislation to address: ""The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better."" The White House will however not say whether Mr Biden thinks Mr Trump should be convicted. ""[Joe Biden] is no longer in the Senate and it's up to the Senate and the Congress to hold the former president accountable,"" said press secretary Jen Psaki when asked on Friday. Will Trump be convicted? Even though Democrats now hold a narrow Senate majority, they would need the support of at least 17 Republicans in order to convict Mr Trump, because a two-thirds vote is required. But Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, told CNN on Friday: ""The chances of getting a conviction are virtually nil."" Only five Republican senators - Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - are seen as potential defectors. Mr Trump will be the first former US president ever to be tried by the Senate. No president has ever been convicted in such proceedings, and if Mr Trump were found guilty he could end up being barred from future office. On Friday, Mr Trump was approached by a reporter from the Washington Examiner at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The former president was asked about his future plans. ""We'll do something, but not just yet,"" he told the journalist from his regular table at the private club before an aide cut short the brief encounter. Mr Trump is residing five miles away at his other golf club, Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his ""Winter White House"".",The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump will begin next month under an agreement reached between Senate Democrats and Republicans.
"Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions. The Bhutanese name for Bhutan, Druk Yul, means ""Land of the Thunder Dragon"" and it only began to open up to outsiders in the 1970s. The Wangchuck hereditary monarchy has wielded power since 1907. But Bhutan became a two-party parliamentary democracy after elections in March 2008. FACTS LEADERS Head of state: King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck succeeded his father, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in December 2006 after the former monarch announced his abdication. His predecessor had already given up some of his absolute powers in 1998 and ruled in conjunction with the government, an assembly and a royal advisory council. Prime Minister: Tshering Tobgay Tshering Tobgay was elected Bhutan's second prime minister in July 2013, succeeding Jigme Yozer Thinley. He is president of the People's Democratic Party. He was leader of the opposition in the National Assembly from March 2008 to April 2013. He has projected himself as a reformer, rejecting official limousine and prime ministerial accommodation. MEDIA Television did not come to Bhutan until 1999. For years, the country cut itself off, fearing that outside influences would undermine its monarchy and culture. Radio broadcasting began in 1973 and the internet arrived in 1999. TIMELINE Some key dates in the history of Bhutan: 1720 - Chinese imperial army invades and temporarily establishes control over Bhutan. 1772-73 - British intervention. 1864-65 - Further intervention by Britain. 1907 - Ugyen Wangchuck is chosen as hereditary ruler. 1910 - Treaty giving Britain control over foreign relations. 1949 - Treaty signed with newly-independent India guaranteeing non-interference in Bhutan's internal affairs, but allowing Delhi influence over foreign relations. 1958 - Slavery abolished. 1974 - First foreign tourists allowed in. 1990 - Thousands of Hindus flee to Nepal following clashes. 1998 - King cedes some powers to national assembly.","Bhutan is a tiny and remote kingdom nestling in the Himalayas between its powerful neighbours, India and China."
"The National Constituent Assembly passed the text by 200 votes from 216. Analysts say politicians hope it will send out a message of stability after months of deadlock between Islamist and secular forces. Meanwhile, Prime Minister-designate Mehdi Jomaa says he has formed a new caretaker government. The cabinet consists mainly of independents and technocrats, and is expected to run the country until new elections. No date has been set for the polls. 'Historic milestone' After the vote on Sunday, the Tunisian flag was unfurled and parliamentarians embraced each other inside the chamber. ""This constitution, without being perfect, is one of consensus,"" AP quoted assembly speaker Mustapha Ben Jaafar as saying. Parliament agreed the text on Friday after the governing Ennahda party granted a number of concessions, including dropping references to Islamic law. It guarantees freedom of worship but says Islam is the state religion. It also forbids ""attacks on the sacred"", which analysts say is open to interpretation. The text also recognises equality between men and women for the first time. UN chief Ban Ki-moon hailed the agreement as a ""historic milestone"". ""Tunisia's example can be a model to other peoples seeking reforms,"" his spokesman said, reports the AFP news agency. Tunis-based journalist Naveena Kottoor says large parts of the Tunisian public remain unconvinced that this constitution will actually make a difference to their lives, with many more concerned about the country's economic problems. Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party, won the first democratic elections after long-time ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was forced from power in 2011. But it has faced fierce opposition from secular groups, who have accused it being too close to militant groups - charges it strongly denies. It has also been unable to end an economic crisis, another factor in widespread street protests. The constitution required two-thirds of assembly members to vote in favour. A signing ceremony is expected to follow. The killing of two secular politicians last year sparked a political crisis in Tunisia. Earlier this month, Ennahda Prime Minister Ali Larayedh stepped down and was replaced by Mehdi Jomaa, who will head a non-partisan, caretaker government, which is expected to be named in the coming days.",Tunisia's parliament has adopted a new constitution - the first since the ousting of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali three years ago.
"By Ahmed RouabaBBC News But opponents say it falls short of fundamental reform. The referendum's timing is auspicious. It falls on 1 November - the anniversary of the start of Algeria's war of independence against France back in 1954, a date today's government chose for its symbolism. It also comes though as Algeria's president has been flown to Germany for medical care. The cause of his ill health has not been disclosed, but President Abdelmadjid Tebboune had self-isolated and spent time in a military hospital in Algiers after a number of his aides and colleagues contracted coronavirus. Algerians are voting on presidential term limits and creating a new anti-corruption body. To win the referendum, either the ""yes"" or ""no"" camp needs at least 51% of the vote. Results are to be announced on Monday. Why now? President Tebboune, 74, came to power last year in a controversial election that followed the departure of Mr Bouteflika, who resigned in the face of massive popular protests against his bid for a fifth term in office. Mr Tebboune's election campaign saw him vow to ""lay the foundations of a new Algeria"". He pledged an end to what he calls the practices of the ""gang"" of politicians and businessmen in President Bouteflika's inner circle. Ultimately this new government is answerable to the demands of the huge popular movement, or Hirak, to reform the political system. And doing this has required redrafting Algeria's constitution. What are the key changes? Algeria will go back to allowing its presidents a maximum of two terms in office, if the constitutional amendments are approved in Sunday's referendum. The law had been changed under President Bouteflika in 2008 so he could run for a third term in power. MPs would also serve for a maximum of two terms. The proposed creation of a corruption-busting unit is a direct response to the major concern that caused popular anger and sparked the massive protests which led Mr Bouteflika to resign. And the new constitution would oblige public institutions to guarantee the freedom of press. What does the government say? Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad said the new constitution ""will put our country on the right path after years of deviousness mainly during the recent years under the gang"", referring to Mr Bouteflika's ruling clique. He insisted during the referendum campaign that the constitutional amendments were designed to meet the demands of the Hirak popular movement that ""toppled the corrupt regime"", and to reinforce the ""separation of powers"". How about its critics? The referendum is an attempt to ""suppress"" the protest movement and ""turn the page"" with a constitutional ""quick fix"" that Hirak has never claimed, says former judge-turned-opposition leader Zoubida Assoul. Political scientist Prof Louisa Dris-Ait Hammadouche says that the authorities missed an opportunity to involve current Hirak members in drafting the amendments and thereby confer legitimacy on the new constitution. Only former protest members were brought on board - the so-called ""original Hirak"" who withdrew once elections took place last year, seemingly appeased by a new government. What happened during campaigning? Campaigning played out mostly on TV, radio and social media because of coronavirus restrictions. But there was some dismay and criticism when Youth and Sports Minister Sid Ali Khaldi said people who ""reject the new constitution [should] leave the country"". Comments by another pro-change politician were called ""laughable"". Religious Affairs Minister Youcef Belmehdi described voting in favour of new constitution as an act of commitment to follow the teachings of the prophet of Islam. Who are the 'yes' and 'no' camps? The two largest parties in parliament - the National Liberation Front (FLN) and the National Democratic Rally (RND) - have both campaigned and called for a ""yes"" vote in the referendum. They are also supported by smaller parties. The FLN and the RND are both under new leadership. Former RND leader and ex-Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia was jailed for corruption, together with former cabinet ministers and senior officials of both parties. Opposition has come from across the political spectrum. Although Hirak does not not have a formalised leader, many protesters oppose the referendum because they say it does not deliver ""real change"" and have been calling on social media for ""all the political elite"" associated with the ousted president to be kicked out. The major Islamic parties - including the Movement for the Society of Peace (MSP), the Movement for Justice and Development and the Nahda movement - have dubbed the proposed constitutional amendments as ""against the Islamic values of the Algerian society"", and back a ""no"" vote. The Pact for a Democratic Alternative (PAD) - a group of political parties, rights organisations and activists - has also rejected what it sees as referendum on an ""imposed constitution"". What is needed, PAD says, is ""democratic and independent"" transition. Why is turnout a concern? The Algerian authorities seem to have taken a big gamble with this referendum for a new constitution. Its instigator, President Tebboune, is out of the country being treated for an undisclosed illness. Authorities and experts fear a second wave of coronavirus, which coupled with existing restrictions, may well put voters off from leaving home on polling day. President Tebboune was himself elected amid the lowest turnout Algeria has ever seen.",Algerians are voting in a referendum that is meant to cement changes made possible after long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was forced to resign last year.
"Last April, a Cairo appeals court upheld the sentence given to Ahmed Maher, Ahmed Douma and Mohamed Adel for taking part in an unauthorised protest. Tuesday's ruling by the Court of Cassation meant all legal avenues had now been exhausted, their lawyer said. The men came to prominence during the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak. Mr Maher and Mr Adel were founding members of the 6 April Youth Movement, which led many of the mass protests, while Mr Douma was a prominent blogger. Crackdown The three were arrested after protesting outside parliament on 30 November 2013 against the passing of a law requiring authorisation for public gatherings of more than 10 people. The next month they were convicted of participating in an unauthorised protest and assaulting police, and sentenced to three years in jail. They were also fined 50,000 Egyptian pounds (£4,400; $6,700). Correspondents say the Court of Cassation's ruling is likely to ignite further criticism of the anti-protest law and alleged police brutality in its implementation. It comes two days after at least 20 people died in clashes with police at protests marking the anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising. The restrictions on protests were instituted by the interim government that took power after the military overthrew Mr Mubarak's successor, Mohammed Morsi, in July 2013 after mass protests against his rule. A crackdown on Mr Morsi's Islamist supporters since then has seen more than 1,400 people killed and 16,000 others detained, activists say.",Three Egyptian activists have lost their final appeal against three-year prison sentences they were handed in 2013 for violating an anti-protest law.
"It is an ignominious look for the elegant statue, which has gazed wistfully across the water for more than a century. But it is also not the worst thing that has happened to the mermaid in its history. In fact, it's not even the first time she has been vandalised in the last month. The Little Mermaid has been decapitated (twice), had her arm sawn off and been blown up. And, to add insult to injury, she has even found herself banned from Facebook for breaching its nudity guidelines. So how did one of the world's most iconic statues become a focus for vandalism and protest? Blown up, beheaded - survived Sculptor Edvard Eriksen could not have imagined what would befall his statue, inspired by the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale, when it was commissioned in 1909. Four years later, the 175kg (385lb) bronze statue was presented to the city of Copenhagen, and it was decided she would be place at Langelinje Pier, watching over the harbour and its ships. And, for the next half century, she was fine. But then, in April 1964, the Little Mermaid was attacked for the first time: beheaded with a hacksaw. Her head, and the perpetrator of this vicious attack, disappeared into the night, never to be seen again. More than three decades later, the artist Jorgen Nash said he was behind the decapitation. It was, he claimed in 1997, carried out in a fit of rage after the love of his life left him. However, he was certainly not the only person to confess to the crime. The Little Mermaid is Denmark's most famous sculpture - its very own Statue of Liberty - and there were lots of people willing to take the blame for the ""murder"", apparently in return for their own moment in the limelight. But while they may have been willing to take the blame, it was another 20 years before someone had the audacity to attack the statue once more. This time, her arm was sawn off. But this was no political protest. Instead, it appears to have been the act of two drunken young men who shamefacedly returned the appendage two days later. Just six years after this, another attempt was made to remove the Little Mermaid's replaced head. It was unsuccessful, but left her with a deep ""wound"" in her neck. Then, in 1998, a third attempt to decapitate the statue was made. As in 1964, the culprits successfully made off with the head. Her beheading was not taken lightly: murder squad detectives were drafted in to attempt solve the mystery. It looked like they might have found their culprits with relative ease: within days, the previously unheard of Radical Feminist Fraction said they had done it to ""create a symbol of sexually fixated and misogynist male dream of women as bodies without heads"". But Danish police weren't convinced, and as in previous decapitations, the identity of the vandal remains a mystery. However, the head was returned, left outside a Danish television centre anonymously - and so was in place when someone blew her off her rock five years later. In September 2003, and the grand old age of 90, she was found floating face down in the harbour. This time the attack was rumoured to have been the work of anti-war protesters, angry at Danish involvement in Iraq. But again, despite the murder squad's best efforts to discover the identity of the culprits, exactly who they were - and what their motives were - remain a mystery. For the last 14 years, the statue has managed to keep herself in one piece. She has, however, worn a burqa, held a sex toy and been covered in paint - twice this year alone. At least the motives for the vandalism have become clearer in recent years: for example, the burqa was a statement against Turkey joining the EU, and the red paint of two weeks ago was in protest at whaling in the Faroe Islands. This latest act of vandalism was accompanied by the words ""Befri (sic) Abdulle"", or ""Free Abdulle"". It is not entirely clear, but appears to reference the case of 36-year-old Abdulle Ahmed, a Somali citizen who has spent more than decade at a Danish psychiatric hospital, allegedly forced to take medication over reported violence against caregivers. Will it be the last? It seems unlikely as making a political statement is all the more effective if made on one of the city's top tourist attractions. But Copenhagen's mayor for culture, Carl Christian Ebbesen, has a simple suggestion for how it could be prevented in the future: CCTV. ""I believe that video surveillance can help to have a preventive effect and gather evidence, if it should happen again,"" he told Danish news site DR.dk [in Danish].",Copenhagen awoke to the news that the Little Mermaid - the Danish capital's most famous statue - had been covered in blue and white paint.
"Svetlana Cameron said her painting, depicting traditional Manx dancers, ""represents the culture and identity of the island"". Ms Cameron, who has a studio in the Isle of Man, has two works shortlisted in the United States competition which attracted 2,500 entries. ""I am absolutely delighted,"" she said. She said she was inspired after attending the open-air sitting of the world's oldest parliament in 2013.

Many of the shortlisted works will be exhibited in a travelling exhibition that will start at the MEAM Museum in Barcelona in November. Ms Cameron said: ""The recognition fuels my enthusiasm and gives me confidence to carry on working in this very challenging genre.""

"Amid the beating of drums and shouting of slogans, hundreds of thousands of people, wearing saffron caps, cheered Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his convoy travelled seven kilometres in two hours for his road show. They wore ""Modi forever"" t-shirts and showered rose petals on him. Mr Modi was on his way to file his nomination in Varanasi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, seeking to become the ancient city's representative in parliament for a second time. But an opposition leader promptly complained to the poll watchdog - the Election Commission of India - alleging that the road show had exceeded the amount of money candidates are allowed to spend on their entire campaign. That limit is seven million rupees ($100,000; £77,500). The tightening noose ""The big festival"" or the ""festival of democracy"" is how the Election Commission is describing India's ongoing general election, the country's 17th since independence. But it's an old cliche because the so-called festive election is no longer quite so festive. With every election, the Election Commission has become stricter about how much money individual candidates spend on their campaigns. The noose has tightened so much that even if you were to look for it, you will rarely find any street-level campaigning now. The posters, wall paintings, flags and buntings, loudspeakers blaring music, and the noisy processions have all but disappeared. In 2010, then Chief Election Commissioner, SY Quraishi, created a new department to monitor expenditure and framed new rules. Since then, candidates have had to inform the commission in advance about how they will spend their money - and they have to be meticulous. How many vehicles will they use for campaigning? How many public meetings are being organised? How many posters and banners are being put up? Writing on walls is not allowed any more because that would be defacement of public or private property; and the use of plastic buntings is discouraged because the environment matters. ""Flying squads,"" ""static surveillance teams"" and ""video surveillance teams"" now go around each constituency in a cat and mouse chase, taking down unauthorised posters and recording expenses that were not approved in ""shadow registers"". Rates for every kind of expense are fixed (six rupees to rent a plastic chair or 100 rupees per plate for a meal). There's even a team to investigate if a newspaper article is in fact ""paid news""- basically an advertisement masquerading as news - and the expense is added to the candidate's account. Empty account books This is a noble effort to make sure the election is a level playing field, and wealthier candidates don't have an undue advantage. But seven million rupees is also too little money to campaign before 1.65 million voters - that's the average population of a parliamentary constituency in India. India votes 2019 To put this into perspective, consider this: It costs five rupees to send a letter by post to each voter in a constituency - that alone could cost more than eight million rupees overall. The expenditure limit was raised in 2014 and has since not even been adjusted for inflation. No-one can make a case to increase the limit because most candidates claim to have spent far less than seven million rupees. So many show artificially low figures fearing that the Election Commission will add expenses that it observed independently. In truth, it would be rare for a candidate to win a parliamentary seat without having spent several times over the official limit. As a result, all that candidates need to do, is hide their expenses from the Commission's monitoring teams. Should the Commission estimate that a candidate exceeded the limit, he or she could be disqualified even after winning the election at any point during their five-year term. Rarely has anyone been disqualified, but it has happened and the fear hangs like a sword over candidates. Underground campaign The result of this is that street-level campaigning - once so visible - has gone underground. Candidates are widely known to distribute cash and free alcohol, often in the dead of the night, in exchange for votes - although research suggests that bribes don't actually win votes. Officials have been catching and confiscating ever larger amounts of illicit cash and alcohol - they have seized more than $470m worth of cash, alcohol, drugs and gold in connection with the election since 26 March, according to the Election Commission's data. Even if officials occasionally turn a blind eye or miss something, the candidate's opponents may still file an official complaint. And then there's the media. So contestants take no chances and instead find ways to try and get around the spending limit. For example, if a candidate intends to use five cars to campaign, she would be given as many stickers that authorise each vehicle for campaign purposes. If a vehicle that was not authorised is used, officials could impound it. In practice, candidates use many more vehicles but without the party flag adorning the bonnets. That's how they can claim that the vehicle was not used for campaigning. So money is still being spent on the vehicle but it now looks like any other vehicle on the road, robbing the election of its sound and colour. Mr Quraishi, who enacted many of these rules, counters that the real festival is in the voter turnout, which has been rising. ""It has gone up from 35% back in the day to around 70% these days. Who says the festival is dead? It's just a more disciplined one and many voters have appreciated that candidates don't deface the facades of their homes anymore."" Individuals over masses To be sure, campaign finance regulations are not the only reason the colour has gone out of elections in India. Like elsewhere in the world, technology is also responsible. With the increasing penetration of cable TV and smartphones with cheap data, campaigning is targeting individuals over masses. Digital marketing agencies are thriving, bringing ruin to companies that specialise in making election merchandise. It helps that spending on micro-targeting is easier to hide from the Election Commission's ever vigilant eyes. Digital spends are tough to track and avoid the hassle of having to take prior permission, which slows down the campaign. Targeting voters individually also seems to have a better return on investment for candidates. Simon Chauchard, a political scientist at Columbia University in New York, has spent time asking Indian politicians how they spend their money to win votes. ""Most candidates also invest in more individualised strategies online - for instance, local WhatsApp networks - but also offline,"" he says. ""There is now a sense that one cannot just drop by in a helicopter and give a speech. One needs to canvass, meet voters in person and at least pretend to listen to them."" Ironically, while individual candidates are so limited, there is no limit on the amount of money that political parties can spend on the campaign, defeating the purpose of ensuring a level playing field. Parties refuse to even entertain the idea of such curbs. This financial asymmetry has ended up making Indian elections more presidential. While top leaders like Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi address mammoth rallies across India, the campaign has all but disappeared from street corners.","Indian elections have long been billed as a colourful and raucous exercise in democracy. But that has changed over the years because of stricter campaign rules and spending limits, says Shivam Vij."
"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday promoted Mr Wyatt to an aged care and indigenous health portfolio, following a government reshuffle triggered by an expenses scandal. ""His extensive knowledge and experience as a senior public servant in indigenous health, coupled with his work as an assistant minister in this portfolio, makes him an ideal minister for this area,"" Mr Turnbull said. Greg Hunt, who takes up health and sport in the reshuffle, described Mr Wyatt's appointment as a ""signature moment for Australia"". Mr Wyatt said he was deeply honoured to take on ""two crucial portfolios"". Maiden speech A former teacher and public servant, Mr Wyatt joined the Liberal Party before claiming the Western Australian seat of Hasluck by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2010. In his maiden speech to parliament, Mr Wyatt, wearing a kangaroo skin coat, credited education with offering him the chance to succeed in life. ""I have been a battler for most of my life but I have always driven myself to be successful in order to achieve my dreams,"" he said. During the speech he thanked Kevin Rudd, a former Labor prime minister, for his 2008 official apology to the Stolen Generations - the thousands of indigenous children who were forcibly removed from their families by successive governments until the late 1960s. Mr Wyatt's mother, Mona, was among them. ""My mother and her siblings, along with many others, did not live to hear the words delivered in the apology, which would have meant a great deal to them individually,"" Mr Wyatt said, adding he shed tears during the apology. He also paid tribute to his father, Don, who served in World War Two before working on West Australia's railways, for helping to raise the family's 10 children. Parliamentary career Mr Wyatt was returned to his seat in federal elections in 2013 and 2016, and was appointed the assistant minister for health and aged care in September 2015. His electorate covers a 1,192 sq km (460 sq miles) area extending from Perth's east. He backed the rise of Mr Turnbull, who ousted predecessor Tony Abbott in 2015, but has praised Mr Abbott's work in indigenous affairs. Mr Wyatt has supported the push to recognise indigenous Australians in the constitution. He has resisted calls within his own party to repeal a controversial racial discrimination law that makes it illegal to ""offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate"" people on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin. Despite making a strong argument against the push in August, Mr Wyatt has since made comments suggesting he could be prepared to support it. The Guardian said Mr Wyatt was one of five current indigenous Australians in parliament, along with Labor politicians Pat Dodson, Malarndirri McCarthy and Linda Burney, and independent Jacqui Lambie.","Ken Wyatt, the first indigenous Australian to enter Australia's House of Representatives, has now become its first indigenous minister."
"A mother who lost her son and a mother whose son is returning to school gave the BBC harrowing accounts of what happened that day, and what life holds for them now. Some readers may find some of the following details upsetting and graphic. Samya Salman's son 14-year-old Aamish was killed in the attack. She describes what happened that day and how she finds the strength to carry on. It was a day like any other and we were busy getting ready for my sister's wedding. I had no idea about anything until my cousin called me in a panic asking me where Aamish was and whether he was in school or not. She told me to put the TV on and I saw that there was an attack on Aamish's school. I couldn't comprehend - I thought they must be keeping them hostage. We searched for him all day: in hospitals, in the park behind the school, in houses near the school, everywhere. We couldn't find him anywhere. At 16:30 that day my husband called: ""Just rest your mind,"" he said, ""I'm bringing the body back home."" It was because of the the injury on his finger that we knew. My brother-in-law recognised him from a cut he got a few days ago, but there was a massive hole in his palm from a gunshot. His face was fine, mostly. One bullet entered through his jaw and exited his neck. 'I'm late for school!' I had wanted Aamish to take a day off from school so he could come with me as I was shopping for my sister's wedding but my husband said he would be missing too many school days. He got Aamish up for school, slowly stroking his hair till he woke up. I asked Aamish to have breakfast before he left, but he said: ""How can you ask me to have breakfast when I'm late for school?"" But he had breakfast and ran out of the door in a hurry. How was I to know I would never see him again? He loved sports and maths. And the family loved him. He used to hang out with the neighbourhood kids. He used to go off-roading with his uncles. He was getting into hunting too and loved cars. He lived so large and I believe he lived his life to the full these last few years. He loved music too. He used to come into my room, put on his earphones, and listen to this song, called ""Just Don't Cry"". I used to hate that song. And now I listen to it and sense that he was trying to tell me something. 'I have his shoe' A friend of Aamish's said he saw him run out of the school but then he stopped and ran back inside the school. I don't know why he would run back in. Maybe he went to save someone. I don't know what he was thinking. One of his teacher's said Aamish came back into the auditorium and they shot him then. They shot him on his left side nine times. From head to toe. He probably didn't even have a minute to breathe and understand what was happening. I have his shoe. They have blood clots in them. But I don't want his blood wasted. I want change in Pakistan. I have a 10-year-old son who goes to another school but now I would never consider putting him in this school. My daughters are in the girls' section and they don't want to go back. I still see Aamish running around. When I'm alone, I can't think. I think I will go mad. But then I think of Allah. And I will ask him to give me strength. We need a lot of patience. All us mothers. But I hope our government realises what has happened. I hope they do something. In today's Pakistan everyone is just thinking of themselves. If we don't fix ourselves and take care of each other, our enemies will always find us to be an easy target. 'We have no answers' The authorities tell school principals to secure their schools and to safeguard the children. What are they supposed to do? Should they start teaching children in schools how to defend themselves with guns. Should they teach them how to pull the trigger instead of the alphabet. I recall my childhood. Things were never like this. I never saw bombings. I remember one bombing when I was in third grade. But now, it's normal to discuss death. Our kids discuss death all the time. And we have no answers for them. Interview by the BBC's Shaan Khan. Mohammad, 17, stayed at home that day. His mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, describes the prospect of sending him back to the school where his friends were killed. After hearing about the attack a chill went through my spine. I don't know how to say this, but somehow a part of me was also peaceful with the feeling that my son was at home. His examination schedule gave him a day off but dozens of friends and fellow students lost their lives. When I returned home I found him weeping. At that moment I did not feel that I loved my son any more than I loved these kids - all his school friends who had died. My son is wise and brave and he says he is not afraid now. He says he would have tried to save his fellow friends and teachers if he had been there. This incident has brought us all together in grief. Everybody's heart is broken. When I am sending my kids to school I have two different feelings. Being a teacher and a Pakistani my feelings are that I and my children are ready to sacrifice our lives for this country. I want to send my children to school and make them so brave that they can defend this motherland. But I am a mother too and and when that part of me thinks about sending my children to school my heart sinks. No mother should see the day when parents and siblings are rushing to the scene of a massacre. They blasted mothers' hearts Those kids who lost their lives were the Abdus Salams' [Pakistani physicist who won Nobel prize] and Bill Gates of the future. But after seeing their innocent bodies riddled with bullets and covered in blood I just want to have my children alive rather than worry about their future prospects. But I have to send them to school. And then I find myself wishing that I can go with them to school and stay with them until they finish and then bring them back myself. I have two children: when they go to school my body and soul will be divided with them. My son faces renewed sadness when he goes back to his old playing grounds. He will not think about games but about bloodshed now. I am lucky and thank Allah for not putting me through this ordeal directly. At the same time I can feel for those mothers whose dreams have been shattered. On 17 December when my son told me he was going to attend the funeral prayer of his friends I was shaken to the core. This was not his age to attend funeral prayers of his friends. Bomb blasts in Peshawar are not new but this time they blasted mothers' hearts. I don't know how they can heal. Interview by BBC Urdu's Haroon Rashid.",Pupils are returning to a school in Peshawar that witnessed a massacre last month in which more than 150 students and teachers were killed.
"Mr Tytler denies any wrongdoing and in March 2009, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cleared him. But after an ensuing outcry, his party dropped him as a candidate for the general elections that year. In 2013, a Delhi court ordered the CBI to investigate the allegations against Mr Tytler once more. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew North, Mr Tytler said he was actually with Indira Gandhi's body in mourning at the key time when he is accused of instigating violence. Below are some edited excerpts from the interview. Were you involved in instigating the mobs that killed thousands of Sikhs in November 1984? First of all, this question is not the right one because I am nowhere involved and nowhere has my name been mentioned. All this perception created by the media is a different thing. The reality is, the court says, the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] says ""I am not involved"". Where has this perception come from? The perception came from the Nanavati Commission [set up to investigate the 1984 riots], after 2008. From 1984 to 2007 my name never came up. I was a minister for 11 years and I got elected four times in Sikh-dominated constituencies and I never lost. If I was guilty, people would never have elected me. Then why have there been investigations into you since? Why do people still say they saw you at those riots? At the Nanavati Commission, one application was completely false. The second was from Surinder Singh, the main man with whom this whole thing has been built. He says Mr Tytler came and instigated the crowd to go in the gurdwara [Sikh temple] and kill people. Now, the president and the secretary of the gurdwara say it's a wrong statement. Then Mr Surinder Singh says ""I was made to write this because I will get compensation"". So this is a concocted story and I am suffering from this wrong perception. I am a victim of my enemies, maybe within my own party, but I am also a big threat to the [main opposition] BJP. Every known leader of the BJP I have defeated, so they are scared. If you are innocent of these charges, why did the Congress party withdraw your candidacy at the last elections in 2009? They did not say this. This is the interesting part. I was given a ticket. Then one journalist in the press conference of the home minister threw a shoe and there was uproar. So the perception was created that why Mr Tytler - and my colleague Sajjan Kumar - why have they been given tickets? In this kind of atmosphere, it was harming the party and letting the Congress president [Sonia Gandhi] feel embarrassment and especially the prime minister, who is himself a Sikh - whether Mr Tytler is guilty or not guilty. But I accepted this thing with all my humility. So you must be angry then with the Congress party for not standing by you? No, no. It is not like that. What happened is a shameful thing. [The] '84 [riot] is not something anybody can be proud of. And I still say: 'the guilty should be hanged, not punished, should be hanged'. But when this kind of thing happens, I am not above the party. The party has given me a lot. It appears the Congress party do not want to stand by you? No, no. I am very proud of my party. We are not above all these things. The party has made me four times a member of parliament. They have given me so much. When the time came that the party is getting a bad name, then this was a small thing to do for the party. But we would never do anything like this [take part in 1984 riots]. But such an impression was created that one day my own daughter asked me: ""Papa have you killed Sikhs?"" Can you imagine how shamed we felt if my own daughter can think like this? So it is important that it is proved that I am not involved. But there are still cases being pursued against you - it hasn't gone away, has it? Excuse me, there is not a single case, not a single case since 1984 till today. Even today there is not a single case. There is an investigation into two affidavits, one has been proven false; the other man himself says that he was made to do it. There is no case. You must get this correct. How can there be a case when there is no complaint? But I'm struck by the fact that you let the Congress party off, you don't blame them, but it looks like at the very least you have been used as a scapegoat by the Congress party? No, no. Not a scapegoat. The party is bigger than me. I had my work. So you had to fall on your sword, for the Congress party? Yes, well I felt why not. Party gives you everything. Party gives me respect. Party gives me everything that I am today.","Jagdish Tytler, a former Delhi MP and minister, is among the Congress party members accused of leading the mobs during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots."
"The States will ask people for their views on how to control population levels ahead of a debate in March. Assistant Chief Minister, Senator Paul Routier, says every idea to deal with the situation will be considered. Gerard Fletcher, from the Jersey Hospitality Association, says it is vital people not from Jersey continue to work on the island. The annual social survey, published in December 2012, found people wanted the government to tackle migration as a priority ahead of providing affordable homes and jobs. A new population model published by the States in September 2012 showed that there could be 120,000 people living in Jersey by 2035. The latest figures, from June 2012, showed there were about 98,000 people living in Jersey. Population cap Senator Routier said a population cap was not out of the question. He said: ""There is a mixed message which needs to be got out, there is an opportunity for people to come to the island as long as they are bringing value to the island. ""I think we are going to look at all options whether it be a cap or whether it be a more open policy, it is just about finding what the population wants."" Environmental campaigner, Dr Mark Forskitt, said the island had reached saturation point in population growth. He said he was shocked by the figures and concerned at the strain it would put on island services.",Jersey's population could be capped as the government reviews how many people can live and work on the island.
"The States is due to debate a transfer to island-wide voting in February, with two alternatives on offer. One involves a pan-island contest for all 45 seats, while the other would see 10 island-wide seats alongside 35 from the current district vote. Deputy Jane Stephens said voters needed a user-friendly system. She said: ""From a purely democratic view, and I think many voters feel this, it would be good to be able to achieve an island-wide voting system, but it has to be simple and be easy for people to operate."" Independent political analyst Dr Adrian Lee said the issue had been unresolved ever since the abolition of conseillers in 2000. Conseillers, of which there had been 10, were voted for island-wide, while other members were elected from districts. He said another inconclusive debate on Guernsey's voting system could be the worst possible outcome for the island. Dr Lee said: ""A lot of surveys have indicated that Guernsey's electorate really want all-island representation - the question is how to get it."" He said the proposals did not make clear the details of how it could be done.","Any changes to Guernsey's election procedures need to result in a simple system, according to a St Sampson's deputy."
"The sculpture of Sir George Carteret, a 17th Century bailiff and lieutenant governor of Jersey, was targeted on Wednesday night. Some had called for the removal of the statue in St Peter's square due to Sir George's role in the Royal African Company (RAC), a group of merchants that traded slaves in West Africa. Jersey Police said it was being treated as a case of malicious damage. Some statues in the UK have been removed or are being reviewed as a result of anti-racism protests. Deputy Montford Tadier said: ""George de Carteret was somebody who made his profit off the back of dehumanising other human beings and trading them as slaves. ""So it's quite right, in the modern day context, that we question why a statue was put up to him by the constable of St Peter in 2014."" Prof William Pettigrew, of Lancaster University, described the RAC as ""the single most prolific trader of slaves"". The company, funded by Sir George and others, transported about 150,000 slaves from West Africa to the Caribbean in the 17th Century. ""There's no doubt he knew exactly what his money was going towards,"" Prof Pettigrew said. Sir George Carteret The former Constable of St Peter, John Refault, said he had commissioned the statue to acknowledge ""probably the most important"" person in Jersey's history. ""I don't think we should forget the bad, because remembering the bad stops us from doing the same thing over again,"" he said.",The statue of a slave trader in Jersey has been covered with white paint.
"By Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News Around dinner tables in Arkansas and Alabama, at rallies in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and on plane journeys to New Hampshire and Nevada, I've been gauging views in more than 20 states. So how do people rate the Trump presidency so far? We contacted 100 people who had spoken to the BBC during the primaries, campaign and beyond. Our #Trump100 focus group consisted of 50 who had voted for Mr Trump, and 50 who didn't. Judging by the responses, there is still a huge divide in the way Americans view issues like immigration, abortion and the role of government - and those views remain deeply entrenched. The strike on Syria was one of the few areas which didn't elicit a partisan response, with some Trump voters disagreeing with it and some Clinton voters supporting the action. Healthcare and tax reform were two policy areas mentioned the most frequently. Both issues are priorities for President Trump and are among the most challenging in his in-tray. Overall, those who voted for Mr Trump think he's doing a fantastic job. For those who didn't, the needle has barely changed - some even want him impeached. Here is what some of them told us about his first 100 days. Jan Berry, 58, Arkansas When I met Jan Berry at her home in Arkansas back in October, she had nothing good to say about Donald Trump. A lifelong Republican and a committed Christian, she felt her party's nominee was boorish and brash. But despite her reservations, she cast a ballot for Mr Trump. ""I did a lot of soul searching, and the thing that helped me make the decision had to do with Hillary Clinton's views on abortion,"" she says. ""I haven't really regretted my vote, even though there are lots of things Mr Trump has done that are ridiculous and embarrassing,"" she says. His decision to nominate conservative justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a reason Berry, along with many other reluctant Trump voters we spoke to, still backs him. Highs: Appointing Gorsuch and picking non-politicians for his cabinet. ""At first I wasn't sure about Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, as he was from Exxon, but I've been so impressed with him,"" she says. Lows: His refusal to shake Angela Merkel's hand in the Oval Office. ""I thought that was about the lowest thing he's done, in front of the whole world. It just embarrassed me."" What voters told us when we followed up with them in 2017 Voters talk to the BBC: Ally Bross, 18, Florida A first-time voter and student at Florida International University, Ally Bross was one of the youngest supporters of Mr Trump I met, and one of the most emphatic. As a native of Orlando, Ally saw the Pulse nightclub shooting harden her political views. ""When Trump said we're going to fix terrorism, we are going to put an end to Isis, I was all for it,"" she says. But the elation she felt in November evaporated after the president's strike against a Syrian airbase. ""I feel like he's putting us in the middle of a war,"" she says. She is concerned that there will be more action to come against North Korea. Ally broadly supported the travel ban, but is unhappy with the way it was rolled out. As a student at a diverse university, she saw friends struggle to get back into the country with their green cards. ""It shouldn't have been so strict. You can't just block everybody out,"" she says. ""I don't want America to become that"". Highs: ""I love that he helped Flint, Michigan after they had a crisis with their water,"" she said, referring to a $10m grant for Flint awarded by Trump's Environmental Protection Agency, which had been approved by President Obama. Lows: Aside from the Syria strike, Ally is disappointed that the president failed to repeal and replace Obamacare. ""I think the government needs to get their butts out of our health care"". Lori Hack, 45, Arizona Lori Hack couldn't bring herself to vote for Donald Trump, even though she is an active member of the Republican party. ""My issue back then was that [Trump] had no record to back up what he was saying,"" she says. Lori initially expressed concerns about the president's lack of experience in governing, but is coming around. ""Being a president is different to running a company,"" she says. ""I think he's realised this is not a joke."" Lori is also impressed by his ""phenomenal"" choice of Neil Gorsuch and his unrelenting stance on immigration. ""He talked about sending people back across the border if they were here illegally, and he's doing that too"". Highs: President Trump's action on immigration. ""It's about securing the border,"" Lori, who supports the border wall, says. ""If you want to come in you'll have to go through the front door, the back door needs to be sealed."" Lows: ""I'm disappointed he's got his daughter and son-in-law in the White House - they're Democrats and their positions are more liberal."" More from the BBC: Sean Kehren, 22, Minnesota Sean Kehren's tears for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic convention made him an instant social media star as the Crying Peter Pan Man. When I met Sean then, he was sad to see Mr Sanders miss out on becoming the Democratic nominee, but ready to shift his support to Hillary Clinton. ""I didn't think we had the most charismatic candidate but her policies were things I cared about,"" he says. Sean accepts that Donald Trump won the electoral college, but wonders whether it was with the help of ""outside forces,"" namely Russia. Sean is now working full time as a political organiser, and has his eyes on the 2018 mid-term elections. ""Democrats need to keep up the pressure at town halls and have our voices heard."" Highs: Sean struggles to list any accomplishments, but does feel that son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka are ""steadier hands"" in the White House, even if they lack experience. Lows: Hiring right-wing advisers like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka. ""They've all studied how, when populations get into a reactionary mood, how you can really change a country."" James Montfort III, 60, Virginia I met James while he was volunteering for the Trump campaign in Virginia. Despite pollsters saying otherwise, he never doubted Mr Trump would win. ""I have never been so elated in my entire life,"" he says. ""I thank God, the saviour."" James, a former banker, is pleased with President Trump's first few months in the White House. He believes his meetings with everyone from the President of China to the Congressional Black Caucus show a willingness to be open and transparent. James is less concerned about how transparent the president's taxes are. ""The IRS already scrutinised his tax returns. If there was anything bad in them they would have caught them,"" he says. Highs: James supports the president's regular trips to Florida. ""I think Mar-A-Lago is a beautiful and wonderful place to bring foreign dignitaries."" Lows: The roll out of the travel ban - a common complaint from Trump supporters. ""It had hiccups,"" he says. ""I blame his advisers."" Beth Howard, 54, Iowa Beth Howard lives in rural Iowa, and bakes pies so delicious, she's made them her living. I got to sample her pastry prowess in January 2016, ahead of the Iowa caucus. She hosted a discussion around her kitchen table with both Republicans and Democrats. Beth was a passionate Hillary Clinton supporter, and like many Democrats in our #Trump100 panel, she struggles to find any positives in the Trump presidency. ""I'm a lot more pessimistic than I was before."" Along with tens of thousands of other women, Beth travelled to Washington DC to take part in the Women's March in January. It was the first time she participated in a political protest. Since the election she has also started baking what she describes as ""protest pies"" and volunteering with refugee and immigration assistance groups in Iowa, to help those she believes have been adversely affected by the president's policies. Those who support Mr Trump's agenda so far ""care more about money than people,"" she says. Beth was also unhappy that the president has brought his family members to work in the White House, ""These people aren't qualified to run our country,"" she says. Highs: She was unable to think of anything. Lows: She feels Mr Trump has destroyed America's reputation in the world. ""It's just this American cowboy mentality and arrogance that upsets me the most."" Marco Gutierrez, 43, California As the founder of Latinos for Trump, Marco Gutierrez faced criticism from friends and family, but he remains a firm supporter of Donald Trump. While many #Trump100 voters we've spoken to have concerns about the president's Tweets, Marco believes some of his more controversial online tirades, like unfounded accusations President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, were borne out of vigilance. ""I think he was seeing all these leaks being reported, and wanted to see how far it went,"" he says. ""He was testing the market, like a businessman,"" Marco supports the president's immigration policies, but believes there is room for improvement when it comes to the way deportations are handled. ""You have innocent people who are caught in the crossfire - [Mr Trump] needs to be compassionate because I think eventually some supporters will break."" Marco says he will stay loyal to the president, but is concerned by a small hardcore element of the president's supporters he describes as ""borderline racist"". Highs: ""The way they launched the missiles while he was having dinner with the Chinese president, is something I admire a lot,"" Marco says. ""He is showing fortitude."" Lows: ""I'm not very happy with his son-in-law, I think that there it is not an arms-length relationship, and that could be a conflict of interest."" Jim Mather, 57, Alabama Jim Mather is a pastor who works with international students at the University of Southern Alabama. It was around Jim's kitchen table in March 2016 that I discussed immigration policy with Mohammed, a Syrian refugee, and Steve Weller, a Trump supporter. A Republican, Jim felt let down by a party ""overtaken by populism and nationalism,"" and voted instead for independent candidate Evan McMullin. Jim says the president's policies on refugees are ""belligerent and backwards"". Many foreign students are living in fear, he says, noting that there's been a drop in overseas enrolments to the university. ""Mr Trump seems to be making decisions that aren't based on reality. The international population and diversity in our country is a great source of wealth and culture to the United States. Jim supported the air strike against Syria, but remains concerned that without a wider strategy, the action could be seen as a stunt. ""It's more of a revelation of the character of Donald Trump,"" he says. ""One week Assad should stay in power, and the next week he bombs him."" Highs: The Gorsuch nomination. For many evangelical Christians this was the singular reason they voted for Mr Trump. Lows: Mr Trump's tone and demeanour to the rest of the world: ""Here's a man who is 70 years old, tweeting personal vendetta and snide remark ad nauseam. It's less than presidential."" I'll be tweeting more observations from our #Trump100 focus group throughout the week. You can follow me - and let me know what you think - at @BBCRajiniv.

"Loïc, 18, was desperate to take his baccalaureate exam on Monday after missing the bus, and so took the car. He reportedly lost control of the vehicle on a turn, hitting a guardrail on the opposite side of the road. After checking his condition, police in the small town of Albi delivered him to school just minutes before the exam. Officers from the local station in Albi, just north of Toulouse, reported in a Facebook post that they arrived at the scene of the accident to find Loïc ""unscathed"". The high school student was then given a breathalyser test for alcohol consumption, which he passed. Police said the teenager explained that he was keen to take the exam and that they had agreed that missing the test, which is required for students to graduate high school in France, would be ""unfortunate"". With just 10 minutes before it was due to start, arrangements were made for his father's vehicle and Loïc was asked to step into the police van. The teenager arrived with two minutes to spare, reportedly leaving his fellow students ""dumbfounded"". The Albi police said they all wished the high school student ""all the success he deserves"".

"The two sides are seeking to improve relations more than two decades after the conflict during the break-up of Yugoslavia. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic was quoted as saying that Serbia wished to become Bosnia's largest trading partner. Both countries aspire to European Union membership. Security has been tightened in Bosnia for the visit. In July, Mr Vucic was attacked by stone-throwing mourners at a commemoration service in Srebrenica, where thousands of Bosnian Muslims were massacred by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. More than 100,000 people were killed during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, during which Serbia backed Bosnian Serbs in their effort to secede and join Serbia. Mr Vucic is scheduled to return to Srebrenica on 11 November for a development conference. The joint session was expected to see agreements signed on the protection of cultural heritage, the search for missing persons, environmental protection and telecommunications. The two sides also discussed infrastructural and energy projects, including a Belgrade-Sarajevo railway, Serbian news agency Tanjug reported. Ahead of the joint session, Mr Vucic said that despite the arguments of ""hotheads"" on both sides, it was impossible for the two states to avoid cooperating with each other. He said they were ""so intertwined that we will have to be together for hundreds of years,"" according to Bosnia's private Onasa news agency. Denis Zvizdic, the chairman of Bosnia's Council of Ministers, was quoted as saying the visit was important not only for development but also ""in a symbolic sense"".",The Serbian and Bosnian governments have held their first joint session in Sarajevo.
"By Simon Atkinson BBC News, Sydney Australia's recent bushfires made climate change the country's most pressing issue. But scientists say that momentum risks being lost because of the virus. Instead, as Australia looks for ways to revive its economy, innovations around solar, wind and hydroelectric projects should be central, they say. The devastating summer of blazes - driven by drought and rising temperatures - killed 33 people and destroyed about 3,000 homes. Millions of hectares of bush, forest and parks burned. Prof Mark Howden of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University said memories of ""the droughts and the fires and the smoke haze across major cities have dissipated with the arrival of Covid-19"". ""And clearly the momentum for change in relation to climate here in Australia has dissipated quite considerably too."" 'Significant disruption is an opportunity' Australia contributes about 1.5% of the world's total carbon emissions. Fossil fuels it exports - mainly coal to China and India - make up another 3.6% when burned. Prof Howden told the BBC that reducing carbon emissions should be put front and centre of Australia's post-virus economic recovery plan. ""When you have significant disruption like this, it does give you an opportunity to move forward on a different trajectory from the one you're on previously,"" he said. While the use of renewables is increasing in Australia year-on-year - last year 24% of all electricity generated came from renewable sources - the current Liberal-National government has been notoriously reluctant to phase out coal in favour of cleaner options. Last year, it gave Indian company Adani the final approval for construction to begin on a controversial coal mine in Queensland. And a recent report suggested Australia was second only to China in the number of new coal-powered plants in development. Prof Matthew England of the Climate Change Research Centre said it would be "" disastrous"" if, once the pandemic is over, Australia throws money into ""lazy, low tech"" coal to get the economy moving again, ""because we know that those carbon emissions will change our planet's climate in very dangerous ways"". Australia is faring far better during the pandemic than many nations - with fewer than 6,800 confirmed cases and 83 deaths reported as of late April. Chief Australia Economist at BIS Oxford Economics, Sarah Hunter said the Australian government now had the ""headspace"" to focus on its long-term economic response. ""Serious discussion around energy policy"" should be part of measures to support recovery and growth, she said, especially while there was a a fairly ""co-operative environment"" between the government, opposition and industry. ""Obviously nobody wanted what's happening right now. But if it does mean that we get an acceleration of some of these reforms, that can be very positive in the long run."" 'Robust balance' of economy and climate So far Australia's economic response has centred around a A$130bn ($82bn: £66bn) support package - with a subsidy for employers to keep people in work. Prof Howden fears this may be short-sighted. ""Instead of putting money through businesses, essentially just to keep people in their current jobs or keep those job relationships going, we could put some of that money into nation-building activities, which reduce our emissions and give us future options,"" he said. ""This is exactly the time when we should be having those discussions and making those plans."" ""Once we're through the immediate effects of the coronavirus and the lockdown, in some ways that's going to be too late."" But Grattan Institute think tank energy director Tony Wood the best option for Australia was a ""robust balance"" of energy options. While he supported investment in gas and other sectors including hydrogen and batteries for electric vehicles, he argued more renewable energy projects do not make economic sense right now. ""I don't see why we should throw more money at more renewables"" Mr Wood told the BBC. ""I don't think it needs more subsidies or governments building wind and solar farms. They in themselves don't create many jobs beyond the construction phase, and even those jobs are not well paid."" 'Perfect storm' Ultimately, it may be cold hard economics rather than environmental concerns that bring most change. Ask me Share this Explainer With Australia's first recession in almost 30 years predicted as a result of the pandemic, analysts suggest this in itself could threaten the long-term future of many coal power stations. Lower demand from industry forcing down electricity prices for a prolonged period would make renewables a cheaper, more enticing option - what energy analyst group Reputex call ""a perfect storm for the wholesale electricity market"". Also potentially bringing down Australia's demand and therefore emissions, are behavioural changes picked up during lockdowns. As in other parts of the world, Australia has seen industry slow and air travel all but stop. Given that carbon stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years, this small blip is negligible, says Prof England, who expects to see pent up demand for travel and consumption post-lockdown. But he predicts, for example, that people flying between Sydney and Melbourne for short meetings will become less common once businesses see that video conferencing is just as effective. A new trust in experts? While more than 200,000 people worldwide have died from Covid-19, the World Health Organization forecasts that an additional 250,000 people will die each year from 2030 if global temperatures continue to rise. Despite such dire warnings, there are few signs that people will take climate as seriously as they have this pandemic. A poll last week from Ipsos Mori suggested only 57% of Australians felt government actions after the pandemic should prioritise climate change. ""We need to understand this is a huge problem that we're burdening our kids with,"" says Prof England. ""And even if it's not necessarily in your backyard, it will be at some stage. And the bushfires last summer, I hope, brought that home for Australians."" But he sees some cause for optimism. ""Climate change, unfortunately, has had three or four decades of the best scientific advice being ignored by many nations around the world in favour of some of the fossil fuel industry's push for longevity,"" he said. ""We've seen with this pandemic that those nations that took the expert advice seriously acted quickly and acted early are the ones who've best had been able to cope. ""Now, one of the big things that people realise is that listening to experts is a good thing to do.""","The Covid-19 pandemic is a ""huge opportunity"" to fast-track Australia's shift towards more renewable energy, climate scientists have told the BBC."
"It is a journey fraught with risk, braving the Aegean Sea, Balkan people smugglers and the long path over land through Europe.

Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your stories. Dinghy to Greece then fighting for a Macedonia train - by Chris Buckler, Lesbos Crossing into Europe often means crossing water for the refugees and migrants searching for a new life. Between Turkey and Greece that can be a short trip, but it is also a dangerous one, particularly for people who have no experience with boats. And many don't. Before dawn on Turkey's beaches it has become a regular sight to witness people struggling in the darkness with dinghies designed for tourists not travellers. Some are picked up by coastguard ships and there have been others lost to the sea. The relief is obvious for those who make it to the shores of islands like Kos and Lesbos, but for most that journey is just the beginning. They then have to register for documents that will allow them to travel on to other parts of Europe and get off the island. There are ships to Athens but many families want to go to elsewhere, and that means a long journey north out of the Greek capital, not just through EU countries but also the Balkans. Macedonia has struggled to cope with the influx of people from Greece, at one stage shutting borders and declaring a state of emergency. Macedonia's Gevgelija railway station just across the border has been the most obvious bottleneck. The migrants need to register at the police station there to get papers, which will allow them 72 hours to cross the country. There have been long queues resulting in further frustrating waits before they get the chance to board a train out of Gevgelija. Besides, there are regularly too many people for the carriages, leaving the police with the unenviable task of deciding who will be allowed to board and who will have to sleep another night on the platform. The tracks from here lead towards Macedonia's border with Serbia, another Balkan state on the increasingly well-trodden path through Europe. Respite in Serbia - by Guy Delauney, Belgrade The migrants' welcome has been much warmer in Serbia than in Macedonia. The authorities here have been preparing for an influx for months - and were ready with a temporary reception centre in the border town of Mitrovac as well as a more permanent facility in nearby Presevo. These were places where people could enjoy food, water and shelter - as well as receive documents granting them leave to stay in the country. Theoretically, they then have 72 hours to get to one of Serbia's five residential centres for asylum-seekers - but most just use the time to make their way to the border with Hungary, where they hope to cross into the European Union and the borderless Schengen Area. Western Balkans route 181,500 migrants have arrived in Greece by boat so far in 2015 3,000 expected to enter Macedonia daily 90,000 have passed through Serbia since January 80,000 asylum applications expected in Austria in 2015 800,000 asylum applications expected in Germany in 2015 Many first come to Belgrade, where they change buses, receive cash at money transfer offices or just take a break from a long and often dangerous journey. The square next to the main bus station has been an unofficial refugee centre for months. Small groups of well-dressed young men with rucksacks and women with headscarves were also relaxing in the central Tasmajdan park on Monday. Some were drying out their shoes in the sun, after a soaking on the Greek-Macedonian border. Serbia's refugee commissariat has registered 90,000 people with temporary ""leave to stay"" papers so far this year. But only around 500 have entered the country's asylum-seeking process. For the rest, a new life in such countries as Germany, Sweden or Norway is the dream. Migrant influx challenges Schengen accord Bypassing Hungary's new border fence - by Nick Thorpe, Roszke There's a mood of exhausted chaos at the roadside, where more than 100 Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis stretch out on the dry grass. Hungarian police stand guard, their smart blue uniforms and red caps in sharp contrast with the rags of the refugees. A police bus arrives and people line up to be taken to their first refugee processing centre nearby. Just across an open field, Hungary's new ""wire barrier"" glistens in the sunlight against the tall stalks of maize. It consists for now of coils of razor wire - the real fence comes later - and some migrants have just pushed it down or thrown blankets or sleeping bags over it, to lessen the danger of injury. But at this point on the border, most take the easier option, simply walking down a rarely-used railway line, which cuts a path through the fence. There, more policemen stand to welcome them in English - serious, but not unfriendly: ""Carry on down the track - one kilometre."" A bizarre contrast has emerged in Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis. While the government rages against ""illegal migrants"", police on the border continue to work under procedures in full harmony with their country's obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. ""Hungary police good. Serbia police good. Turkey and Iran police bad,"" explains a Syrian man in broken English. Budapest has three major stations - Keleti, Nyugati and Deli - (East, West and South) are almost overrun with asylum seekers. Some of the migrants do as they are told, travelling between refugee camps with documents that expire within 48 hours. But most look for trains, buses, taxis, or car-drivers who will take them to Austria or Germany. Read more: Hungary's double-sided response to migrant crisis Austria struggles with new arrivals - by Bethany Bell, Vienna Many of the migrants arriving in Austria hope to travel on to Germany and elsewhere in northern Europe. Officials in the German state of Bavaria say about 1,400 migrants have crossed the border every day - most of them from Austria. But, increasingly, people are claiming asylum in Austria - a country of 8.5 million people. Since May, an average of 2,000 people have claimed asylum here every week, according to interior ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck. In the first six months of this year, more than 28,000 people requested asylum - more than the total for the whole of 2014 - he told the BBC. That number is expected to rise to 80,000 by the end of the year. More than half the migrants come to Austria through neighbouring Hungary and the Balkans, by train, lorry or van. Groups of migrants, often with children, are becoming a common sight at Austrian railway stations. In recent days, there has been a spate of accidents in eastern Austria involving vans carrying migrants. Several people have been seriously injured. Some of the drivers were arrested on trafficking charges; others escaped. Austria's main asylum processing centre at Traiskirchen, south of Vienna, has been overcrowded for weeks. Hundreds of people, including children, have been forced to sleep outside, as the Austrian federal government and the provinces and municipalities wrangle over where they should be housed. Amnesty International recently condemned the conditions at Traiskirchen as ""shameful"", particularly for a rich country like Austria. Influx threatens to overwhelm German authorities - by Jenny Hill, Berlin To an onlooker, Germany's system appears dangerously chaotic; when I visited Berlin's reception centre hundreds of refugees stood for hours in intense midsummer heat waiting to be registered. A volunteer doctor running a makeshift surgery in a nearby tent told me the authorities had been surprised by this sudden influx of people. Put simply, here's what's supposed to happen to arrivals. First they register with one of the German states, which provide some money - thought to be around €140 a month (£101;$160) - and temporary accommodation while their asylum applications are processed, That takes, on average, seven months. If successful, the refugee is then found permanent accommodation by the state. But every state has its own procedures and its own problems. Most are struggling to house the high number of people arriving every day. Refugees are living in tents, converted warehouses, hotels. I met a Syrian man who pointed to his little girl and told me they had slept on the street for the last few days. Almost every day the German government reiterates two demands - for other EU member states, the UK included, to take more refugees and for the EU to agree a co-ordinated response to the crisis. Although attacks on asylum-seeker accommodation are rising, the numbers are relatively low and an extraordinary number of people here are giving up their time or their possessions to help the new arrivals. Germany's interior minister estimated last week that 800,000 people would seek asylum here this year. He told the BBC he was worried the prevailing attitude of welcome might change. Without the efforts of volunteers, it might struggle to cope. Have you made the journey to Germany or elsewhere in Europe? Let us know about your experiences.

"The agreement was made between Vietnamese Defence Minister Phung Quang Thanh and his visiting US counterpart, Leon Panetta. Mr Panetta was in Vietnam for a two-day visit to discuss military ties. They also conducted an unprecedented exchange of artefacts taken by soldiers from both nations during the war. Mr Panetta presented the diary of a Vietnamese soldier taken by US marines in 1966. In return, Mr Quang Thanh gave the defence secretary the personal letters of a US killed in action in 1969. Defence partnership US officials believe the three previously restricted areas that have now been opened up for excavation could be important in the hunt for missing servicemen. Two of the areas, in Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces, were the sites of suspected plane crashes during the war. The third site in Kon Tum province, near the borders with Laos and Cambodia, was the scene of a battle in 1968. The defence secretary said the US had an ""enduring commitment"" to build a strong defence partnership with Vietnam. His visit follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding on defence co-operation between the two former enemies last year. Correspondents say the meeting was an attempt to shore-up American power in the Asia-Pacific region in the face of growing Chinese influence.",Vietnam has said it will open up three new areas to American teams searching for US servicemen who went missing during the Vietnam war.
"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray stopped short of calling it a lockdown, but said for the next 15 days, only essential services would function. Mr Thackeray said gatherings of more than four and non-essential travel on public transport would be banned. ""The war has begun again,"" the chief minister said at a press conference. ""Now is the time for action,"" he added. ""I am not saying a lockdown just now, but strict restrictions. I know bread and butter is important but saving lives is important."" He also acknowledged the need for more oxygen, saying supplies would be sought through the military. Maharashtra is India's richest state and home to its biggest city, Mumbai. It has been the hardest hit in the nation by the coronavirus pandemic. The state reported 51,751 new Covid-19 cases on Monday and 258 deaths. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly asked specialist teams to visit the state to investigate why there has been such a dramatic spike in case numbers. The state announced tighter restrictions a week ago after India saw its highest day of infections since mid-September, with 93,249 new cases. More than half of those cases were in Maharashtra. Last week's new measures - including a night-time curfew and a ban on public gatherings - will remain during the new 15-day period. About 165,000 people are reported to have died of Covid-19 in India and there have been 12.5 million confirmed infections. The country's mass inoculation drive, the largest in the world, has proceeded at a slower than expected rate - about 100 million doses of the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines have been administered so far, but the government has said it wants to vaccinate 250 million people by July. Also on Tuesday, India authorised the emergency use of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and agreed to fast-track approval for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson shots. Sputnik V is the third drug to be approved by India after Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield and Covaxin, which was developed by Indian firm Bharat Biotech. Sputnik V's approval came as India overtook Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases globally. India has the largest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world and exported tens of millions of doses to smaller nations before a spike in cases increased domestic demand.","Maharashtra, the Indian state worst affected by the coronavirus, has announced sweeping new restrictions amid a wave of Covid-19 infections."
"Bars, restaurants and gyms must close by 22:00 and people can only meet in groups of 10 or less. The US is seeing a surge in coronavirus - a record 65,368 Americans were in hospital on Wednesday. The Covid Tracking Project also reported a record 144,270 new cases. An average of over 900 people a day are now dying with the disease. More than a million new cases in November pushed the total confirmed cases to over 10 million nationally, with 233,080 deaths so far. The US has been seeing more than 100,000 new cases per day over the last eight days in what experts say may be a worse outbreak than those seen in the spring and summer. Experts warn hospitals across the country could soon be overwhelmed. On Wednesday a member of President-elect Joe Biden's Covid-19 advisory panel said a four to six week lockdown could bring the pandemic under control. Dr Michael Osterholm said that the government could borrow enough money to cover lost income for businesses during a shutdown. What's happening in New York? ""We're seeing a national and global Covid surge, and New York is a ship on the Covid tide,"" state Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday. New measures come into effect on Friday affecting hospitality after Mr Cuomo said contact tracing identified late-night gatherings as key virus spreaders in the state. If the rate of spread of infection continued to rise, Mayor Blasio said the New York City's public school system would close and children would begin online classes. ""This is our last chance to stop a second wave. We can do it, but we have to act now,"" Mr de Blasio tweeted. New York City was badly hit by the virus earlier this year when nearly 18,000 people died with Covid-19 in March, April and May, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. What's the picture nationwide? States across the US have broken new case records this week with Texas becoming the first state to hit one million total cases on Tuesday. If Texas were a separate country, it would rank 11th in the world for most cases. Other states, including Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Florida, have also seen numbers rise. CBS News reports 15 states saw the numbers of patients in hospital due to the virus double in the last month. Some hospitals, such as in Idaho and Missouri, have had to turn patients away because they ran out of room. State leaders have been re-imposing pandemic restrictions as a result. Residents of Wisconsin and Nevada have been urged to stay at home for two weeks and in Minnesota, bars and restaurants must shut by 22:00. On Tuesday, Mr Osterholm warned of a ""perfect storm"". Speaking to CBS This Morning, Mr Osterholm said there was ""no question that our hospitals are about to be overrun"". He noted ""the darkest days of this pandemic between now and next spring"", before the vaccine arrives. Mr Osterholm, who heads the infectious disease research centre at the University of Minnesota, said during the summer spike after the Labour Day national holiday, new cases rose to 32,000 a day. ""Now we're running in the 120- to 130,000 cases a day,"" he said. ""Do not be at all surprised when we hit 200,000 cases a day."" The same day, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci offered some hopeful news. He said the new Covid vaccine by Pfizer was expected to go through an emergency authorisation process in the next week or so. Human trials suggest it is 90% effective. Dr Fauci told MSNBC: ""I'm going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer, I trust the [Food and Drug Administration]. These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists."" Amid the ongoing outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its research around masks, saying that wearing one not only protects others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. The CDC referenced several studies, including one case where two Covid-positive hair stylists interacted with 139 clients - but of the 67 clients researchers tested, none developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. Another study looking into the outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said.

"Mr Avenatti is charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars from Nike. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers are now demanding that he be transferred from the high security cell to a normal one ahead of his trial which could start next week. He served as lawyer for adult film star Stormy Daniels. She attempted to sue the president to get out of a non-disclosure agreement she signed before the 2016 election. Mr Avenatti was denied bail after prosecutors in California said he violated bail conditions in a separate criminal case. His lawyers claim he is in solitary confinement and under 24-hour lockdown in the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan. ""The temperature in his cell feels like it is in the mid-40s [Fahrenheit]. He is forced to sleep with three blankets. Not surprisingly, he has been having great difficulty functioning,"" a letter sent on Monday from his lawyers to the district judge said. They also said when visiting Mr Avenatti for a non-contact legal visit, it was difficult for him to review papers relating to his case as the glass partition had no window through which they could be passed. His lawyers had to ask prison staff to hand the documents to him. On Tuesday, the prison's warden said Mr Avenatti would be allowed to make phone calls and keep legal materials in his cell. ""Due to Mr Avenatti's high profile case, his notoriety, Mr Avenatti's placement is for his own safety,"" the warden said in an email to the district judge. The warden denied Mr Avenatti had been placed under ""special administrative measures"". Aside from the Nike trial, the lawyer has two other cases pending. One charges that he defrauded Stormy Daniels, allegedly taking money from her book deal, while another case in California alleges financial dishonesty in his dealings with clients. El Chapo last year described living in his cell at the Manhattan prison as ""psychological, emotional, mental torture 24 hours a day."" The prison also housed former inmate financier Jeffrey Epstein who committed suicide in his cell last year while awaiting trial on sexual abuse charges.","Lawyer Michael Avenatti is being held in a Manhattan prison cell which once housed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, his legal team claims."
"Opposition MPs physically tried to stop the vote in a legislative committee by jostling around the chairman and trying to snatch his paperwork and microphone. The committee's vote clears the way for the bill to go to the upper house of parliament for final approval. The opposition says it will continue to try to delay the vote. The bill would allow Japan to defend its allies overseas even when it is not under attack. The bill is not widely supported by the country at large. Thousands of protesters rallied outside the parliament in Tokyo as the committee debate was under way. Opposition lawmakers tried to physically prevent the debate from taking place. In rare heated scenes, jostling members of the upper house surrounded the chairman of the security committee, Yoshitada Konoike, as he opened the debate on Wednesday and again on Thursday morning as the vote was taking place. The opposition had also tabled a no-confidence vote against Mr Konoike. Wednesday night's session was abandoned in the early hours of Thursday after opposition lawmakers blocked entry to a room where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other ministers were waiting to discuss the bill. Delaying tactics The bill has already been approved by the government-dominated lower house. It is expected to be passed in the upper house because the ruling coalition has a majority there - this was why opponents were keen to prevent the committee from approving the legislation. It is thought Mr Abe's government wants to pass the bills before the country goes into a five-day holiday on Saturday, which could provide an opportunity for even bigger protests. If the upper house does not pass the bills within 60 days, they will have to be returned the lower house. It is a step Mr Abe is thought to be willing to take. His Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc has a two-thirds majority in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Despite his majorities in both houses, the controversial bills, and Mr Abe's determination to push them through despite vocal opposition, appear to have damaged his popularity. Polls have consistently shown a majority of the public are opposed to the changes, and relatively few strongly support them. What is collective self-defence? Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. Mr Abe's government has pushed for security legislation that would allow Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? The government says Japan needs to pass the bills, which are welcomed by the US, to ensure regional peace and security in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness. It also says they will allow the country to participate more widely in global peacekeeping missions. But opponents say the legislation violates Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, and could lead to it being dragged into US-led conflicts. Despite the likelihood of eventual defeat, opposition to the bills has been credited with helping reverse decades of youth disengagement from politics in Japan. Students in particular, have been closely involved in leading protests once dominated by trade unionists and greying left-wing activists.","A controversial bill to expand the role of Japan's armed forces has cleared another hurdle in parliament, but sparked scuffles among lawmakers."

"The court heard he lied about his efforts to learn more about when WikiLeaks would publish damaging emails about Hillary Clinton in 2016. The jury returned its verdict on day two of deliberations in Washington DC. Witness tampering carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. The other counts can carry five years each. The court heard Stone lied in September 2017 during his testimony to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee's inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the US elections a year earlier. He was asked about WikiLeaks' release of damaging emails about Mrs Clinton - President Donald Trump's Democratic rival in the vote. How have people reacted? After Friday's verdict Mr Trump claimed that Stone had been the victim of ""a double standard"", arguing that the likes of Mrs Clinton and former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs he has sparred with had also told lies. But John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman whose emails were hacked, gloated over Stone's conviction. US intelligence officials and Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller later concluded those messages had been stolen by Russian hackers. What did Stone do? Stone is the sixth Trump aide or adviser convicted in a criminal case resulting from Mr Mueller's since-concluded investigation. The trial heard Stone had told five lies under oath, including about his conversations with Trump campaign officials and a supposed ""intermediary"" with WikiLeaks in early August 2016. He also lied about the existence of certain texts or emails. Prosecutors told the court that Stone had made the false statements to protect Mr Trump's image. Stone maintained the case against him was politically motivated. Embarrassing for all? Roger Stone, who served as an informal political adviser to Mr Trump for decades, was convicted of lying to Congress, among other offences. But it wasn't so much the fact that he lied, as it was what he lied about that could be politically damaging to Donald Trump. Federal prosecutors presented evidence during the trial that the 2016 Trump campaign viewed Stone as a conduit through which it could learn about the hacked Democratic documents that WikiLeaks possessed and when that material might be released. According to testimony by Rick Gates, deputy chairman of Trump's presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump had a telephone conversation with Stone discussing WikiLeaks. The president has said under oath that he did not recall any such conversations. His team has also disavowed any connection or coordination with WikiLeaks, which US intelligence agencies have concluded was being used by Russia to distribute the hacked Democratic material. Stone, prosecutors said, knew that if he truthfully testified about his efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks and pass information along to the campaign, it would at the very least be embarrassing for all involved. That, they concluded, is why he lied. Now that information is out anyway. And Roger Stone is facing years of incarceration. Stone had also tipped off the Trump campaign about new batches of damaging emails. He told Congress his intermediary with WikiLeaks was New York radio host and comedian Randy Credico, who interviewed Assange in 2016 - but prosecutors said Stone's actual go-between with WikiLeaks was a conservative author, Jerome Corsi. When Credico later testified to US lawmakers, he said Stone had advised him to ""do a 'Frank Pentangeli'"" - referring to a character in the Godfather movies who lies to Congress. Stone also threatened Credico's therapy dog, Bianca, saying he was ""going to take that dog away from you"", the trial heard. Meanwhile, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon also testified against Stone during the trial - telling the court he had boasted about his links to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. What happened in court? Stone appeared not to react to the verdict, ignoring a command to stand as it was being read out. As the jury reaffirmed their votes, he put his glasses back on to watch them. Former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo also refused to stand as the jury was leaving, despite being ordered to by a security officer. He was promptly removed from the courtroom. Prosecutors alleged that Stone communicated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones about the case on Thursday night, breaking a gag order. When Judge Jackson asked if this was true, Stone denied it - audibly telling his lawyers, ""it's not"" - but the judge added that she had ""serious concerns"", both about the gag order and about the ""nature"" of some of the people at the hearing. Among the media figures present at court were Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-right group Proud Boys, and Milo Yiannopolous. As Stone left the hearing, he told reporters who asked for comment that he had ""none whatsoever"", before posing for photos.","US President Donald Trump's adviser Roger Stone has been convicted on seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering."
"Andrew McCabe, who had just become the agency's acting chief after the surprise dismissal last year, said that he did not vote in the 2016 election. FBI special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Mr Comey's firing was an attempt to obstruct justice. Mr Mueller leads the probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. During Mr McCabe's introductory meeting with the president after he took over the federal law enforcement agency, Mr Trump also allegedly expressed anger with Mr McCabe over his wife's ties to the Clinton family. Mr McCabe reportedly found the conversation ""disturbing"", according to the Washington Post. Jill McCabe, a failed Democratic candidate for the Virginia state senate, had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from a political action committee controlled by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally. Last July, Mr Trump told the New York Times: ""We have a director of the FBI, acting, who received $700,000, whose wife received $700,000 from, essentially, Hillary Clinton."" He also erroneously claimed in a subsequent tweet that Mr McCabe had led the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email during her time as US secretary of state. Mr McCabe had recused himself from any investigations involving Virginia political figures, but Republicans have questioned why he was allowed to be involved in the investigations into Mrs Clinton's emails, claiming he has a conflict of interest. The FBI has said that Mrs McCabe's campaign had ended months before Mr McCabe became involved in that investigation, which he later recused himself from as the date of the presidential election neared. All about loyalty Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington For Donald Trump, it all comes down to loyalty. He asked James Comey if he was on his side - and the then-FBI director demurred. After sacking Mr Comey, the president's attention turned to his deputy's allegiances. While the head of the Republican National Committee may say this was just casual ""conversation"", Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe didn't think so at the time. A president inquiring about the voting habits of members of law enforcement, who should be insulated from political concerns, crosses a fairly bright line in US politics. Mr Trump has shown little regard for time-honoured political norms and traditions, of course. It was part of his appeal for many voters. The president may not have even known such questions are considered out of bounds. These kinds of inquiries risk giving the appearance of political influence in the administration of justice, however. And if a law enforcement agency is actively investigating possible malfeasance involving the president or his associates, they could be evidence of criminal obstruction. With special counsel Robert Mueller already reportedly sniffing around the matter, that should be cause for White House concern. The fresh revelations come a day after US media reported that Christopher Wray, who formally replaced Mr Comey as FBI Director last August, had threatened to quit after coming under pressure from his superiors to fire Mr McCabe. Mr Trump on Tuesday denied that Mr Wray had threatened to resign over Mr McCabe. Mr Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling has continued to dog Mr Trump, as his presidency enters a second year. Exactly one year ago on Wednesday, Mr Trump's newly sworn-in national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was allegedly interviewed by FBI agents at the White House, NBC News reported. That meeting, which Mr Flynn failed to notify his lawyers or other administration officials about, was held to discuss Mr Flynn's meetings with a Russian ambassador. Only 24 days after taking the job, Mr Flynn was fired for lying about the Russia meeting to Vice-President Mike Pence, the White House said. During Mr Comey's dinner meeting with Mr Trump before he was fired in May, he claims that the president had asked him to drop the investigation, which included Mr Flynn's communications with Russian officials. ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,"" Mr Trump told Mr Comey, according to the former FBI chief's testimony. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Director of the National Security Agency Mike Rogers, former Acting-Attorney General Sally Yates, and James Comey have all reportedly been interviewed by Mr Mueller's team, according to NBC.","After firing James Comey as director of the FBI, US President Donald Trump asked the agency's deputy director whom he had voted for, US media report."

"By Adam EastonBBC News, Warsaw How Poles and Jews behaved toward each other during 1939-1945 is still being evaluated and remains highly provocative here. This was clearly seen last November with the premiere of the movie Poklosie (""Aftermath""), a fictional thriller that told the story of a Polish man who returns to his hometown and discovers a dark secret about its past. During the war, at the instigation of the Nazis, local people, including his own father, rounded up the town's Jews, locked them in a building and set it on fire. In the last 10 years or so it has become widely known that massacres like this actually happened in several Polish towns, most notably in Jedwabne, north-eastern Poland, where Poles at the instigation of the Nazis murdered more than 300 Jews. Some right-wing critics and politicians branded the movie ""anti-Polish"", arguing that it paints a false picture of Poles as collaborators with Nazi Germany. The history of Polish-Jewish relations is also controversial because there is a perception among some Poles that Jews in the eastern part of the country welcomed the Red Army and collaborated with the Soviet occupation forces. 'Incredible discussion' The film's lead actor, Maciej Stuhr, was called a ""Polish traitor"", a ""Jew"" and ""Adolf Hitler"" on Internet forums. Its producer, Dariusz Jablonski, said he made the movie because he believes film is a good platform to raise this issue, especially with younger people. ""During communist times we were told that Poles were always the noble knights of the Second World War. We were either victims or we fought against the Nazi occupation and were saving Jews. ""As in the life of any family, society or nation there are black holes along with the positive stories. This was our black hole. The discussion the film caused revealed how much still needs to be done,"" Mr Jablonski told me. Poland did indeed suffer horribly from not one but two brutal occupations, Nazi and Soviet, during the war. More than five million of its citizens, three million of them Jews, were killed. About as many Poles were killed in the bombing of Warsaw in 1939 as Germans killed in the bombing of Dresden in 1945. Added to this is the fact that many more Poles are honoured by Israel for saving the lives of Jews during the war than any other nation. After communism collapsed in 1989, academics were free to research the brutal reality of this war-time period, when the occupying Nazis induced Poles to give up Jews and forbade them to help their Jewish neighbours on pain of death. The debate was blown open in 2001 with the publication of the book Neighbours by Polish emigre professor Jan Gross, which discussed Jedwabne. ""It unleashed an incredible national discussion. It went on for about a year. Almost every day there was something in the newspapers, journals, magazines, radio and TV. ""Ten years earlier Poles discovered that something horrible happened to Jews and 10 years later they said, 'Wait a second, you know, some of our own people helped',"" Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, remembers. ""Under the communists one of the mantras was 'We Poles suffered under the Nazis', and now all of a sudden they're being told, yes you were persecuted but some of you were not only victims, some of you were even collaborators. ""That entails a change of a national image, which is very hard, and I have tremendous respect for Poles who were able to say we are not as perfect as we thought. For a country to do that is simply inspiring. There are still Poles today that don't want to admit it and that's a black stain on the soul of Poland,"" he added. Jewish history Staff at the new Museum of the History of Polish Jews, built on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto, expect its portrayal of this period to be the most controversial. The museum, which took almost 20 years to get off the ground and will cost around $100m (£65m) once complete, will open its doors on the anniversary of the uprising for educational and cultural workshops. The core exhibition is expected to open early next year. The museum will seek to educate and inform people about the long and rich history of Jewish life in Poland. Jews first came to the country in the Middle Ages and settled in large numbers because of the relatively tolerant attitude towards them. It became the largest Jewish community in the world. Ninety per cent of that community was wiped out in the Holocaust and today, there are only about 40-50,000 people with Jewish roots living in Poland. ""In Poland now the real issue is the lack of knowledge about Jewish life and what its importance is for Poles. Jews were living here for 1,000 years and as a result we have Hebrew and Yiddish words in the Polish language, Polish cuisine is filled with Jewish dishes. ""Children in every kindergarten learn poems written by Jewish poets. People drive Citroen cars without knowing it was a company established by Polish Jews. We are grateful to Polish Jews who emigrated to the US and created Hollywood. When we tell people this they open their eyes wide,"" museum spokesman Piotr Kossobudzki said. Of course, anti-Semitic attitudes persist in Poland as they do in most European countries. But in the last 20 years, thanks to the late Polish pope, John Paul II, calling anti-Semitism a sin, progress has been made. Jewish history and culture have also become increasingly popular among Poles. The country now has major Jewish cultural festivals and demand for Yiddish and Hebrew language classes has risen. Poles are also helping the existing Jewish community to preserve its cemeteries. Earlier this week, around 100 volunteers took part in cleaning up Warsaw's Jewish cemetery. ""It's a shame. We used to have such a huge community of Jewish people here in Poland. There are lots of monuments, cemeteries and places connected to them, so it would be good if Polish people could do something to look after them,"" 28-year-old volunteer Katarzyna Regulska said.","Poland is marking the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising on Friday, one of the most remarkable acts of resistance in World War II, a period when the almost 1,000-year-old history of Polish-Jewish relations underwent its most severe test."
"The Aga Khan University Hospital said it would do all it could to help and encouraged others to do the same. The breakdown of the machine in Uganda has left thousands at risk of missing potential life-saving treatment. Uganda's government has said it will cover the travel and other costs for the 400 going to the Nairobi hospital. The private, not-for-profit hospital in the Kenyan capital has two radiotherapy units and six radiation oncologists. Radiotherapy treatment can be expensive - and most patients in Uganda are unable to afford to pay for the treatment. ""We are committed to working with the government of Uganda to help save the lives of cancer patients in need of treatment while it works to re-establish its radiation therapy capacity,"" Aga Khan University Hospital's CEO Shawn Bolouk said in a statement. ""Our values as an institution dictate nothing less. While we can only treat a small fraction of those requiring care, given our resources and the tremendous need that exists, we will do all we can to help, and we encourage others to follow our lead."" Details of how to transport the patients were being worked out by the relevant authorities, the hospital statement added. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Uganda's capital, Kampala, says the Ugandan government has also agreed to pay for the 400 patients' accommodation and food as well as for those of a relative or friend if an attendant is needed. The government says it has purchased a new radiotherapy machine and it should be up and running in six months, once a special bunker has been built to house the radioactive equipment at Mulago Hospital in Kampala. Other treatments are still available in Uganda, but the cancer institute at Mulago Hospital says that three-quarters of the 44,000 new cancer patients in Uganda last year needed radiotherapy. Patients from Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan are also referred to Mulago Hospital for radiotherapy. The treatment uses radiation to target and kill cancerous cells in a specific part of the body, and can be used for many types of cancer. The incidence of cancer is on the rise in Africa overall as life expectancy increases.",A Kenyan hospital is to provide free cancer treatment to 400 patients from Uganda as the neighbouring country's only radiotherapy machine has broken.
"Engelbart developed the tool in the 1960s as a wooden shell covering two metal wheels, patenting it long before the mouse's widespread use. He also worked on early incarnations of email, word processing and video teleconferences at a California research institute. The state's Computer History Museum was notified of his death by his daughter, Christina, in an email. Her father had been in poor health and died peacefully on Tuesday night in his sleep, she said. Doug Engelbart was born on 30 January 1925 in Portland, Oregon, to a radio repairman father and a housewife mother. 'Mother of all demos' He studied electrical engineering at Oregon State University and served as a radar technician during World War II. He then worked at Nasa's predecessor, Naca, as an electrical engineer, but soon left to pursue a doctorate at University of California, Berkeley. His interest in how computers could be used to aid human cognition eventually led him to Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and then his own laboratory, the Augmentation Research Center. His laboratory helped develop ARPANet, the government research network that led to the internet. Engelbart's ideas were way ahead of their time in an era when computers took up entire rooms and data was fed into the hulking machines on punch cards. At a now legendary presentation that became known as the ""mother of all demos"" in San Francisco in 1968, he made the first public demonstration of the mouse. At the same event, he held the first video teleconference and explained his theory of text-based links, which would form the architecture of the internet. He did not make much money from the mouse because its patent ran out in 1987, before the device became widely used. SRI licensed the technology in 1983 for $40,000 (£26,000) to Apple. At least one billion computer mice have been sold. Engelbart had considered other designs for his most famous invention, including a device that could be fixed underneath a table and operated by the knee. He was said to have been driven by the belief that computers could be used to augment human intellect. Engelbart was awarded the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT prize in 1997 and the National Medal of Technology for ""creating the foundations of personal computing"" in 2000. Since 2005, he had been a fellow at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. He is survived by his second wife, Karen O'Leary Engelbart, and four children.","The inventor of the computer mouse, Doug Engelbart, has died aged 88."
"An overwhelming majority of MPs voted to change the Marriage Act, eight days after a similarly decisive result in the Senate. The vote set off immediate celebrations in parliament, prompting cheers, applause and even a song. The result brings an end to more than a decade of robust and often bitter debate on the issue. ""What a day for love, for equality, for respect,"" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. ""Australia has done it."" The legislation sailed through parliament without amendments after Australians overwhelmingly supported the reform in a voluntary national poll. Australia's governor-general is expected to approve the bill in the coming days, marking its official passage into law. Emotional MPs hugged each other before supporters in the public gallery began singing ""I am, you are, we are Australian"". Earlier, many supporters had gathered on the lawn outside parliament. They included prominent same-sex marriage advocates, including former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe and local comedian Magda Szubanski. More than 100 MPs had spoken on the legislation after it was tabled in the House of Representatives. Many senators and MPs related personal stories in explaining why they supported the bill. One MP's speech ended with a marriage proposal - a first for the lower house. However, other politicians expressed their opposition. ""It is a special relationship between man and a woman for the purposes, if you are so lucky, for bringing children into the world,"" Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Thursday. Keeping up with opinion Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent This is a big moment for Australian politics - the culmination of more than a decade of debate and indecision. For a long time the issue of same-sex marriage was seen as too difficult and too divisive, and so it was hit into the long grass. Campaigners watched with frustration as other countries, not least neighbouring New Zealand, made gay marriage legal. There was a feeling, confirmed by the results of the postal survey, that Australia's lawmakers had failed to keep up with public opinion. Today's vote won't end the debate, or silence opponents of same-sex marriage - but it does mark the beginning of a new chapter. The bill to amend the Marriage Act was first introduced in the Senate last month, immediately after a national poll showed 61.6% of Australians favoured change. The bill includes exemptions for registered religious celebrants, who can refuse to marry same-sex couples on the basis of their faith. Some conservative politicians had sought to extend exemptions to others, such as non-religious celebrants and businesses, but those proposals failed. When will the first weddings happen? The bill will require royal assent from Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, in what is considered a formality. Same-sex couples will then be allowed to register to marry. Like heterosexual couples, they must wait 30 days after registration before a ceremony can take place. Couples who wed overseas, or have already done so, will automatically have their marriages recognised in Australia. Did the debate cause controversy? Yes. The national vote, a voluntary postal survey, followed two failed attempts by the government to hold a compulsory poll that was twice voted down by the Senate. Senators who opposed the compulsory vote did not necessarily oppose legalisation, but said the vote would be costly and fuel hate campaigns. They argued the matter should be put to a parliamentary vote. Many same-sex marriage advocates levelled the same criticism at the voluntary vote, which did not require legislative approval. During the eight-week survey, both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage were accused of bullying and conducting misleading campaigns. The controversy included frequent claims of vilification, while former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd blamed the survey for an assault on his godson. More than 12.7 million people - about 79.5% of eligible voters - took part in the vote. It prompted jubilant scenes when the result was made public last month.",Same-sex marriage will become legal in Australia after a historic bill was passed in the House of Representatives.
"The PM met the pontiff at the Vatican on Monday as part of his trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The residential schools were set up from the 1880s to take children from their families and assimilate them into mainstream Canadian society. The last one closed in 1996. ""I told him how important it is for Canadians to move forward on real reconciliation with the indigenous peoples and I highlighted how he could help by issuing an apology,"" Mr Trudeau told reporters after meeting the pope. He said he had invited the pontiff to make the apology in Canada. Some 150,000 aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families, and sent to live in church-run boarding schools where they were forbidden to speak their language or practise their own culture. Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called for a papal apology, as part of the healing process for survivors. Although the Vatican has not commented on Mr Trudeau's request, it confirmed the talk was ""cordial"" and lasted about 36 minutes. It said the conversation ""focused on the themes of integration and reconciliation, as well as religious freedom and current ethical issues"" but did not mention an apology directly. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has been tasked with collecting the stories of survivors and recommending a way forward for the country to heal, has called the residential school system ""cultural genocide"". In its report, the commission recommended the Catholic Church issue a formal apology for its part in the residential school system. Similar apologies have been issued by Anglican, Presbyterian and United Churches, who along with the Catholic Church helped run these schools as joint ventures with the Canadian government. In 2008, former prime minister Stephen Harper issued an apology on behalf of Canadians, calling it ""a sad chapter in our history"". A year later, Pope Benedict expressed ""his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church"" to a delegation from the Assembly of First Nations, a national advocacy organization, who went to the Vatican. In 2015, Mr Harper met Pope Francis and called attention to the commission's findings. Mr Trudeau said he also spoke with the Pope about a subject dear to both of them: the importance of stopping climate change. ""We talked about how important it is to highlight the scientific basis of protecting our planet and the moral and ethical obligations to lead, to build a better future for all people on this earth,"" Mr Trudeau said. During the visit to the Vatican, Mr Trudeau was joined by his wife Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau. While in Italy, he also visited the Roma football club and will meet Italy's prime minister and president.",Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asked Pope Francis to apologise for the role of the Catholic Church in a Canadian school system where indigenous children were abused for decades.

A spokeswoman said the scans would provide evidence of current condition and could also be used for future education and research. They will be available online by 2019. The crosses and carved stones, which are situated across the island, range from simple grave-markers to intricately inscribed monuments. Some were carved with letters of the Ogham, Latin and Runic alphabets, while others include personal and place names and scenes from Christian and Norse mythology. The MNH spokeswoman said the laser scanning technology being used would capture the crosses to a ""resolution of one tenth of a millimetre"".",More than 200 Manx medieval stone crosses are being scanned to create an archive which will help with their future preservation.
"Soldiers and army vehicles are on the streets of the capital, Harare, where gunfire and artillery were heard on Wednesday. Is it a coup? The military insists not - but it certainly has a lot of the hallmarks. The signs that a coup is under way have always been the same across the world and across the decades. Here are the key things to watch out for when a takeover is on the cards. 1. Nobody ever says it's a coup Firstly, be aware that almost nobody mounting a coup ever says that's what they're doing. Zimbabwe's envoy to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, explicitly said there was no coup as the government was ""intact"" with no ""military takeover"". ""We are only targeting criminals around [President Mugabe] who are... causing social and economic suffering,"" Mr Moyo said on state TV. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy."" The ""situation"" probably looks more alarming to those on the wrong side of the military action, however. This kind of semantic wriggling is common in attempted coups. In restive Venezuela, which has seen violent anti-government protests since the spring, military officers launched an unsuccessful uprising against President Nicolas Maduro in August. ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the group's leader, Juan Caguaripano. Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party disagreed, and deputy leader Diosdado Cabello branded it a ""terrorist attack"" on Twitter. 2. Where's the head of state? When checking for a likely coup, look at where the head of state is. President Mugabe is being held in Harare under house arrest, according to the office of South Africa's President Jacob Zuma. He reportedly said in a phone call that he was fine. There is no confirmation of the fate of his powerful wife, 52-year-old Grace Mugabe, who has been vying to be her husband's successor. However, an MP from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, Eddie Cross, told the BBC she had fled Zimbabwe for Namibia on Tuesday night. Detaining the target of the uprising is a vital stage in proceedings. As the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus observes, the failure of Turkey's attempted coup in July 2016 stemmed from the plotters' inability to immobilise President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Foreign embassies can become a place of refuge for ousted or imperilled leaders. When President George Bush Senior invaded Panama in 1989, repressive strongman General Manuel Noriega holed himself up in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City. And sometimes, the head of state will show up in an entirely different country. In Honduras in 2009, troops deposed President Manuel Zelaya and forced him onto a plane. When he arrived in Costa Rica, he said he had been kidnapped in his pyjamas. Almost three months later he made a surprise return - and installed himself in Honduras's Brazilian embassy. 3. People (and gunfire) on the streets Waves of popular protest are a key coup signifier. Protesters will often call for a return to democracy and the fall of a repressive regime, only for the military to move in and take power. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak was forced out by mass protests during the Arab Spring of 2010-11, which also swept across Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Syria. The turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the demonstrating crowds. Mr Mubarak stood down, and a military administration stepped into the breach. As Turkey's failed coup unfolded in July 2016, civilians actually took to the streets in support of the threatened president. When bridges over the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul were blocked by renegade troops, the public joined pro-Erdogan soldiers to confront them. There has been a lack of public protest in Zimbabwe, where tensions were triggered by Mr Mugabe sacking his political deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in favour of his wife, Grace. The streets are said to be calm, but armoured military vehicles are patrolling the capital. 4. Foreign powers warn their nationals Even if not sheltering an endangered leader, embassies on the ground have a duty to keep their nationals safe, so they'll start offering guidance. In Zimbabwe, the UK Foreign Office has advised Britons ""currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accommodation until the situation becomes clearer"". The US embassy tweeted that it would be closed on Wednesday ""due to ongoing uncertainty"". 5. State media seized Getting the message out is important, so rebels often try to seize state or private media to use as their mouthpiece. In Zimbabwe, the military has successfully overrun the headquarters of the state TV station, ZBC. Taking to the airwaves is no guarantee of success, however. In Turkey in 2016, the doomed army faction used a state broadcaster to claim it had seized power to protect democracy from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In fact, the revolt was suppressed. Zambia in 1997 saw an even less successful effort, with an attempted coup that lasted just three hours. At six o'clock one morning, a man calling himself Captain Solo announced on state radio that he had taken over the country, that the heads of the army and police were dismissed, and that President Frederick Chiluba had until nine to surrender or be killed. The president swiftly went on air to say six people had been arrested, and thanked his troops for ""a job well done"". 6. Borders, bridges and airports close To impose control over a country - or even just its capital city - it helps to close the borders, and seal bridges and other infrastructure that allow people in and out. In September 2015, presidential guards who led a coup in Burkina Faso ordered the sealing of land and air borders, as well as a night-time curfew. Perhaps the most striking lesson in airport control comes from Pakistan in 1999, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to sack powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, and a battle for supremacy began. Gen Musharraf was in Sri Lanka when he got word that Mr Sharif planned to move against him, and made an airborne dash from Colombo airport to Karachi. Air traffic control refused permission for the plane and its 200 passengers to land, and the pilot was ordered to divert it, first to Oman, then to India. The general ordered the pilot to keep circling Karachi, even though fuel was running dangerously low. The plane was only brought down safely when pro-Musharraf soldiers surrounded the airport's control tower. The general was whisked to safety, and claimed control of Pakistan hours later.","Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been detained by the country's military, who have seized control of the national broadcaster, ZBC."
"The foreign affairs ministry said Yirenping had ""violated the law"" but gave no further details. The group has been locked out of its Beijing office after the police conducted a raid last month. China earlier this week freed the women after more than a month in detention, a move welcomed by rights groups. The detention of the women, who planned protests against sexual harassment, had sparked an international outcry. In a daily press briefing on Tuesday, the foreign affairs ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the activists were from Yirenping and that the organisation ""will be punished for violating the law"". The details of the allegations and the punishment threatened were not given. Yirenping's co-founder Lu Jun told the BBC's Beijing bureau that he was looking for lawyers to address the allegations, adding: ""We believe we have done everything legally."" Mr Lu, who is currently based in New York, said that police officers had broken down the door of their Beijing office in the early hours of 24 March to conduct their raid. ""My colleagues can't get into the office any more because the lock has been changed. I have pushed for an answer about who did this. The local police did not admit to it but said higher authority did it,"" he said. Also known as the Beijing Yirenping Centre, the group has offices in Beijing as well as Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. It was founded in 2006 to ""promote public health, eliminate discrimination, and defend the right of disadvantaged groups through legal means"", according to its website. It focuses on helping those with HIV and hepatitis B, women and disabled people bring anti-discrimination lawsuits against the government, companies and schools. It had lobbied for the release of the women, who were arrested shortly before International Women's Day on 8 March. Mr Lu had earlier said their detention was ""a glaring injustice"". The women had planned activities including a march in a Beijing park where participants would wear stickers advocating safe sex, and gatherings in Beijing and Guangzhou calling for awareness of sexual harassment on buses. The US, UK and European Union had all called for them to be freed. The five have not been charged but their bail conditions mean charges could be brought at a later date. Their lawyer also said they would need to update the authorities on their whereabouts. Rights groups said that their release showed that international pressure had worked, and called on China to drop all restrictions and threat of charges.",China has threatened to punish a local human rights group linked to five women's activists who were released on Tuesday.
"Deputy Mike Higgins wants the limit reduced and said it would make the road safer. The inner road, running between Lower Park and Mont Felard, is one of the island's busiest roads with more than 14,000 drivers using it daily. Along the road is a primary school, hundreds of homes, churches, a park and shops. Deputy Higgins said there were too few designated crossing points. He said part of the road was very narrow, with a number of ""choke points"", where crashes have happened in the past. Deputy Higgins believes many drivers regularly break the existing 30mph limit. He hopes making the inner road a 25mph zone will make it safer, and encourage more drivers to use Victoria Avenue.",The St Aubin inner road in Jersey could have a speed limit of 25mph in future.
"They are accused of using business email fraud schemes and romance scams to con victims - many of them elderly. Police have so far arrested 14 suspects across the US, 11 in Los Angeles alone. Others are thought to be in Nigeria and authorities there say they will cooperate with US. Prosecutors say it is one of the ""largest cases of its kind in US history"". The FBI investigation is a major step to disrupt criminal networks, US Attorney Nick Hanna said. ""This case is part of our ongoing efforts to protect Americans from fraudulent online schemes and to bring to justice those who prey upon American citizens and businesses,"" he added. The FBI started investigating the case in 2016 in a single bank account but it later extended to cover multiple victims in the US and around the world. All the 80 defendants have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft, the US Attorney's Office in the Central District of California said in a press release. Many suspects abroad Two Nigerian nationals, identified as Valentine Iro and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe, who are part of those arrested in the US, have been named as co-conspirators working with others in the US and in Nigeria, to obtain money from victims and then transfer it abroad. They managed to fraudulently obtain $6m (£5m) in a conspiracy aimed at stealing $46m, the US Attorney's Office alleges. The remaining 66 defendants are believed to be abroad, ""with most them located in Nigeria"", the authorities say. Those named should be handed to the US to face a trial, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, who heads the Nigerian government's diaspora commission said in a statement. ""We... ask those accused in Nigeria to voluntarily turn themselves in to American authorities to clear their names, without which the Nigerian government should extradite them if relevant international treaties between the two governments are invoked."" The actions of a few should not tarnish all Nigerians, she added. Fake US soldier The suspects used illicit money exchangers to move money to Nigeria, generally avoiding transferring the funds directly through banking institutions, the indictment says. The authorities have listed a total of 252 charges against the 80 suspects. One of the victims, a Japanese woman named FK in court papers, was conned out of $200,000 after being contacted by a fraudster identifying themselves as US Capt Terry Garcia who wanted to smuggle diamonds out of Syria. She made 35 to 40 payments, receiving as many as 10 to 15 emails a day directing her to send money to accounts in the US, Turkey and the United Kingdom through the captain's many purported associates, the LA Times reports.","The US authorities have charged 80 people, ""most of whom are Nigerian nationals"", with participating in a conspiracy to steal millions of dollars, prosecutors say."
"Although prostitution is legal in France, soliciting in public and pimping are not. The National Assembly voted 16 months ago to impose a €1,500 (£1,090; $1,600) fine on clients, shifting the criminal burden from prostitutes. The upper house's decision to scrap the fine will now go back to the assembly. Social affairs minister Marisol Touraine said that Monday night's vote was ""absolutely unbelievable and contemptuous towards women"". But Joelle Garriaud-Maylam, a conservative senator, argued that the offence of soliciting was a useful resource for the authorities. ""To help these women, you first of all have to identify them."" 'No choice' The initial move to shift penalties from prostitutes to their clients followed a Swedish law that made it a crime to buy sex but not to sell it. Supporters argued that the move would help tackle trafficking networks. A Swedish government-commissioned report suggested that the 1999 law had brought about a dramatic fall in the numbers of women working as prostitutes. But the effect of the law is not entirely clear as many prostitutes have moved off the streets and on to the internet. France has an estimated 30,000 sex workers and the interior ministry says most come from eastern Europe, Africa, China and South America. Socialists who backed France's 2013 bill to criminalise paying for sex, rather than soliciting for it, had initially hoped that the trial of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn might influence the conservative-dominated Senate. Maud Olivier, a Socialist MP, said the trial had shone a light on the truth behind the world of escorts. ""There is no choice; violence is ever present,"" she told Le Monde newspaper. The trial was bruising for Mr Strauss-Kahn, who endured a torrid time facing accusations of aggravated pimping, as several women gave evidence against him before dropping their case. He denied knowing the women were prostitutes. The verdict is expected in June.","France's Senate has rejected a planned 2013 law penalising people who pay for sex, and has chosen to maintain the offence of soliciting."
"But to Chinese officials, the exiled spiritual leader is a traitor. The role of Dalai Lama has been filled for centuries through ""reincarnation"". The current Dalai Lama, the 14th, turns 80 this year, and Beijing is keen to control the process of finding the 15th. But the present Dalai Lama has said the role will one day end. Better to have no Dalai Lama than ""a stupid one"". So, will he reincarnate? The BBC World Service's The Inquiry programme hears from four expert witnesses. Chonpel Tsering: Reincarnation process must not be manipulated Chonpel Tsering is the Dalai Lama's representative in northern Europe. ""I genuinely don't know [whether he will reincarnate]. Tibetan Buddhism believes that everybody is reborn, but not everybody can choose how and when they are reborn. ""The lamas - the senior religious figures - are able to determine firstly whether they are reborn, and if they are going to be reborn, where they'll be reborn. ""The present carnation, the present Dalai Lama, can decide. The rebirth is his choice. ""First, he is going to consult the Tibetan people and others that follow Tibetan Buddhism to find out whether they think that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama. ""If the decision is, 'Yes,' then he will set out clear instructions about the process, so that there is no ambiguity, so that the reincarnation process isn't manipulated or misused by anybody for their own personal or political interests. ""The Chinese and the Communist Party have set up systems where reincarnations such as his holiness the Dalai Lama have to be recognised and approved by the Communist Party. ""Maybe [they] feel that if they pick their own 15th Dalai Lama, somehow that authority will transfer on to the [one] lama they have picked. ""His holiness has said that the 15th would be born outside of Tibet, outside of China, because this 15th Dalai Lama would have to continue the work of the present Dalai Lama. ""If there is no genuine religious freedom inside Tibet, then it's very hard for him to continue that work."" Jia Xiudong: Dalai Lama is playing a political game Jia Xiudong is senior research fellow at the China Institute of international studies in Beijing. ""I believe that the tradition will be maintained [and] the Dalai Lama will be reincarnated. ""There's a role for the current Dalai Lama to play for the reincarnation, but I believe he should not exaggerate that role. ""For example, he just cannot stop the tradition individually. ""It is tradition passed from centuries ago. ""The sovereign issue is the number one issue behind all the differences and dispute. ""So, it's not actually China's argument with the Dalai Lama. ""It's not about the freedom of religion. ""It is about sovereignty - whether Tibet can remain part of China. ""When he talks about reincarnation, many people in China believe that the Dalai Lama is playing a political game. ""The 14th Dalai Lama and those people around him who call for the independence of Tibet, they have made the issue of reincarnation, in a way, a political issue. ""He doesn't use the word 'independence', he says the 'highest autonomy', but to the ears of people here in China, when they look at the specific demands by the Dalai Lama, people believe that actually behind all those words of 'highest autonomy' it actually means 'independence'. So that is the problem. ""The government is concerned by the stability in Tibet because we believe that our experiences have shown that without stability you just cannot enjoy economic development, improvement of life. ""If the [reincarnation] tradition is followed, and then people see this tradition is still there, I think it will contribute to stability in Tibet."" Robert Barnett: China wants a 'tame' lama Robert Barnett is director of the Modern Tibet Studies Programme at Columbia University in New York. ""Traditionally, at least in the last couple of hundred years, there was a role for both sides in this process. ""What's happening now in China is instead of just confirming the decision made by lamas about which child is a reincarnation, now the Communist Party is effectively saying it wants to decide whether a lama reincarnates at all, and even sometimes which child gets chosen. So this is a kind of mission creep for the state."" In 1995, the Dalai Lama named a six-year-old boy as the reincarnation of the second most important leader in Tibetan Buddhism, the Panchen Lama. But he was hidden away by the Chinese authorities and replaced by a boy of their choosing. ""They forced Tibetans to worship a certain child as the 11th Panchen Lama, when it's almost certain that no Tibetans actually believe that child is the 11th Panchen Lama. ""This is one of the most fascinating issues in the whole story: nobody in the Communist Party seems to have ever considered the possibility that they could rule Tibetans without a lama to be their intermediary. ""[It] seems to come out of an unquestioning idea that because Tibetans are often religious, they're therefore not susceptible to rational arguments about how wonderful Communism is and you have to persuade them through religion. ""So they have invested huge resources into trying to find a tame lama. ""They make films about the lama who supported the party in the 1930s, they made a TV series about another lama who supported the Communist Party and then they tried to develop these children who would become their supporters. ""Every time they've tried to do that it's failed. The children, when they grow up and become adults, either they flee to India to join the Dalai Lama or else they've turned into critics of the Communist Party from within the system. ""I think we have to look at all of this as negotiating moves on both sides. So the Dalai Lama is making these speculative, philosophical statements about, 'I might be coming back, I might not. I might come back as a woman.' ""This is his normal method as a Buddhist teacher of the kind that he is to make people think. But it's also a negotiating move with the Chinese to expose them to the kind of ridicule that they've put themselves in now by claiming to be able to arbitrate on matters like religion and reincarnation. ""This Dalai Lama has been so effective as a religious leader, even more so than as a political leader, that there's going to be huge force among his followers for him to come back. So it's quite likely that it's going to happen."" Jamyang Norbu: Dalai Lama must reincarnate for the sake of Tibet's future Tibetan writer and activist Jamyang Norbu fell out of favour with the present Dalai Lama when he criticised his ""softly softly"" approach to China. ""He doesn't have much of a choice. The lama's reincarnating is a political institution. ""It'll have to be the choice of the Tibetan government in exile and of the people. ""China will have their candidate up and running, and you can be 100% sure that they will.

"By Jessica LussenhopBBC News, Henry County, Virginia If the sun is shining down on the verdant hills of Henry County, Virginia, chances are that Janice Merkel can be found on the side of the road somewhere, waving at the traffic from a lawn chair under a giant sign: ""TRUMP GEAR"". On a sweltering day in early July, she sits just feet from the traffic hurtling past in front of a motorcycle shop. Truckers blast their horns in approval as they thunder past. ""I've noticed a shift, I'm getting more honks and waves,"" says the 48-year-old mother of two. ""I'm actually disappointed I'm not getting flipped off."" Since she began selling six weeks ago, Merkel has become something of an unofficial pollster for the people who stop to peruse her selection of (unofficial) Trump T-shirts and hats emblazoned with slogans like, ""Build That Wall"" and ""Finally Someone With Balls"". ""The main viewpoint is they just don't want Hillary,"" she says. ""That is the biggest comment. We just have to get rid of Obama, we have to get rid of the Clintons. And they'll vote for Trump just to get rid of her."" The people of Henry County - hundreds of miles away from the increasingly Democratic-leaning parts of northern Virginia closer to Washington - have long memories. They remember the heyday of the local economy in the 1960s and '70s, when there were so many manufacturing jobs that you could quit one in the morning and have another by after lunch, as the local saying goes. But then came globalisation, the North American Free Trade Agreement - ratified by potential first husband, former President Bill Clinton - and the textile plants and the furniture factories packed up for Mexico or went belly up. Unemployment hit 20%. When the US was declared officially in a recession in 2008, Henry County residents grumbled that they'd already been in one for 10 years. Today, some locals would dearly love to stop bemoaning the job losses and the empty factories, which at this point have been shut so long an entire generation has grown up never knowing what it was like when the area was booming. But locals have yet to forgive the Clintons. ""No way I'd vote for Hillary Clinton,"" says Andy Turner, a cemetery owner who drops by Merkel's stand to buy two Trump yard signs. ""If she was running by herself it just wouldn't happen."" ""I'd vote for the devil before I'd vote for her,"" says Buddy, a white bearded veteran who rode up on a gleaming purple Harley Davidson. Merkel calls all her customers ""sweetie"" and sends them off with a promise to ""tell everyone"" that she's here. She is proud of her salesmanship, but admits she would prefer a full-time job with health insurance. The Trump job is by its nature temporary, and she has a chronic health condition that requires expensive medication. Although she voted for Obama the first time, she says he lost her support because of the Affordable Care Act. ""You're working close to minimum wage and yet you're still supposed to have insurance - how?"" she asks. ""I am one of the poorest of the poor."" When she arrived in the area 11 years ago, Merkel says she was fleeing an abusive marriage in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, with her two young sons in tow. She struggled to start over from nothing in an economically depressed area. Unable to find a job doing administrative work in an office, she worked at a tyre shop for roughly minimum wage. Despite all that, she is optimistic about her future, especially now that her two boys are grown and ""excelling"" at the local community college. When she talks about her hope that Trump can bring the country ""back"" she transitions almost seamlessly into her own personal story. ""I was just making ends meet, but I raised two really great kids,"" she says. ""I'm back to being what I used to be prior to my husband - that go-getter. That 'I'm not going to take anything from anybody' person again. ""It's great to be back. To have me back."" More on Clinton v Trump Eight years ago, when Merkel voted for Obama, he held a campaign event at an automotive warehouse in Martinsville, the seat of Henry County, and told the crowd, ""I will wake up in that White House thinking about the people of Martinsville and the people of Henry County, and how I can make your life better."" But eight years later, Merkel is still poor. She is still under-employed. For years, state and national politicians have used Martinsville as a backdrop to launch their campaigns promising new jobs. Their failure to deliver has left the residents numb and disillusioned. ""The average person who has been hurt the most by the way the global economy has changed hasn't seen a lot of change in Washington or a lot of benefit in their own personal lives,"" says Max Hall, a middle school teacher. ""Around here people blame Nafta, they blame the World Trade Organization - it's all different faces of the same trend which is globalisation and I think that's what's driving all of this."" This is the appeal of Trump, the non-politician, the businessman who promises to renegotiate our trade deals and reign in currency manipulation by countries like China. Indeed, in national polls, Trump was seen as the candidate who can better ""handle the economy"". Henry County rose to prominence thanks to small businessmen and Trump supporters would rather put the country in his untested hands rather than trust a lifelong politician whose husband played a direct role in the decline of their local economy. To Merkel and others like her, Trump's message is not about fear or isolationism. It's a message of hope. ""He's standing up for those who can't,"" she says. ""I really believe Trump can bring back some business to America, get people working again, give them a reason to get up in the morning. Take pride in themselves again, because they can get off the system, they can make it. They can do it."" On race days at the Martinsville Speedway, a paperclip-shaped Nascar track dubbed the ""half mile of mayhem"", the population of the area temporarily triples - the grounds behind the track fill up with camping tents and every hotel is booked. But on the 4 July, the track shuts down and a stage is erected on the finish line. Big name country music acts play before a huge fireworks display - this year the performer is the Gatlin Brothers. Outside the stadium, a miniature carnival springs up, with bounce houses and a small Ferris wheel. Everything is free, paid for by a pool of 40-50 local businesses. ""When we were growing up as kids, a family could still afford to maybe go to the beach or for a long weekend for Fourth of July,"" says Jeb Bassett, who fundraises for the event. ""[Twenty years ago,] the economy just wasn't what it had been. Families couldn't afford to take a vacation, so we wanted to continue the celebration."" This year, as the stands begin to fill, Martinsville Mayor Danny Turner is glad-handing near the stage when a man excitedly taps him on the shoulder, mistaking Turner's cap for one of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" hats. The man leans down toward a tiny boy at his knee - his great grandson - and asks who he's going to vote for. ""Trump!"" the boy squeaks. Turner chuckles. Mayor Turner is a gregarious retired United Parcel Service employee who has lived in Martinsville all his life and knows all of its quirks - that a 1939 Buick that survived the attack on Pearl Harbor without a scratch is parked in a garage somewhere in town, or that when President Obama last visited he allegedly skipped out on a $63 tab at a local restaurant (a White House official says there is ""no reason to believe that the President skipped paying the bill"", though the restaurant stands by the story). Turner is also a lifelong conservative and a Trump supporter, albeit a pragmatic one - his typical observation on the candidate is: ""I just wish he'd shut the hell up."" He's not alone. Brad Parker, a staunch conservative and one of many local business owners who plans to vote Trump, agrees that the candidate often goes too far. ""What I don't like about Trump is his stand on minorities,"" says Parker. ""I hope he was just saying that to get to where he is today, but he said some things recently that has given me some doubts about whether he can ever separate himself from those racist comments."" Parker says that if Trump's rhetoric gets too extreme, he will just stay at home on election day - he refuses to vote for Clinton. Over and over again, Trump is described by people there as the ""lesser of two evils"". ""Donald Trump has got everybody scared,"" says Turner. ""These are absolutely the two worst possible candidates."" Taking a stroll outside the Speedway stadium, he runs into a former schoolmate named Ronald ""Cotton"" Emerson. Emerson is also a Trump supporter for one reason - bringing back jobs. ""It got to the point where here I am, 58 years old now, nobody will say this, but nobody wants to hire me at this age,"" says Emerson. ""A man's worthless once he's about 52,"" says Turner. ""Worthless."" It is easy to find men and women like Emerson, who can rattle off a long list of former employers. The region was known as the ""sweatshirt capital of the world"" and the saying goes it was home to more millionaires per capita than any place in the country. ""It was the manufacturing powerhouse of the whole state,"" says Beth Macy, author of Factory Man, a profile of one of the local furniture manufacturing families that has been optioned for a film version by Tom Hanks. ""The speaker of the house was from there … the whole place just had a lot of power in the '60s."" The textile factories began going to Mexico after the implementation of Nafta in 1994. Five years after Bill Clinton signed the deal, an estimated 2,600 Henry County residents were unemployed. Hillary Clinton and Nafta Once Chinese manufacturers began producing cheap furniture, the local family-run companies like Hooker, Stanley and Bassett furniture began lay offs and plant shut downs too. But things are not as bad now. Unemployment has decreased to about 6%, though that is at least in small part because many have stopped looking for work. The population of the area has also decreased, bobbing along at just under 14,000. According to Angeline Godwin, president of the Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville, this past year she had only a single student paying tuition on Trade Act funds, allocated specifically for people who had lost their jobs to international competition. ""That's a good thing, because it means we're not having plant closures,"" she says. Before making his appearance at the Speedway, Mayor Turner took a drive around Martinsville, past the burned down furniture factory where his father worked, and points out a modern, low-slung building marked Eastman Chemical Company. ""In Martinsville, they make 40% of the window film in the world, supposedly - they're a success story,"" he says as the car rolls past. ""Alcoa just has bought this place over here at the top - it's a titanium factory, brand new... this is one of the largest beef jerky places."" The plants are smaller, there are fewer jobs and many require a higher skill level, something Turner says the area has lost in the ""brain drain"" that accompanied the economic recession. Turner has high hopes that the widening of the Panama Canal will bring logistics jobs to Martinsville, thanks to the town's proximity to the Port of Virginia and Port of Savannah. ""I see an area that Nafta killed and international trade bringing this area back,"" he says. Back at the Speedway, Turner's vice mayor Jennifer Bowles arrives. A 26-year-old political newcomer, Bowles is in many ways Turner's political opposite and recently endorsed Hillary Clinton in the local newspaper. The pair say their working relationship has been good, and they often appear at events together. Although divisions between Democrats and Republicans seem to never have been deeper in this election season, Turner and Bowles don't have the option of vitriol in a small town. ""We all want what's best for Martinsville. So it's easier for us to agree,"" says Bowles. ""When it comes to national politics, that's when it gets really, really complicated."" As the fireworks are exploding over the Martinsville Speedway, 26-year-old Eli Salgado is several miles away, drinking a beer with a friend at one of the town's popular Mexican restaurants. ""I notice not many Mexican people go,"" he says of the Speedway celebration. ""They just celebrate with their families."" Salgado was brought into the country illegally from Mexico when he was four, but he was granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) status in 2012. He is a student at the local community college, and says he actually quit his job as a machine operator in a warehouse in order to take more classes and finish his degree just before the election - in case Donald Trump takes the White House. ""If they were to take away Daca, I wouldn't have it for next year, fall term,"" he says. ""I'm just not willing to take that chance."" While Henry County is 72% white, the city of Martinsville is very diverse - almost half white and half black, with a small Hispanic population that migrated to the area when jobs were plentiful. The city may actually go Democratic in the coming election, though the county - which has about three times the population of the city - is firmly Republican. Liberals like Salgado don't think the resonance that Trump is having locally is colour-blind. In a former slave-owning area, the topic of race is never far below the surface, especially in an election where polls show voting is will go along race lines - black and Hispanic voters for Clinton, and white voters for Trump, though - again, not even her own supporters in Martinsville are overly enthused by Clinton. ""It's because of her husband and that damn Nafta. She needs to realise that Nafta ruined us,"" says Naomi Hodge-Muse, leader of the local chapter of the NAACP and a Bernie Sanders supporter who has switched her allegiance to Clinton. ""Hillary does not inspire. She does not pull. That last name actually hurts her."" Hodge-Muse doesn't buy her friends' and neighbours' arguments that a vote for Trump says nothing about race - she thinks they just don't want to admit they're being manipulated by barely concealed racist rhetoric. ""We're used to code words - we understand the code,"" she says. According to Terry Smith, a professor of political science at Patrick Henry Community College and a lifelong resident of Martinsville, other social issues like abortion and gun rights can't be dismissed when explaining how Henry County turned from solidly Democratic to solidly Republican, especially in a deeply religious community that is still predominantly Southern Baptist. ""I think people started to view Democrats as too liberal or certainly more liberal on those issues,"" he says. For voters like Joe Bryant, a small business owner and a member of the Henry County board of supervisors, those social issues make his decision to vote for Trump easy. ""I'm pro-life. I don't like abortion at all… I love my guns, the Second Amendment is heavy on me,"" he says. ""Donald Trump, I think if he could just learn to control his tongue - but I think that's what people like about him."" Despite dramatic difference of opinions, Martinsville and Henry County is the kind of place where liberals and conservatives live and work together, and end up - occasionally - coming to understand each other's perspective. Two years ago, a successful industrialist from Melbourne, Australia - who asked that the BBC not used his name - moved with his family into a stately mansion once owned by one of the area's most prominent furniture families. Since moving in, he says he tries to avoid talking politics, fearing his left-of-centre views might not endear him to his new neighbours. But three weeks ago, he felt compelled to compose an email to likeminded friends in Europe and Australia. The subject line read ""Shovelling Gravel"". ""Today [I] had one of my gardeners resign, no idea why. Perhaps it was shovelling gravel for eight bucks an hour,"" he wrote. ""He was 61, he did have a middle management job at Nabisco for 22 years (he looked and sounded like a CEO). ""He had done everything right in his life - went to college, got a good job, paid for his kids to go to college, paid his health insurance, went to church on Sundays … he is basically struggling."" The email concludes, ""This is why Donald Trump's bizarre rantings resonate with so many people."" The Australian homeowner said that though he once thought Trump's popularity was fuelled only by ignorance, he's come to understand the phenomenon in a totally new light. ""I guess my opinion has changed just from being in this area. When you see how, I guess, disillusioned [people are] or you see certain areas of America have missed out on prosperity,"" he says. ""Everyone has a story really. That's just one of them.""",Donald Trump stunned the political world by storming the primary contests to become the Republican Party's nominee for president. And one county in the key battleground state of Virginia offers some answers as to how he did it - and why so many people want him rather than Hillary Clinton to be the next resident of the White House.
"He died due to compression on his neck and back by Minneapolis police officers, medical examiners hired by the Floyd family said. The findings differ from an official preliminary examination carried out by the county medical examiner. It did not find evidence of ""traumatic asphyxia or strangulation"". The official examination also said underlying health conditions played a role in Mr Floyd's death. But the two doctors hired by the Floyd family found the death was a homicide, a statement from its legal team said. ""The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing,"" Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and one of the pair, said at a news conference. A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on George Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe sparked outrage when it emerged a week ago. It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen this widely across the country in decades. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, told Monday's news conference: ""Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers."" He added: ""The ambulance was his hearse."" Dr Baden said there was ""no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death"". The findings contradict those of a preliminary post-mortem examination that was included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The medical examiner noted in that report that Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and said the combination of these, ""potential intoxicants in his system"" and being restrained by the officers ""likely contributed to his death"". The full official death examination is yet to be released by the office of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. It says it is awaiting more results from laboratory studies. The Floyd family and their lawyers say the charge against Mr Chauvin should be increased to first-degree murder. They say the private post-mortem examination proves two other officers filmed kneeling on his back also contributed to his death. What's the latest on protests? More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Police cars were burned, buildings were torched and shops looted in several places. Dozens of cities imposed curfews but they were defied. On Monday, President Trump told state governors they had been ""weak"" and had to get ""much tougher"", and utilise troops from the National Guard, thousands of whom have already been activated in two dozen states. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media. There have been scenes of violence in Washington DC in recent nights, including near the White House. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings including a historic church known as the church of the presidents overnight on Sunday. Many videos shared on social media from across the US appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. Dozens of attacks targeting journalists have been reported. The curfew in Washington DC has been extended for another two nights and will start at 19:00 on Monday. A curfew starting at 23:00 had been in effect on Sunday. New York City is also imposing a citywide curfew on Monday from 23:00 until 05:00 on Tuesday. ""The violence and the looting has been bad for the city, the state and this entire national movement, undermining and distracting from this righteous cause,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.","George Floyd, the African-American man whose death has sparked civil unrest, died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen), a private post-mortem examination found."
"He started his business in 1997 with an investment of less than $100 (£63) which he had saved while he was in Germany as a student. He told the BBC's African Dream series that he used part of that money to rent a house and the rest to buy steel products which were transformed into shovels and door hinges. ""Then we sold that and we ploughed a profit into the business,"" he said. That initial profit was used to acquire scrap materials. ""Indeed, we are able to convert waste to wealth,"" Mr Kamara pointed out. According to him, his company, Fomel Industry and National Industrialisation Centre (Finic), is now worth around $1m. The firm is based in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, and manufactures rice milling machines, palm nut crackers, palm oil processing plants, fruit juice making equipment and, as a sideline, condom dispensers. Import dependency Mr Kamara told the BBC's Lansana Fofana that his inspiration stemmed out of his passion for mechanical things. He added proudly that he is contributing to the reduction of Sierra Leone's import dependency. The country's infrastructure and economy have been improving considerably since it emerged from a decade of civil war in 2002. ""Before now we had difficulties with energy but now we have almost 100% availability of energy, and that is a very strong motivating factor,"" the entrepreneur said. Mr Kamara explained that although his company still has to import some things which cannot be produced locally - like the engines needed to power equipments - it is building the biggest agricultural machinery centre in the country. His long-term vision is to extend his business to every district of Sierra Leone and to venture into the renewable sector. ""We want to do biomass gasification which we can utilise in the production of electricity for rural electrification,"" he said. 'One condom at a time' Mr Kamara told BBC Africa that the idea of producing condom vending machines actually came from the United Nations Population Fund. ""They contacted us and then we did a design which can dispense one condom at a time, and then when they saw that, they were so much amused that they asked us to do one that can dispense packets. ""Now we're producing machines that can dispense one packet at a time after the insertion of a 200 leones coin ($0.05, £0.03),"" he said. These machines will be placed in entertainment centres, guest houses, hotels and probably outside pharmacies. ""To bring the business to this level, many factors contribute but a very important one is for one to be tenacious,"" Mr Kamara said. ""Tenacity is very important and also passion is very important. If you have the passion and you have the tenacity, a lot of things you can make happen."" To make your entrepreneurial dreams come true you also have to be a good employer, he suggested. ""One challenge is actually the problem of getting people to do what you want and then getting people to accept change readily but a way to circumvent it, a way to reduce those challenges is to make the people feel important,"" he said. ""I think it's an area that every person aspiring to be in business should know, and no matter how good your ideas are, always remember to table them for discussion to those who work with you. ""Otherwise they will see themselves as being excluded in the process and therefore they will find it very difficult to be motivated to do the work."" African Dream is broadcast on the BBC Network Africa programme every Monday morning. Every week, one successful business man or woman will explain how they started off and what others could learn from them.","Sierra Leone's Foday Melvin Kamara trained as an automobile engineer but, instead of manufacturing vehicles, he specialises in turning old car parts into agro-processing equipment and condom machines."
"A post-mortem examination revealed two kinds of fentanyl, heroin and cocaine in his system. Police found Mr Kroll dead in his Manhattan flat in December after being asked to check in on him by a woman reported to be his girlfriend. The 34-year-old was also the co-founder of the video platform Vine. The medical examiner's office ruled Mr Kroll's 16 December death an accident, due to ""acute intoxication"" from the combined effects of the drugs. Fentanyl - a synthetic opioid 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine - and a variant, fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl, were both found in Mr Kroll's system. Mr Kroll's death was suspected to be due to an overdose after police found his body without signs of trauma and with drug paraphernalia nearby. He was reportedly found face down on his bed, and police noted signs of what appeared to be cocaine and heroin in the flat. Mr Kroll's friends and family remembered him as a kind, talented young man. His former fiancé Maggie Neuwald told the New York Post after his death that he had struggled with the pace of the tech industry. ""It's not like anyone hands you … a manual of how to deal with [success],"" she said. ""That probably, unfortunately, got the best of him, although I had hoped he'd be able to fight those demons."" Last year, the Centers for Disease Control found synthetic opioid-related overdose death rates had risen by 45% on average across the country in one year. Mr Kroll had been named CEO of the HQ Trivia mobile app in September. He founded the game with Rus Yusupov. The live trivia game became hugely popular, although its appeal waned last year. The free app was guest-hosted by some famous faces, including Jimmy Kimmel and Bert from Sesame Street. Vine was a popular a six-second video streaming service that Twitter purchased in 2012 for $30m (£24m) and eventually discontinued in 2016.","The co-founder of the popular app HQ Trivia, Colin Kroll, died of an accidental drug overdose, according to the New York City medical examiner."
"The US faced ""growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia"", he said, unveiling the national defence strategy. In an apparent reference to Russia, he warned against ""threaten[ing] America's experiment in democracy"". ""If you challenge us, it will be your longest and worst day,"" he warned. America has been gripped by ongoing investigations into alleged collusion between the Trump 2016 election campaign and Russia. Speaking in Washington, Mr Mattis also appealed to Congress to fund the military adequately and refrain from ""indiscriminate and automatic cuts"" to the US federal budget. President Donald Trump is seeking to boost defence spending by 10%, or $54bn (£43bn), in his proposed budget plan for this year, and hopes to recoup that sum through deep cuts elsewhere, including to foreign aid. America's competitive edge 'fast eroding' By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent The publication of the Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy signals an important shift in Washington's priorities. For almost two decades - ever since the attacks of 9/11 - America's military focus has been on fighting terrorism, with counter-insurgency campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. But now there is to be a renewed emphasis on inter-state strategic competition - matching so-called peer competitors like Russia and China. US Defence Secretary James Mattis is right when he says that Washington's competitive military edge is fast eroding. There needs to be investment in a range of new technologies that might provide the edge on a future battlefield. But it is not simply a matter of spending more money. He pointed to the difficulty of passing budgets on Capitol Hill over successive years which, he said, had done more damage to US military readiness than any enemy in the field. How much have US defence priorities changed? This is the first time the defence policies of the Trump administration have been spelled out in one place. The threats listed are the same as under the Obama administration but the order of priority is different. Formerly, jihadist militant groups like Islamic State or al-Qaeda were the focus but latterly America's former Cold War opponents, Russia and China, have reasserted themselves strategically. ""We face growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia, nations that seek to create a world consistent with their authoritarian models,"" Mr Mattis said. A summary of the new strategy was published on the defence department's website. How big a threat to America are Russia and China? The three great nuclear powers have posed a permanent existential threat to each other since Cold War days. In recent years, however, fears have risen of the once-unthinkable: a direct conventional clash, particularly between Russia and the US in Syria or Ukraine. The new strategy recognises that ""China and Russia in particular have been assiduously working over a number of years to develop their military capabilities to challenge our military advantages"", said Elbridge Colby, US deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development. ""This strategy really represents a fundamental shift to say, look, we have to get back, in a sense, to the basics of the potential for war and this strategy says the focus will be on prioritising preparedness for war, in particular major power war,"" he added. What pitch for funding did Mr Mattis make? The national defence strategy provides guidance for the 2019 defence budget. While the US was ""still strong"", the defence secretary said, its competitive edge had ""eroded in every domain of warfare - air, land, sea, space and cyberspace - and is continually eroding"". Appealing to Congress, he said: ""No strategy can survive without predictable funding. As hard as the last 16 years [that is, since the 9/11 attacks] have been, no enemy has harmed the US military more than defence spending caps and sequestration."" Referring to the current wrangle in the Senate over a bill to fund federal agencies temporarily, he said a shutdown would have an impact on military operations. ""Our maintenance activities will probably pretty much shut down...over 50%, altogether of my civilian workforce will be furloughed..."" he said. ""We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, those obviously would stop.""","US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said competition between great powers, not terrorism, is now the main focus of America's national security."
"On Saturday, the country's military leadership agreed to establish an 18-month interim government until an election could take place. It followed three days of talks with opposition and civil society groups. But the M5-RFP group, which took part in the negotiations, said the resulting document was an attempt by military leaders to ""grab and confiscate power"". It also said the document did not take into account what it said was a majority vote for a civilian interim leader, and ""did not reflect the views and decisions of the Malian people"". West Africa's regional bloc, Ecowas, had also called for the interim president to be a civilian, but the military leadership says a civilian or a soldier can fill the role. The interim charter announced by the military leaders also states that an interim legislative body is to be established comprising M5-RFP members. Mali is struggling with intense Islamist and ethnic violence, as well as a faltering economy. The BBC's Africa Editor Mary Harper says the deep tensions between the military and the group which led enormous protests against ex-President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta only threatens further instability. What happened to the former president? The ousted former president left the country last week. The 75-year-old former leader flew to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 5 September for medical treatment, after suffering a minor stroke, military officials said. His former chief of staff said he could be away for up to 15 days. After the coup, West African leaders said they wanted a rapid return to civilian rule. Mali's new military rulers had previously said they wanted the interim period to last for two years. ""We make a commitment before you to spare no effort in the implementation of all these resolutions in the exclusive interest of the Malian people,"" Col Assimi Goita, the head of Mali's military junta, said. President Keïta was overthrown on 18 August following mass protests against his rule over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and a dispute over legislative elections. The coup sparked international condemnation, but it was welcomed by many Malians. Mr Keïta was detained by the military, but later freed. This was the fourth coup in the West African state since it gained independence from France in 1960. A previous coup in 2012 led to militant Islamists exploiting the instability to seize territory in northern Mali. French troops helped regain territory, but attacks continue.

"The department has altered its policy on the collection of plastic, allowing most types of packaging to be deposited at the island's bring banks. Previously, plastic marked with a 1, 2, 5 or 6 was accepted. Now all plastic packaging except black items, thin films and polystyrene are allowed. The department said the move would help to collect more plastic for recycling. Deputy Scott Ogier, Deputy Minister for Public Services, said: ""The message for islanders is very simple: unless it is one of these items, we want whatever household plastic packaging you have."" He added the exceptions were in place to stop recyclable material becoming contaminated by non-recyclables. The change to regulations has been put in place partly due to confusion caused by unclear packaging. The Public Services Department said the numbers printed on plastic packaging were often unclear or too small to read.",A move to simplify the recycling of plastic in Guernsey has been announced by the Public Services Department.
"No official reason has been given for the death of Seif Sharif Hamad, popularly known as Maalim Seif, at the age of 77. He was the most prominent politician in Tanzania to have openly declared that he had the virus. Health experts have accused the authorities in Tanzania of downplaying the threat posed by Covid-19. Tanzanian President John Magufuli has called for prayers and herbal remedies to counter it. Mr Hamad was a senior member of the opposition ACT Wazalendo party, which has been critical of the government's policy on Covid. The BBC's Aboubakar Famau looks back at Mr Hamad's life. Thousands of supporters of Mr Hamad would flock to political rallies in Zanzibar just to catch a glimpse of him. His eloquence, charisma and obvious power while on the political stage made him a force to be reckoned with. This former teacher - hence his name, Maalim, meaning ""teacher"" in Swahili - would attract both men and women, young and old, rich and poor, to his rallies. They would all be clad in party regalia, chanting political slogans. ""We are where you are,"" they would shout in a demonstration of their unwavering loyalty and dedication. But they regarded him as more than a politician. They saw him as a fatherly figure who relentlessly fought for their rights. And they were loyal to him rather than to his party, which was evident last year when Mr Hamad decided to leave the Civic United Front (Cuf), in which he had served as general secretary since its formation in 1992. Six unsuccessful presidential bids His departure was over an internal wrangle and thousands of his supporters followed him to the ACT-Wazalendo party. He started his political life as a member of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, but was expelled in 1988 after falling out with the leadership. While with CCM, he served as Zanzibar's chief minister between 1984 and 1988. The position was later renamed vice-president. In opposition he ran unsuccessfully for president of Zanzibar six times. Some of the polls were marred by irregularities and gross human rights abuses. The worst post-poll violence was in January 2001 where more than a dozen of his supporters were shot dead in the island of Pemba as they were protesting against results of the 2000 election. Nevertheless, it was obvious that time was running out as illness and age were both taking their toll on Mr Hamad. You may also be interested in: Unlike in other general elections, in the 2020 campaign he was visibly frail, asking for physical support from his bodyguards as he climbed on stage. He was detained several times, most recently in October on the eve of the general election. He was later released. In the wake of this defeat in the election, in a reconciliatory move by Zanzibar's President Hussein Mwinyi, he was appointed as first vice-president for a second term. He may never have achieved his dream of winning the top job, but joining President Mwinyi's unity government would have probably been some consolation to him.","The vice-president of Tanzania's semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar has died, nearly three weeks after his party said he had contracted Covid-19."
"Russian media say Nikolai Gorokhov fell from the fourth floor when a rope snapped as he and others tried to lift a bathtub into his house near Moscow. He was flown to hospital by helicopter, a medical source was quoted as saying. However, British businessman Bill Browder, for whom Mr Magnitsky worked, said he had been ""thrown"". He did not give a source for his allegation. According to a press release released by a website linked to Mr Browder, Law and Order in Russia, Mr Gorokhov was due to appear in an appeals court in Moscow on Wednesday to contest its refusal to investigate allegations of organised crime. Mr Magnitsky died in prison after revealing alleged fraud by state officials. Read more: The incident involving Mr Gorokhov occurred in the town of Troitsk, south-west of Moscow. Russian media said several workmen were helping the lawyer at the time. Footage on Russian media showed pictures of the tub and the debris of a wooden structure beside it. One man described as a witness told Russia channel NTV that a delivery company had offered to carry the tub up to the fourth floor but that Mr Gorokhov had said he would winch it up the side of the building himself. ""He tried to use a homemade mechanism to lift it to the fourth floor. While he was doing that the winch got jammed. He went to fix it a bit and fell, with the jacuzzi and the makeshift scaffolding which landed on top of him,"" he said. His comments appeared to indicate the workmen were on the ground at the time of the accident. Who was Sergei Magnitsky? Mr Magnitsky was jailed after being accused of committing fraud himself. Supporters say his death in November 2009 was the result of a severe beating, but official records say he died of acute heart failure and toxic shock, caused by untreated pancreatitis. Mr Magnitsky had acted as a legal adviser for London-based Hermitage Capital Management, founded by Mr Browder (formerly a US citizen), who was himself tried in absentia. The Magnitsky affair soured relations between Moscow and Washington, casting a spotlight on corruption in Russia. It led to US sanctions on a group of Russian officials, retaliation by Russia and the bizarre spectacle of Mr Magnitsky being put on trial posthumously.","A lawyer for the family of Sergei Magnitsky, the lawyer whose death in 2009 sparked a crisis between Russia and the West, has been badly injured."
"On Thursday, some 240 people were injured in protests in Georgia. The protests were ignited by the appearance of a Russian MP in the country's parliament. Mr Putin signed a decree on Friday suspending flights to Georgia by Russian airlines. The suspensions will start from 8 July. A transport statement on Saturday said the reason for the latest suspension was to ""ensure a sufficient level of air security and arrears"" owed by Georgian companies. The Kremlin said the suspension on Russian airlines flying to Georgia was to ""ensure Russia's national security and protect Russian nationals from criminal and other unlawful activities."" Tensions between the countries remain high, 11 years after they fought a war over the region of South Ossetia. On Saturday, a news team from Russian state TV was attacked by two men on the street in the capital, Tbilisi. Nobody appeared to have been seriously hurt in the incident, which was captured on film. What other action is Putin taking? Mr Putin has ordered plans to be made to help bring back Russian citizens already in Georgia. Moscow also recommended that Russian travel agencies suspend all tours to Georgia. Several thousand Russian tourists are currently in Georgia, Russian tour agency representative Maia Lomidze told Russian media. According to Russian data, about half a million Russians have visited Georgia to date this year while 1.7 million Russian tourists went there last year. ""Tourism in Georgia is on the rise, and the decision has shocked the whole industry,"" Aleksan Mkrtchyan, who runs a chain of Russian travel agents, said in a statement. ""Georgians have traditionally treated Russians well,"" Irina Tyurina, a spokeswoman for the Russian Tourism Union, told AFP News agency. Deep frustrations on show Analysis by Rayhan Demytrie in Tbilisi Protesters gathered again on Friday night outside the Georgian parliament building where they have been chanting ""No to Russia"" over and over again. But they have motives that extend beyond denouncing Moscow. These demonstrators want the Georgian Interior Minister Giorgi Gakharia to resign over his handling of the unrest. They are also angry at how the police dealt with Thursday's protests. Tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon were used to push back the crowd in what were ugly scenes. And on Friday, protesters came out in bigger numbers. It appears the visit of a Russian MP has unlocked much deeper frustrations with the current administration and the way it has handled relations with its northern neighbour. What caused the protests? Sergei Gavrilov, the Russian MP who sparked the fury, had addressed an assembly of MPs from Orthodox Christian nations on Thursday. He had been taking part in the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy (IAO) - a body set up by the Greek parliament in 1993 to foster relations between Christian Orthodox lawmakers. Opposition MPs in Georgia's parliament called for protests after he delivered his speech in Russian from the Speaker's seat. ""That was a slap in the face of recent Georgian history,"" Elene Khoshtaria, an opposition member of parliament, said. Thousands of protesters tried to storm the parliament, and police used rubber bullets and tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. Some protesters carried EU flags and placards reading ""Russia is an occupier"". Giga Bokeria, an opposition MP for the European Georgia party, told AFP news agency the rally outside parliament had been ""a spontaneous protest by ordinary Georgians"". The Speaker of the parliament, Irakli Kobakhidze, resigned following the violence. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili called Russia ""an enemy and occupier"", saying Moscow had helped to stir the unrest. The Kremlin condemned the protests as ""Russophobic provocation"", while Russia's foreign ministry accused Georgia's opposition of trying to prevent an improvement in bilateral relations. Why are there tensions between Georgia and Russia? When Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, separatist conflicts erupted in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In August 2008, Georgia attempted to recapture South Ossetia. Russia poured troops in, ousting Georgian forces and only halting their advance within striking distance of Tbilisi. Following a ceasefire, Russia withdrew most of its troops from undisputed parts of Georgia but still maintains a military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, recognising both as ""independent"" states. Since then, diplomatic relations between Russia and Georgia have remained clouded by mutual suspicion. Georgia has ambitions to join the European Union and Nato, a prospect viewed dimly by Russia. However, bilateral trade and tourism had been growing in recent years.",President Vladimir Putin has temporarily banned Georgian airlines from flying to Russia amid rising tensions between the two countries.
"There were reports of beatings and detentions by police, and video footage showed water cannon being used. Several hundred people earlier attended Mr Lukashenko's swearing-in ceremony for a sixth term. One opposition member described it as a ""thieves' meeting"". The opposition says last month's poll was rigged in Mr Lukashenko's favour. The country's electoral commission said Mr Lukashenko won more than 80% of the vote, triggering weeks of mass protests across the country. Several EU countries and the US say they do not recognise Mr Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus. Rising tension in Minsk Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News The inauguration of Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday morning appears to have changed the mood of both Belarus's demonstrators and the security forces. In the capital Minsk protesters were more confrontational, blocking roads and at times chasing the police vehicles away. In response, water cannon was used and masked riot police used tactics that haven't been seen since the violent days immediately after the disputed election in August. Video posted to Telegram channels shows batons being used on crowds and both men and women with bloody injuries to their heads. During his inaugural address, Mr Lukashenko spoke as if the protests that followed the election were over. That's clearly not the case. How was Wednesday's inauguration different? Presidential inaugurations are normally publicised well in advance as major state occasions. Instead, state news agency Belta reported on Wednesday: ""Alexander Lukashenko has taken office as President of Belarus. The inauguration ceremony is taking place in these minutes in the Palace of Independence."" Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the former Soviet republic for 26 years, said Belarus needed security and consensus ""on the brink of a global crisis"", an apparent reference to the coronavirus pandemic, Belta reported. ""I cannot, I have no right to abandon the Belarusians,"" he added. How has the opposition reacted? The opposition Nexta Live channel on the Telegram messaging app called for street protests from 18:00 local time (15:00 GMT) and urged drivers to block roads and create traffic jams. ""Starting from this very day, he [Lukashenko] officially becomes a bandit and fraudster who is not recognised anywhere in the civilised world,"" the channel said. On Wednesday evening, protesters marched to the centre of Minsk, some wearing fake crowns to mock the inauguration. One placard read: ""The king has no clothes!"" But there is a heavy police presence and a number of people have been detained. Mr Lukashenko's main political rival, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania amid mass arrests, said ""after today [he] is neither a legal nor a legitimate head of Belarus"". Fellow opposition politician Pavel Latushko posted on social media: ""Where are the jubilant citizens? Where is the diplomatic corps?"" ""It is obvious that Alexander Lukashenko is exclusively the president of the Omon (riot police) and a handful of lying officials."" He called for ""an indefinite action of civil disobedience"". Meanwhile, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius described the inauguration as a ""farce"" and ""illegitimate"" on Twitter. What is the background? Mr Lukashenko, 66, claimed a sixth term as president in the widely disputed election of 9 August. He insisted that he had won fairly with 80% of the vote and depicted the protests against him as a Western-backed plot. Earlier this month, he secured a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) loan from Russia. Ms Tikhanovskaya claims to have won 60-70% in places where votes were properly counted. Many opposition figures are now in self-imposed exile in neighbouring countries amid a wave of arrests. Despite the crackdown, anti-government protests show no signs of diminishing. On Sunday, a crowd of about 100,000 people staged another rally in the capital, demanding that Mr Lukashenko step down","Mass street protests are continuing in Belarus's capital Minsk, following the inauguration of President Alexander Lukashenko at an unannounced ceremony."
"Private Joseph Hammond walked two miles (3.2km) a day for a week in May, raising $35,000 (£28,000) for frontline health workers and veterans in Africa. ""I was overwhelmed and filled with joy,"" he said on hearing he was to get a Commonwealth Point of Light award. He said he had been inspired by fellow veteran Capt Tom Moore, who raised more than £32m in the UK to fight Covid-19. Capt Moore completed 100 laps of his garden in the run-up to his 100th birthday in April for NHS charities. This prompted Pte Hammond to start his own campaign to raise money to buy personal protection equipment (PPE) for health workers and to protect vulnerable veterans on the African continent. He started each day's walk in the capital, Accra, early in the morning so he could complete his two miles before the heat and humidity of the day peaked, reports the BBC's Thomas Naadi. He wants to raise about $600,000 in total, so the former Ghanaian soldier, who like Capt Moore fought in Burma, hopes donations will continue to be made, our reporter says. 'He is a force of nature' Iain Walker, the UK high commissioner to Ghana who joined Pte Hammond on his walk, said the Queen presented Points of Light awards to outstanding volunteers across the Commonwealth who changed the lives of their community. ""Pte Hammond exemplifies these qualities. It has been a privilege to get to know Pte Hammond and to experience his selflessness,"" he said. ""He is a force of nature and an inspiration to many, including me."" Pte Hammond, who was drafted into the Royal West African Frontier Force at the age 16, will receive the award at the UK High Commission in Accra at a date still to be decided. ""This is marvellous, this is wonderful, it's beyond my comprehension,"" he tweeted in a video produced by the Guba Foundation and Forces Help Africa, the two non-governmental organisations helping him in his fundraising efforts. ""Surprises keep coming - I'm short of words, I don't know what to say,"" he said. Earlier this month, he had received a letter from Prince Harry, the Queen's grandson, commending him on his walk. Pte Hammond had met Prince Harry, who works to support veterans, during an event at the Field of Remembrance in the grounds of Westminster Abbey in London last year. Three years after the end of World War Two, Ghana, then the Gold Coast, was rocked by riots following the killing of three Ghanaian veterans who had been demanding compensation for their service during the conflict. It became a milestone in Ghana's struggle for independence from the UK, which was achieved in 1957.",A 95-year-old Ghanaian World War Two veteran is to be honoured by Queen Elizabeth for his fundraising efforts.
"The Irish government document said the IRA's so-called army council told two prison chaplains that it was prepared to talk to the UK government. But its least favourite approach was to involve Sinn Féin. It said some Provisional IRA chiefs were averse to the ""socialist views being espoused"" by the party's leaders. The message from a senior Irish official to colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has been made public after being kept in the Republic of Ireland's National Archives - under file reference number 2020/17/34. 260900 DEC 20 - for 30 years. 'Exploratory discussions' Rev Will Murphy and Fr John Murphy, who were chaplains at the Maze Prison, had been engaged in a two-year process to encourage loyalist and republican prisoners to move away from violence. On 4 May, 1990, Brendan McMahon, head of the Anglo-Irish Division, updated Dermot Gallagher, the assistant secretary at the DFA, on the potential breakthrough with the IRA. ""I had a conversation with Fr Murphy on 2 May who indicated that they had just concluded a series of intensive discussions with the IRA army council,"" he said. ""Arising from those discussions, the two chaplains had a meeting on 1 May with the four church leaders. ""At that meeting, the chaplains reported that the army council had clearly indicated to them their willingness to seek an alternative to the campaign of violence and, with this objective in mind, are prepared to enter exploratory discussions with the British government."" Mr McMahon added: ""The army council's preference is naturally for such talks to be held in public, though they accept that any talks would probably have to be conducted in absolute secrecy. ""The IRA's third, and least favoured, option would be for talks involving Sinn Féin. ""Fr Murphy commented that one thing which has struck him in the course of this initiative is the noticeable difference between the IRA and Sinn Féin - with army council members referring to Sinn Féin as merely ""the party which is the closest to our view"". The 1990 Irish state papers also reveal that the accession of John Major as UK prime minister was regarded by the Irish government as an ""important opportunity"". 'Little knowledge' Mr Major was seen as less likely to back the cause of unionism as strongly as his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, an internal Irish government communique reported. A note, dated 12 December 1990, written by Dermot Gallagher to then-taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Charles Haughey said: ""The indications are that, as of now, Major has no fixed views or indeed little knowledge about Northern Ireland. ""At the same time, by instinct and temperament, the new prime minister is likely to find the unionist posture essentially anachronistic. ""Unionist rhetoric - which at least at times struck a chord with Margaret Thatcher - will sit uneasily with his pragmatism. ""To the extent that the nationalist case can be couched in terms of logic and common sense, there may be a real possibility of enlisting Major's sympathy and support."" On 30 July 1990, Former Eastbourne MP Ian Gow, who was Margaret Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, died when the IRA detonated a bomb under his car. The same note also speculates that the UK took the view that the Provisional IRA can ""continue their campaign of violence indefinitely at the present, or even at an increased, level"". ""This has horrendous implications for their security forces and also for the protection of public persons in Britain. ""The Leader of the House, John MacGregor, privately emphasised to the minister on Monday how shaken the Conservative Party had been - and still is - by Ian Gow's murder."" The note said that the chief constable in Northern Ireland had ""emphasised the scale of the security problem"" by saying that 5,000 British troops ""could be swallowed up in any one area of the border"". ""The British, I suspect, also realise that the Provisionals have the capacity, in the absence of draconian security measures, to bring down any new political structures in the north which exclude them,"" it added. The newly published papers are contained in National Archives file reference number 2020/17/10. 260900 DEC 20.","The IRA wanted to exclude Sinn Féin from proposed ceasefire talks with the British government, according to newly-released Irish state papers from 1990."
"The gathering, which will take place in Pyongyang from 6 May, will be only the seventh in the party's history and the first under leader Kim Jong-un. It will be closely watched for signs of major policy shifts, movement among senior officials or comment on North Korea's nuclear programme. It comes as North Korea is believed to be preparing a fifth nuclear test. North Korea has often timed its controversial tests to coincide with big political occasions. Its fourth test, in January, was followed by the launch of a satellite. Both were violations of existing sanctions and resulted in the UN imposing further measures limiting trade and contact with the North. The last North Korean congress was in October 1980, before the current leader Mr Kim was born. It lasted four days and among other issues saw Kim Jong-il formally named as the intended successor to then leader Kim Il-sung. Expectation has been growing for months that the leadership was about to announce the seventh congress. The statement from North Korea's KCNA news agency on Wednesday gave no details of the event, and did not specify how long it would last. But it is widely expected that Mr Kim will use the gathering to both reinforce his role as Supreme Leader and to push his agenda of economic development coupled with nuclear progress. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said on Tuesday that the North had finished preparations for its fifth nuclear test and could carry it out it any time. It would be the latest show of defiance to the international community in recent weeks, which have seen a series of missile launches. The North also claimed last week to have used ""cold launch"" technology to fire a missile from a submarine, while South Korean officials say it also appears to be preparing another test launch of its medium-range Musudan ballistic missile.",North Korea has said its ruling Workers Party will hold its first congress in nearly 40 years next month.
"""When I was an 18-year-old boy, exploring what it was to be a gay man, you could be arrested for having sex with another man in Queensland,"" he said. The 47-year-old, who still lives in Brisbane, says although that law is now gone and the Australian state recognises his relationship with his long term partner, it won't let them marry. It has been a long engagement for Australian same-sex couples as it remains unclear if they will ever have the chance to legally wed. Here are some of the weddings in waiting as the marriage equality debate returns again to the political agenda. Richard and Michael - 'One day he will be very sick' ""My partner has a very serious neurological disease and I am always very conscious that I need to explain my relationship with him,"" said Mr Steer. ""I have a real legitimate fear that one day he will be very sick and somebody will stop me from going into his room to be with him."" The economics consultant met his partner, Michael Batt, 44, in a pub on a Sunday afternoon. About 10 years later they had a commitment ceremony to celebrate their relationship. ""Our friends and family call it our wedding, but it wasn't legal,"" he said. The Brisbane pair, who have been together for 14 years, will marry again if it becomes legal in Australia. ""There are extended legal rights that you get through marriage,"" he said. ""If [Michael] was on life support and I was not recognised as his partner that really concerns me. If I was married, I'd have a piece of paper to prove it."" Annette and Kylie - Annulment was 'a terrible feeling' Annette Cairnduf, 48, and Kylie Gwynne, 50, were married legally in Australia's capital, but a day later it was annulled. ""This marriage, of two people who had been together for 13 years, was declared invalid - so we're not married anymore. But we were for 24 hours,"" Annette Cairnduff said. A High Court ruling that fell a day after their wedding also quashed the hopes of 31 other newlywed couples who had made vows during a brief window in 2013 when same-sex marriages were legal in the Australian Capital Territory. ""We joke about when we have our second marriage, I will marry my second wife,"" she said. The Sydneysider, who had never before considered getting married, said it was a ""huge blow"" to have her garden wedding ruled unlawful only hours later.

"Mr Kilic was speaking at the opening of his trial in Izmir, western Turkey. He has been in custody since June, accused of links to Fethullah Gulen, the US-based Muslim cleric seen by President Erdogan as a subversive traitor. Eight other human rights activists were released on bail on Wednesday. Mr Kilic is also a defendant in that separate case, in which activists face similar terrorism charges. Amnesty says the charges are politically motivated - an attempt to silence critics of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cracked down hard on opponents since the coup attempt. ""There are inconcrete and unclear accusations in the indictment, and there is no concrete evidence"" to prove any links to Mr Gulen, Mr Kilic was quoted as saying. He said the authorities' statements had violated his right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence. Mr Gulen has denied any role in the coup plot, which was led by rogue military officers. Mr Kilic is accused of using an encrypted messaging application called ByLock, which the authorities say Gulen supporters shared to avoid detection. Mr Kilic's denial was tweeted by Amnesty's Turkey researcher Andrew Gardner, who quoted him as saying two forensic reports found no trace of ByLock ever having been downloaded on his phone. He and the other activists face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. In Wednesday's separate trial, eight defendants were freed on bail, while two others had been released earlier. Mr Kilic is the 11th defendant in that case. The next court hearing is scheduled for 22 November. Turkey is still ruled under the state of emergency imposed after the failed coup attempt. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended in a crackdown.","The indicted head of Amnesty International in Turkey, Taner Kilic, has denied alleged membership of the ""terrorist"" group blamed for the July 2016 coup attempt."
"Mr Castro, quoted by state television, said the timetable for the cuts would be altered to soften their impact. The redundancies form part of plans to revive Cuba's struggling economy, an issue due to be discussed at a rare Communist Party Congress in April. The Cuban government currently employs about 85% of the official workforce. President Castro, addressing a joint meeting of his cabinet and the Council of State, said given the lay-offs were behind schedule, the timeline would be adjusted, state television reported. ""A job of this magnitude which will affect so many citizens in one way or another cannot be marked by inflexible timetables,"" the report quoted him as saying. Privileges President Castro did not give a new target date for the planned redundancies, saying only that the overhaul of the economy would take at least five years. He again insisted that the reforms would ""leave nobody behind"". Last September, Mr Castro announced plans to lay off about a million state employees - about a fifth of the workforce - with half the jobs going by 31 March. This would have been just three weeks before the first congress of the ruling Communist Party in 14 years. Thousands of committees have been set up across the island to decide which jobs to eliminate and discuss the planned changes to the economy. According to state TV, the economy minister, Marino Murillo, said some seven million Cubans had taken part in a total of nearly 130,000 such meetings. But resistance among those supposed to implementing the cuts has clearly had an effect. BBC Mundo's Cuba correspondent Fernando Ravsberg says a major weakness of the reforms is that those supposed to be implementing them have most to lose in terms of economic interests and privileges. As well as lay-offs, the Cuban government has been taking steps to ease some restrictions on private enterprise, allowing Cubans to apply for licences to run their own businesses, rent out rooms and in some case hire workers. President Castro has said that the reforms are vital to overhauling the economy, which is burdened by debt and costly social programmes, as well as the effects of the long-standing US trade embargo.","Cuba's plans to lay off half a million state workers by the end of March are behind schedule, President Raul Castro has acknowledged."
"President Andrzej Duda formalised the move on Monday meaning that a third of top judges will now be reinstated. The government controversially lowered the retirement age for judges earlier this year, forcing many to quit, in what critics said was a political move by the ruling Law and Justice Party. The EU's top court ordered Poland to suspend the application of the law. Critics said the law helped give Law and Justice (PiS) political control of the Supreme Court. The PiS has already appointed the majority of judges to the Constitutional Tribunal, which has the power to veto legislation, and also controls the body that nominates all judges in Poland. It argued that the reforms were needed to remove judges appointed during the communist era and to make the court more efficient. Why the government U-turn? The European Court of Justice's ruling in October was requested by the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - which argued that the reforms undermined the rule of law because they gave the governing party political control of the judiciary. On Monday, this decision was upheld and President Duda had until midnight to decide whether to comply. But the government had already agreed to scrap the law saying it respected the court's decision. ""We are members of the European Union and we will abide by European Union law,"" the head of the PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said last month. What was the law? The Supreme Court law, which lowered the retirement age for judges from 70 to 65, was introduced in July and triggered widespread street protests. More than 20 judges - about a third of the total - were forced to retire but will now be able to return to work. Opponents had feared the PiS would use the law to appoint new judges loyal to the authorities. One such opponent was the head of the Supreme Court, who refused to stand down and argued that Poland's constitution guaranteed her the right to serve a six-year term. Chief Justice Malgorzata Gersdor, 65, branded the reforms a ""purge"". The conservative government denied the accusations, and argued that the country's judiciary had not been properly reformed after the end of communism in 1989.",Poland's government has reinstated a number of Supreme Court judges whom it had forced into early retirement.
"President Barack Obama managed, during his recent African Union speech, to use almost 400 words to tell us that it is a good thing to have limits on presidential terms. The truth is many people on this continent do know this, despite President Pierre Nkurunziza's recent re-election in Burundi. African countries started independent and constitutional life with term limits clearly spelled out. But whenever they became inconvenient, parliaments simply amended the rules and the constitutions to allow third or fourth terms or declared Presidents for Life. Justifying longevity Often, these amendments came with the enthusiastic support of academics, local and foreign, who found theories to support whatever changes the leader wanted. The theories ranged from African Socialism to Nkrumahism - the ideology based on the philosophy of Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah. At the heart of it all was the idea that a particular leader was special and without him, the country would disintegrate. Or, as Louis XV, who reigned France for almost 60 years, reportedly said ""apres lui, le deluge"" (after me, the flood). This was said about all the first presidents and even if they didn't start like this, they came to believe it themselves. The soldiers who staged the coups and ruled much of Africa in the 70s and 80s said it about themselves and sycophantic followers and academics for hire endorsed them. The freedom fighters who marched into the capitals and overthrew colonial powers or indigenous autocrats said so about themselves and proceeded to turn into worse dictators before our very eyes. Obscene opulence Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire used to say it and so did Brother Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Any criticism about having been in power for too long was answered with: They held their countries together. You had to wonder if it was possible that Mobutu's Zaire could possibly get any worse than it was under his corrupt rule. In the event, after he was ousted from power, we looked back with nostalgia. Much better to have the obscene opulence of Gbadolite, the city in the middle of nowhere, than the disaster that has been the Democratic Republic of Congo that followed the ousting of Mobutu. Likewise in Libya, better to have Muammar Gaddafi's Green Book of political pronouncements. Much better to have him crowned the King of Kings of Africa by traditional leaders and let him fund the African Union. And better surely to put up with his air-conditioned tents and long rambling speeches at the United Nations than the chaos that is today's Libya after he was overthrown. Mentioning Mobutu And if Obama had looked up the files just a few years back he would have found another US President, Bill Clinton, saying during his time that there was a ""new Africa"". Two leaders who were part of the new Africa of the Clinton years are now refusing to leave office in the Obama years. Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni used to be openly contemptuous of African leaders who cling to office. Next year, some 30 years after he marched into Kampala to chase out Milton Obote, he is proposing to stand for another term as president. Next door, an enthusiastic parliament has opened the path for Paul Kagame to stand for another term as president of Rwanda in case the great successes he has achieved are jeopardized by someone else taking his place. The West African leaders under the auspices of the regional body Ecowas (the Economic Community of West African States), tried to make a two-term limit for presidents binding on their members. They retreated quietly once Togo and The Gambia protested. I am told the unspoken answer these days to presidents not wanting to leave office in Africa is: ""DRC and Libya, or Mobutu and Gaddafi"".

"The pair announced the move in a joint statement on Wednesday on Twitter. ""After a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,"" the couple said in the statement. Amazon, formed 25 years ago, this week eclipsed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable listed company. Mr Bezos, 54, who founded Amazon, is the world's wealthiest man according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, with an estimated wealth of $137bn, some $45bn ahead of Bill Gates. The 48-year-old MacKenzie Bezos is a novelist, the author of The Testing of Luther Albright (2005) and Traps (2013). ""We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other,"" the couple's statement said. ""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again. We've had such a great life together as a married couple and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures. ""Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends."" Last year they launched a charity project together, the Day One Fund, with the aim of helping homeless families and building pre-schools in low-income communities. The couple have four children - three sons, and an adopted daughter. US media report that Mr Bezos has been romantically involved with a former Fox TV host, Lauren Sánchez. Entertainment news site TMZ, citing sources linked to Ms Sánchez, said the presenter has been ""seeing"" Mr Bezos as of late last year. In 2013, MacKenzie Bezos told Vogue Magazine that she had met Jeff when he interviewed her for a job at a hedge fund in New York. They got engaged after three months of dating and married shortly after, in 1993. One year later he founded Amazon - which began as an online book retailer. The company has since expanded into an e-commerce giant. Amazon was worth $797bn (£634bn) when the US stock market closed on Monday, after rising 3.4% and moving past Microsoft, valued at $789bn.","Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are to divorce after a 25-year marriage."
"The Protect Our Power campaign aims to stop such policies, which would disproportionately affect black voters. Republican legislatures have been advancing laws to limit where and when people can vote amid unproven allegations of election fraud in 2020. Georgia, a key state in the election, is at the centre of the rights battle. Other rights organisations have joined up with James' More Than A Vote group to focus on the issue in Georgia. In a video announcing the new campaign on Friday, James says: ""This isn't the time to put your feet up."" ""Posting hashtags and black squares"", he says, is not enough. ""It's always been more than a vote. It's a fight and it's just getting started."" Speaking over images of the January Capitol siege, he says: ""They saw what we're capable of, and they fear it"". The typically Republican state flipped during the 2020 presidential election, helping hand President Joe Biden his White House win. Voters there also delivered victory to two Democratic Senate candidates in January, giving Democrats a slim majority in the upper chamber of Congress. Republicans remain in control of Georgia's state government, however, and have now approved bills that would cut voter access. Measures include limiting the use of drop boxes to return ballots, requiring photo identification for voting by mail and cutting back early voting on weekends. Conservatives argue the ""common-sense"" restrictions are necessary to keep the electoral process fair. Advocates say these measures would disproportionately affect black voters, who are a third of voters in the state, especially as many church voting drives happen on Sundays. Other states led by Republicans have put forth similar measures. James launched More Than A Vote following national protests over the death of George Floyd last year. American football quarterback Patrick Mahomes, basketball star Jalen Rose and actor Kevin Hart are also members. The group aims to mobilise black voters and address criminal justice reform this year. James is expected to appear in an advert during the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday to promote the campaign.

"Both men are at a high security prison in Rio. They deny any wrongdoing. Mr Batista, once Brazil's richest man, has been accused of paying $16.5m (£13.2m) in bribes to Mr Cabral. As governor of Rio, Mr Cabral oversaw the construction of infrastructure for the 2014 football World Cup. Mr Batista was arrested last month on arrival from New York. He gave himself up to police and vowed to clear his name. ""I'm at the disposal of the courts,"" he told O Globo newspaper before boarding the plane to Rio. No university degree Mr Batista's lawyer told reporters his client would help investigators with all information about the charges. However he did not answer questions during a police interview last week. Who is Eike Batista? Mr Batista is one of Brazil's most famous businessmen and made a fortune in commodities over the past decades. It is reported that he lost virtually all of his mining empire, as projects that had been sold to investors failed to materialise. Under Brazilian law, Mr Batista would have been sent to a special prison wing if he had a university degree. But as he dropped out before finishing his engineering degree in Germany, he will be serving time in an ordinary cell with six other inmates at the Bangu penitentiary. Mr Cabral and his wife, lawyer Adriana Anselmo, are also at the Bangu jail, but on different wings. They were arrested last year but have not been charged. Twelve people in total were charged earlier on Wednesday. Among them are Mr Cabral's ex-wife and his brother. Prosecutors say Mr Cabral paid generous allowances to them with corruption money from Odebrecht, Brazil's biggest construction company. Odebrecht's CEO, Marcelo Odebrecht, is serving a 19-year prison sentence for money laundering and bribery involving Brazil's state oil company, Petrobras.","Brazilian prosecutors have charged the former billionaire tycoon, Eike Batista, and the former governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio Cabral, with involvement in a corruption ring."
"By Bethany BellBBC News The Fridays for Future environmental protests, championed by the teenage Swedish activist, have put climate change concerns centre-stage, days away from the European elections. The UK and Ireland have both declared a ""climate emergency"", responding to the protests. Last year saw Green parties win big in German local elections, where there is talk of a ""Green wave"". So will all this help Europe's Green parties in the vote? Munich, Germany Henrike Hahn, the German Green Party's top candidate in Bavaria, looked confident campaigning at a farmers' market in Munich. ""Our core message is courage instead of fear,"" she said. In Bavaria the Greens are riding high. In state elections last year, they surged into second place with over 17% and they hope for a similar result in the EU elections. ""The Conservative CSU Party in Bavaria, which has been in power for decades, was focusing on anti-European politics and anti-refugee feeling,"" she said. ""We realised people don't want to be scared. They want political content. And what we focus on is, of course, strong policies on climate issues, on environmental protection, but also core values like pro-European humanity and solidarity with refugees."" At the farmer's market, the Green message seemed to go down well. ""I'm really disappointed with the established parties,"" one man said. ""For once, I may make an exception and vote Green."" Lore Becker, a pensioner who teaches English, said Green policies represented the future. ""I think they're absolutely important for all of Europe, not only Germany. The Greens, it seems to me, are a party of the younger generation and not only the old topics that we are a little bit tired of."" But some Germans see the Greens as puritanical. Daniel Günther, the conservative Prime Minister of Schleswig-Holstein in the north, told German daily Die Zeit: ""Those who try to regiment everything in life: no motor racing, or better still, no cars at all, no more fast food - they also diminish the joy of life. And some Greens go too far in that direction."" Read more on the European elections: Vienna, Austria Over the border in Austria, the Green Party is struggling to make a comeback after it failed to cross the 4% threshold and crashed out of parliament in the 2017 general election. Political analyst Thomas Hofer said it had been brought down by ""a lot of internal quarrels, one party branch against the other"". ""This really destroyed their chances of getting back into parliament. Of course, this was also due to a hostile environment because, back in 2017, there was one overarching issue, migration, and the Greens were perceived as being too lenient on that,"" he said. But Mr Hofer believes the Greens can stage a comeback in the EU elections, and score around 8–9%. ""I think there are a lot of former Green voters who regret that they went away in 2017. I'm pretty sure that the Greens won't keep their great result from 2014, but I think they will come in the high single digits."" The Greens have enlisted a celebrity chef, Sarah Wiener, as one of their candidates. At a campaign event, Dagmar, from Vienna, considered the Greens to be the only party with a global outlook. ""It's important for Europe, I think. They care for global health because we can't do immigration, we can't do financial things, social things, without being supported by what we live from: plants, animals, water. ""If you have children, you have to think about that."" Padua, Italy A little further south, in Italy, the picture is very different. A coalition called Europa Verde is polling at about 1%. In Padua I met Giovanni, a student of ecology. He says political support for Green issues is very weak in Italy. ""I think people here love the landscape, which is very beautiful, and they want to preserve it, but maybe they don't know how. ""We are getting a little distracted with other things.""

Allegations of physical abuse made by former residents against some former staff there have been denied. Mr McKeon said he only ever saw one incident where a teacher pushed a pupil against a wall. Mr McKeon, who founded Les Chenes in the 1970s and worked there for ten years, said he had reprimanded the member of staff at the time and warned him such behaviour risked assault charges. He moved on to other education jobs in the 1980s, then was head of education in Jersey from 1997 until he retired in 2007. Les Chenes closed in 2003.

"The leak at the site, owned by South Korean company LG Chem, occurred early on Thursday morning in the city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh state. Hundreds were taken ill and rushed to hospital, while thousands were evacuated from surrounding villages. The dead include four women, two children, both girls, and five men. Officials said most of those who were admitted to hospital on Thursday have since been discharged. Some 120 people are still being treated, but are stable. The leak happened as the plant was being re-opened for the first time since 24 March, when India went into lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. The company said in a statement that it was investigating the cause of the incident, and was looking at ways ""to provide speedy treatment"" for those affected. The cause of the leak is still unclear and investigation is underway, officials said. But the charges against the company include causing death by negligence. ""There is no more leakage happening, but the smell remains. It perhaps will linger for some more time,"" the city's deputy police commissioner, Gautam Sawang, told BBC Telugu. People living near the plant say they woke up in the early hours to the smell of the gas and fled their homes. They were taken to hospital, complaining of a burning sensation in the eyes and difficulties breathing. The fumes had spread over a radius of about 3km (2 miles). Distressing images of people fainting and dropping unconscious on the streets were shared on social media. India has a tragic history of gas leaks. In 1984, a toxic chemical leak in a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal killed thousands of people, in what is acknowledged to be the world's worst industrial disaster. More than 35 years later, victims say children are still being born with disabilities because of the effects of the methyl isocyanate gas spill. What is Styrene and how can exposure affect humans?

"The so-called Camp Fire, which started early on Thursday near Camp Creek, has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest. Some residents in the town of Paradise, which was ""devastated"", were trapped by the flames, state fire officials said. Thousands in the region have evacuated, including from schools and hospitals. There are unconfirmed reports of casualties, which an official said could take days to confirm. ""[Paradise] is devastated, everything is destroyed. There's nothing left standing,"" said Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman. The Camp Fire had burned through 20,000 acres as of Thursday afternoon, local time, according to California Fire officials. As winds approached 50mph (80km/h), causing the fire to grow rapidly in just a few hours, some residents were forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot, local media reported. Further south in Ventura County near Los Angeles, strong winds are preventing efforts to tackle another massive blaze - a few miles from the scene of a mass shooting in Thousands Oaks that claimed 12 lives on Wednesday. The second wildfire is said to have scorched 10,000 acres, according to officials. Evacuation orders are in place in northern California for the town of Paradise, home to around 26,000 people, as well as Magalia, Concow, Butte Creek Canyon and Butte Valley areas. Emergency crews are working to rescue residents trapped there, an official said. At least one nursing home and the Feather River Hospital were evacuated and several homes were on fire, according to the Sacramento Bee, and the region is covered with thick, dark smoke. A spokesman for the hospital operator, Dignity Health, reportedly told Action News Now that Feather River was later destroyed. Thousands are also without power in the region, which is just north of Sacramento. One Paradise resident who fled the encroaching blaze told the Bee: ""It was so hot. You could feel it."" Others described watching flames consume their property as they evacuated. The blaze is one of 14 currently active in California. Officials have put most of Northern California is under a Red Flag Warning, which means ""extreme fire behaviour"" can occur within 24 hours. On social media, many have been sharing images of highways and roads flanked by fire or covered in heavy smoke and asking for help to evacuate friends and family. Resident Shari Bernacett told the Associated Press that she ""knocked on doors, yelled and screamed"" to get mobile home residents to leave as fire consumed the hillside. ""The whole hill's on fire,"" she said while crying. ""God help us!"" The region has grappled with serious wildfires - including the worst in the state's history, the Mendocino and Thomas fires - on and off since 2017.","A fierce wildfire racing across Northern California has destroyed parts of the Sierra foothills, including one town, officials say."
"Relations between India and the US have been rocky in recent months. It is Mr Kerry's first visit to Delhi since a row between the two countries over the arrest and brief jailing of an Indian diplomat in New York. Devyani Khobragade, an official in the New York consulate, was arrested in December on a visa fraud charge after she was accused of underpaying her housekeeper and lying about it on immigration forms. She later left the US. India has also raised concerns over reports that the US spied on global leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In their public pronouncements, both Mr Kerry and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj sounded confident about improving ties in the near future. ""The moment has never been more ripe to deliver on the incredible possibilities in the relationship between our two nations,"" Mr Kerry said. The two countries were at ""an important turning point"" and they shared ""converging long-term strategic interests"", Ms Swaraj added. But papers feel that Delhi and Washington have much work to do to ""realise the full potential"" of the bilateral ties. The talks ""were overshadowed by a dispute over India's opposition to a world trade pact and a new expression of Indian irritation over US surveillance activity"", The Economic Times reports. India has repeatedly stalled a WTO deal, disappointing US officials. The Trade Facilitation Agreement to streamline global customs procedures should have been finalised in July, but it has been blocked over a number of rifts, including India's demands for concessions on the stockpiling of food. The First Post website says that ""fresh rifts over trade and spying cast a shadow"" on bilateral ties. The DNA website echoes similar views, saying though the two countries stressed their desire to boost business and defence ties, ""trade and spying rows were a reminder of the obstacles to President Barack Obama's vision of a 'defining' partnership"". 'E-rickshaw ban' Meanwhile, a court has ordered the Delhi government to stop battery-operated e-rickshaws from the capital's roads. The court has asked the government ""to form a policy guideline on e-rickshaws, the CNN-IBN website reports. The court order came after a child's death earlier in the week was blamed on ""reckless driving"" by an e-rickshaw driver. ""A three-year-old boy fell into a huge pot of boiling sugar syrup after being hit by a speeding e-rickshaw,"" the report says. ""As far as the present situation is concerned, the plying of e-rickshaws is illegal. Delhi government must ban plying of e-rickshaws without fail. Unregulated plying of these vehicles on roads of Delhi prima facie is hazardous to other traffic as well as to citizens,"" The Times of India quotes the court as saying. The court was hearing a petition filed by social worker Shanawaz Khan. ""While they operate on a power output of 650-850 watts and are designed to ferry only four people, they routinely carry up to 8-10 persons, endangering lives,"" Mr Khan said.

"The man's name and the circumstances of his abduction in January 2014 remain unknown. He was handed over to the members of the International Red Cross and the Catholic Church in a remote area of Norte de Santander province. The ELN is Colombia's second largest group, after the Farc. Dutch authorities had been involved in the negotiations to free the man, who is said to be 52 years old, according to Dutch media. But local Colombian police said they were not aware that the man was being held hostage, El Tiempo newspaper reported. The ELN, or National Liberation Army, announced last year that it was willing to enter peace negotiations with the Colombian government.

"By Saira AsherBBC News Last week the hugely popular live music TV show Coke Studio reworked a beloved classic Ko Ko Korina, considered the first true pop song in Pakistan. The video was posted on YouTube and it was at that point we all found out how angry this had made people. Rage usually reserved only for religion, politics and cricket came down upon the Ko Ko Korina cover - with a vengeance. Things became truly surreal when Pakistan's Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari weighed in to describe it as a ""massacre"" of the classic song, questioning how producers had allowed this to happen. The singers -pop sensation Mohmina Mustehsan and up-and-coming actor Ahad Raza Mir - did not take the criticism lying down. He challenged the minister for her use of the word ""massacre"" and Mohmina drew inspiration from Uncle Ben from Spiderman to advise: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" So then obviously the Pakistani internet let rip with the inevitable Spiderman memes and bleeding ear jokes. It also became an extended joke that cut very close to the bone with its debate about human rights - some declared the minister had a right to weigh in because the song was so bad it was itself a rights violation, but others pointed out the irony of the minster focusing on a song when there were more troubling issues in the country. Ms Mazari, newly installed in the job, defended herself saying she had a right to her opinion and the issue had nothing to do with the human rights ministry, garnering support from many. One of those who joined the debate was Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a politician murdered because he opposed Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws. His killer continued to be celebrated by many right up to his execution - with hardly any official figures condemning that. Mr Taseer was himself held captive for almost five years by militants. In Pakistan humour is often used to make the horrors of daily life more bearable. So Pakistan has sincerely engaged in a heated debate about human rights - and it's all over a cover song. For those who didn't grow up in a Pakistani household, the song itself is instantly recognisable and loved. It's sung at weddings and when young people get together for singalongs. It was released in 1966 during the golden age of Pakistani cinema - part of the soundtrack of the film Armaan, starring the absolutely unrivalled romantic hero of the time Waheed Murad. The lyrics are a man singing about his ideal woman. The chorus - where the phrase Ko Ko Korina is repeated - doesn't really mean anything. But just as with most pop songs the melody is simple, catchy and easy to sing along to. It was unconventional for its time, a turn away from the classical eastern music of the region, and has since been remade several times keeping it relevant for all ages. ""It's not just a bit of nostalgia, it's an inflection point in our cultural history,"" says Fasi Zaka, a columnist and commentator. So to give you an idea of the scale of the offence - Rafay Mahmood, cultural journalist at the Express Tribune newspaper, said it was as if Ed Sheeran had covered Queen's classic Bohemian Rhapsody and botched it. One of the strongest complaints is the overly choreographed nature of the performance. ""The kind of clothes they are wearing, they way they are acting, their antics; they seem too pretentious. It's as if they are trying to pull off a retro act or feel,"" says Mr Mahmood. Coke Studio made a name for itself bringing together folk musicians with modern singers in collaborations that have been hugely popular - redefining music for a new generation. ""Over the years there's been a feeling of an auteur-led effort into music, bringing a sheen to our historical legacy. But this one seems inauthentic,"" says Mr Zaka. Other people have said it sounds amateur and that the pair are just simply not very good singers. But what started off as artistic critique has turned into something much darker. Mohmina, a singer-songwriter, has had a meteoric rise. Last year she was the nation's sweetheart, but after some controversial statements on social media she's become a target for some. Ahad Raza Mir is also known for his good looks - not singing talent. But the response to their performance has descended into personal attacks. ""It's no longer about music. It's about how badly can you hate Mohmina and Ahad Raza Mir,"" says Mr Mahmood. Both performers have addressed the intense backlash, with Ahad Raza Mir asking for more kindness, even when doling out criticism. ""If we can come together to hate something, we can do the same to love."" But there's something else going on here. There's huge pressure for music coming out of Pakistan to live up to a high standard because it's become intrinsically tied up with its international image. Music, and specifically the success of Coke Studio Pakistan, has shown ""we are peace loving people, we are the land of the Sufis, the land of the melodies"", says Mr Mahmood. When pressed, most people begrudgingly admit the cover isn't terrible, it's just ""meh"", ""ho hum"" or ""subpar"". But that combined with the people involved and the history of the TV show have created a maelstorm of rage, or perhaps as Mr Mahmood put it: ""I think we have a lot of free time and we love music.""","There are a lot of bad cover versions of songs but few have caused the kind of uproar seen in Pakistan this week, drawing in a government minister, a pop sweetheart and even Spiderman."
"But an online challenge encouraging users to clean up places has seen tens of thousands of people doing just that. In the Trashtag Challenge, users pick a place filled with litter, clean it up, and post before and after pictures. Volunteers have made beaches, parks and roads trash-free while also raising awareness of the quantity of plastic litter we produce. This group in Novosibirsk, Russia, said they had collected 223 bags of litter, 75% of which would be sent for recycling. The challenge was reportedly created in 2015 by outdoor company UCO Gear as part of a campaign to protect wilderness areas. But a Facebook post last week directed at ""tired teens"" has apparently given it new life and made the hashtag viral. On Instagram alone, there were more than 25,000 posts with the hashtag #trashtag - variations include #trashtagchallenge and #trashchallenge. In Spanish, it has been translated to #BasuraChallenge. But where does it go from here? ""Getting plastic out of the environment is important,"" Mark Butler, policy director of the Canadian environmental charity Ecology Action Centre (EAC) told Halifax's Star newspaper. ""We need to do more than go behind the people that are littering and clean it up. We need to turn off the plastic tap,"" he said, adding that he hoped the campaign would lead to fundamental changes over single-use plastics, for example. ""There's the waste hierarchy, which is to refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle. If we don't do that stuff, then all we'll be doing is cleaning up the litter with no end in sight.""

"By Greg DunlopBBC News, Sydney But Clive Palmer, who retired from politics last year, is seizing attention again - this time with poetry. His verses, which he posts on social media, have been prolific in recent weeks. They are brief and at times bewildering, just as some described his parliamentary stint. So how does Mr Palmer explain it? ""Poetry doesn't really have a meaning,"" he told Fairfax Media. The famously large man attributed his creativity in part to a recent diet. ""When you're on diet you think about food a lot, and poetry sort of comes from within you."" His compositions have amused - and confused - his more than 70,000 followers. One newspaper columnist wrote: ""No, we don't know what it means, and neither does Clive."" Another speculated: ""Maybe he's gunning for a new career as Australia's edgiest poet."" The poems have been read by YouTube comedian Lewis Spears, who joked Mr Palmer was ""a modern Shakespeare"". They will also be recorded by an electronic music duo, Peking Duk. Mr Palmer is not the first Australian mining magnate to gain attention for poetry. Australia's richest woman, Gina Rinehart, once wrote a critically derided poem titled ""Our Future"", which was later fixed to an iron ore boulder. Who is Clive Palmer? ""Wordsworth talked about poetry being the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings, and I think in Clive's case the origin of poetry comes from a spontaneous overflow of hunger,"" said Associate Prof Bronwyn Lea, who teaches poetry at the University of Queensland. ""But I think it has its own kind of joie de vivre."" Although the poems ""don't display a good deal of skill or attention"", Prof Lea suggested frequent mentions of ""Moondog"" and ""Mockingbird"" could be references to two famous Americans - poet Louis Thomas Hardin and novelist Harper Lee. ""It's a little bit in the tradition of Yoko Ono and her 'action-poems' which were popular in the 1960s, smashed up with a recipe,"" she told the BBC. ""But that would be reading a lot into it."" In 2015, Mr Palmer was invited to the Queensland Poetry Festival to read from a self-published book of love poetry he wrote in the 1980s. He has also revealed his favourite writers include Robert Frost, TS Elliot and William Shakespeare. ""I'd encourage him to continue reading those poets as well as to read broadly among contemporary Australian poets,"" Prof Lea said.","He is the Australian mining tycoon who opened a dinosaur theme park, vowed to build a replica Titanic, and spent three years as a maverick MP."
"By Guy DelauneyBBC News, Belgrade This was not just any rail journey. It would have been the first direct train in almost two decades between Serbia's capital, Belgrade, and North Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo with a large ethnic-Serb population. ""[Ethnic] Albanians showed they want war,"" said Mr Nikolic. For his part, Kosovo's president, Hashim Thaci, accused Serbia of ""provoking"" Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian majority, in an attempt to replicate what he called ""the Crimea model"" by taking control of northern Kosovo. Instead of promoting freedom of movement, the North Mitrovica train affair is threatening to derail an EU-mediated process that has seen the two sides reach agreements on everything from judicial structures to, last month, a long-awaited international telephone dialling code for Kosovo. But the Serbian authorities chose to mark the train's launch with a special livery. Inside, paintings of Orthodox saints; outside, the slogan ""Kosovo is Serbia"" in 21 different languages. More on this story: The authorities in Pristina duly took the bait and sent police to prevent the service entering Kosovo. The train stopped well before it got there, but it had gone far enough to allow politicians on both sides to voice their outrage. On many levels, this is a concocted controversy. Belgrade and North Mitrovica have long had direct transport links through several daily bus services. In fact, they make the journey in around half the time of the proposed train timetable. And it is no secret that ""Kosovo is Serbia"" is Serbian government policy. It is supported in this assertion not just by Russia, as is usually mentioned in media reports, but a diverse array of more than 80 UN member states, including Spain, Brazil, India and Nigeria. All of them refuse to recognise the unilateral declaration of independence which Kosovo made in 2008. Tensions escalated earlier this month when former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj was arrested on a Serbian war crimes warrant. He was eventually released but Kosovo saw his detention as a diplomatic provocation. Haradinaj freed after French inquiry Cynics might suggest that the timing of this kerfuffle could be connected to the Serbian presidential election in April, in which Mr Nikolic will face a challenge from unapologetic ultra-nationalist, Vojislav Seselj. There may also be an element of Belgrade highlighting its complaint that Pristina is not doing enough to implement its side of the 2013 Brussels Agreement aimed at normalising relations. In Kosovo, the shenanigans could be viewed as a welcome distraction for political leaders who fear they may become embroiled in a new war crimes tribunal, which aims to prosecute alleged atrocities by the Kosovo Liberation Army in the late 1990s. The US has unsurprisingly taken Kosovo's side and Russia, equally predictably, supports Serbia. The EU has simply urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep talking. And Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic has said he wants to set up a hotline to his Kosovo counterparts and steer relations to calmer waters. As Serbia's EU membership negotiations depend on this, perhaps normal service will soon be resumed, even if that does not apply to the North Mitrovica line.","The new train service could have been a celebration of warming relations between Serbia and Kosovo. But instead, in the words of Serbia's president, Tomislav Nikolic, it brought them to ""the brink of conflict""."
"The application to demolish and rebuild the school has been filed with the Environment Department. Education Minister Carol Steere said she was confident the States would back the plans and hoped that they would go to the States early next year. She said her department wanted to ensure ""quality and value for money"" in the build. Deputy Steere said they had delivered four projects recently that were ""all on time and on budget"". Despite the tough economic climate the States has classed the rebuild as a priority and money has already been earmarked. Les Beaucamps was built in the late 1950s and currently has more than 500 pupils.","Guernsey could spend £35m on a new secondary school to replace Les Beaucamps, if planners give permission."
"The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill has been proposed, after three people were convicted of election fraud in 2012. In a trial at Douglas court house the trio were found guilty of manipulating the Isle of Man's proxy voting system during a by-election in 2010. A government spokesman said the updated laws included proxy vote restrictions. Declare funding He added: ""The Bill replaces the term 'absent voting' with 'advance voting' to make it clearer that this option is open to any elector, regardless of their ability to attend a polling station on polling day. ""It restricts the availability of 'proxy' voting to those who cannot vote in person or by advance vote"". The law update comes after an independent review, promoted by the outcome of the election trial in 2012. The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill would also mean each political candidate would have to publicly declare all campaign funding. All anonymous donations would have to be refused and a limit would be placed on how much each candidate could spend on the campaign. An eight-week consultation was launched on Wednesday.","Law changes will bring more ""transparency and integrity"" to island elections, the Manx government claims."
"By Anbarasan Ethirajan BBC News, Dhaka More than 200 houses inside the enclave were burnt down. Residents reportedly refused to return the body of a Bangladeshi villager allegedly killed by the Indians. The Indian enclave, Garati, is situated inside Bangladesh, about 3.5km (two miles) from the border which is not properly demarcated. About 2,000 people live in the enclave, which is surrounded by the Bangladeshi district of Panchagarh. Tense relations Indians allege that the intruder from Bangladesh was a robber but villagers from the neighbouring area deny the accusations. Reports say only half the population of the enclave has returned to the area so far. Hundreds of people have spent the last few nights out in the open as their homes were destroyed in the violence. Residents of the enclave say they had lost household goods and valuables in the mob attack. ""Normalcy is slowly returning to the area. We have deployed additional forces to prevent further violence,"" Shahriar Rahman, a senior police official in the district of Panchagarh, told the BBC Bengali service. There has been no comment yet from the Indian side on the incident. Local journalists say this is the first major attack on an Indian enclave in many years. The incident has once again highlighted the tense relations in the border areas. India and Bangladesh have enclaves in each other's territory and the two sides have been holding talks for years to resolve all border-related issues. The two countries share a border of more than 4,100km (2,550 miles). There are more than 100 Indian enclaves inside Bangladeshi territory and there are about 50 Bangladeshi enclaves in India - thousands of people live in them. Residents of these enclaves often complain that there is virtually no infrastructure and no government. They say there is a lack of water, roads, electricity, schools and medicine. Activists say neither government is seriously interested in addressing the plight of people living in the enclaves.",Police in Bangladesh say they have arrested 11 people over an arson attack on a village in an Indian enclave inside Bangladeshi territory.
"John SimpsonWorld affairs editor But even if the ceasefire holds and the peace talks bear fruit, there is a long, long way to go before the chaos there can be sorted out. Libya is a deeply disturbing country at present. It has all the signs of a failed state. Under Colonel Gaddafi, Libya was a scared, unnaturally poor country whose huge oil wealth had been squandered by its leaders. But at least it was peaceful. As a Westerner, you were perfectly safe there. Hopes for peace ""The ghost of Muammar Gaddafi will always haunt us."" In the lobby of a five-star hotel in Tripoli, a Libyan friend of mine who had worked closely with Gaddafi spoke the words softly to me. Within a matter of weeks Gaddafi was dead. Now, said people like my friend, we can build a decent country again. That was more than three years ago. On the face of it, Gaddafi has already been forgotten. The bullet-splattered images of his absurdly smiling face on concrete display-boards at major crossroads throughout the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahuriyah have disappeared. The SPLAJ is history. Gaddafi was ludicrous, utterly corrupt and personally degenerate; though Tony Blair, for Britain, and Nicolas Sarkozy, for France, were among those who were prepared to ignore all this and cosy up to him for the sake of Libya's oil wealth. But Gaddafi had ruled the country in his addled way for more than 40 years, and had deeply affected the life of every single Libyan throughout that time. You don't just kill a dictator like that, destroy his portraits, and put him behind you. At first, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, there was political upheaval and some violence. The hostility of provincial areas like Zintan, Misurata and Benghazi towards Tripoli was worrying, but it seemed reasonable to hope that things would settle down. In July 2012, elections were held. They weren't altogether smooth, but there was a clear result: the moderate National Forces Alliance won almost half the seats. A government was formed. But the armed groups which had fought the Gaddafi loyalists in the civil war hadn't gone away. Their roadblocks made driving round Libya hazardous, and when they clashed there was trouble. Extremism was on the rise. Ambassador murdered On 11 September 2012 - the date was significant - Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya was murdered, together with three others, at the US mission in Benghazi. Although the Islamic extremist group, Ansar al-Sharia, avoided claiming sole responsibility, vehicles with Ansar's logo on them were spotted at the mission during the attack. Last June, American special forces captured a leading figure in Ansar, Ahmad Abu Khattala (who had denied being involved), and took him to the US for trial. In the wake of the attack on the US mission, big demonstrations in Benghazi demanded an end to the actions of the militias, and Ansar's headquarters were stormed and ransacked. But it didn't stop Ansar in the long run. Last July, it took complete control of Benghazi, and has a strong presence in the eastern town of Derna. Islamist front-line Libya is not only violent and deeply divided, therefore; it has become another front line in the battle between extreme Islamism and the rest of the world. This certainly wasn't the outcome Nato expected when Britain and France started bombing Gaddafi's forces in 2011. So were they wrong to get involved? The French and British air forces intervened to protect the largely unarmed insurgents of Benghazi from the advance of Gaddafi's tanks. If the tanks had re-conquered Benghazi, Gaddafi might still be in power, and Libya would be a quieter place. But Gaddafi's rule, which lasted 42 years, was certain to collapse at some point. In that way it was similar to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The choice wasn't between the continuation of a quiet, safe, if unpleasant regime and the chaos that exists today; it was a question of when the system fell, and whether the aftermath could be controlled. Depressingly, Libya may still have plenty of violence to go through before it can become peaceful again: assuming it doesn't break up into three or four mutually hostile parts. In Iraq, you often hear people say they wish Saddam was still in power. That instinct is rarer in Libya, but it certainly exists. It is Gaddafi's revenge on the people who overthrew him. Correction 19:44 20 January 2015: This piece has been amended to correct a number of errors about flights and transport links to Libya, and remove an incorrect reference to foreigners requiring the assistance of armed groups to travel around the country. It also incorrectly stated that Ansar al-Sharia formally gave its allegiance to IS.","The partial ceasefire announced by the Libyan army on Sunday, following peace talks with various factions in Geneva, is the first good news to come out of Libya for months."
"Poland saw new cases jump by 21,897 on Saturday, and Hungary saw a record daily increase of 3,908. Meanwhile Austria's chancellor announced new lockdown measures including a curfew from 20:00 to 06:00. Slovakia is testing everyone over the age of 10 to try to stop the spread of the disease there. The project to test four million people in the country, where infections have soared, is expected to last over two weekends. What's the situation in central Europe? Much of Europe is battling with soaring infection rates, with several countries reinstating lockdowns or partial lockdowns to try to stem the wave. Poland saw cases go up for a fifth day in a row, with Covid-19 patients occupying 16,144 hospital beds - 1,305 of them on ventilators - according to the Polish health ministry. There were 280 new deaths. The rise comes as protesters against last week's near-total ban on abortion continue to defy government calls to stay at home due to rising infections. The country already has the highest level of restrictions to date, with public gatherings banned, most schools closed and restaurants and cafes only offering take-away service. Last week, Polish President Andrzej Duda, 48, tested positive for the virus, but experienced no symptoms. As of Saturday, Poland had 340,834 total cases, with 5,351 deaths according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Deaths from Covid-19 in Hungary rose by 51, bringing the total to 1,750, the government said on Saturday. It also said the number of Covid patients in hospital had exceeded 4,000 for the first time. Hungary has yet to impose restrictions on mass events, with schools and shops remaining open and football matches operating throughout the pandemic. However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in a radio interview on Friday that authorities would hand out fines to anyone failing to wear a mask where required. As of Saturday, Hungary had 71,413 total cases, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced new restrictions including a curfew from 20:00 to 06:00 and the closure of cafes and restaurants except for takeaway service. He said that shops would remain open. The restrictions, which will come into force on Tuesday, comes as infections approach a level which officials say will stretch the country's hospitals beyond capacity. Austria saw 5,349 cases on Saturday, slightly down from Friday's record high of 5,627. What's happening elsewhere in Europe? UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces a four-week lockdown for England starting on Thursday, with non-essential shops and hospitality closing but schools, colleges and universities remaining open Portugal is to begin a new partial lockdown on Wednesday, with about 70% of the population - including the Lisbon and Porto regions - affected by stay-at-home rules Greece announces a partial lockdown, with restaurants and other leisure activities closed in major Greek cities from Tuesday. ""We must act now, before intensive care units buckle under the strain of lives in danger,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Saturday. Greece has not seen as many cases as other parts of Europe, but there has been a steady increase since early October Belgium has announced a return to a national lockdown from Monday, as latest coronavirus figures show it has the highest infection rate in Europe. It means non-essential shops and businesses offering personal services like hair salons will be closed until mid-December. The country has more than half of its 2,000 intensive care unit beds already occupied by Covid-19 patients France last week entered into a new national lockdown that will last a month, with schools and workplaces remaining open but people requiring permits to leave home.","Hungary and Poland are the latest countries to see record daily coronavirus cases, as Europe grapples with a second wave."
"By Heather ChenBBC News, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia Judge Nenney Shushaidah presides over five trials a day and can hear up to 80 cases a week. Malaysia practises a moderate form of Islam but conservative attitudes have been on the rise and the use of Sharia is growing as well. Under a dual-track legal system, thousands of Muslims use it to settle moral and family matters. Non-Muslims are required to follow secular laws that deal with the same matters. She passes judgment on everything from financial cases to those involving the Sharia concept of Khalwat [unmarried Muslim couples being caught in compromising situations]. But her expertise lies in child custody and cases of polygamy - the Muslim concept of allowing men to marry up to four wives, which is legal in Malaysia. Judge Shushaidah says there are many factors she considers before, for example, allowing a polygamous union. ""Every case is complex and different,"" she explained. ""You can't generalise Islamic law and say it favours men and treats women badly... I want to correct that misconception."" All those involved in a proposed polygamous marriage are required to be physically present in Judge Shushaidah's court. ""I want to hear from everyone, not just [the] men,"" she said. ""I make it a point to speak with women to find out if they are on board with the arrangement. It is important that they agree to it because if I see any signs that say otherwise then I won't grant permission."" ""I am female and I can understand most women would not like the idea. But it is allowed under Islam, and our Malaysian courts have enacted strict laws to govern this."" ""A man has to have very strong reasons for wanting another marriage,"" she said. ""He must show he can look after the welfare of his first wife as well as the women who come after. He is not allowed to neglect the needs of anyone."" Judge Shushaidah added that some wives can be supportive of the idea. She recalls, for example, a case which involved a seriously ill woman who could no longer bear children. ""She loved her husband and wanted me to grant him permission to marry a second wife. So I did."" What is Sharia? Background on Sharia law (BBC religion) How is Sharia law applied? She defends her religion's reputation for strict laws by arguing that it is capable of fairness. But critics and rights groups argue Sharia is often misused. ""We have no objection to Sharia law that doesn't discriminate against women, gay people or social and religious minorities,"" Asia deputy director of Human Rights Watch Phil Robertson told BBC 100 Women. ""But the problem with Sharia law in Malaysia is that too often it does precisely that. ""Religion is never an acceptable reason to violate international human rights standards of equality and non-discrimination."" For example rights activists were outraged by the recent caning of two Malaysian women convicted of attempting to have lesbian sex, and say Sharia law was misused in this case. Judge Shushaidah would not address the case, but said: ""Caning under Sharia law serves to educate offenders so as not to repeat the act again."" Judge Shushaidah also argues that Sharia does not always rule in favour of men. ""Our law exists to protect women's rights. It looks at their welfare and safeguards their livelihoods,"" she said. ""Islam holds women in high regard and as judges, we must return to its teachings and maintain worthiness using Sharia."" Her greatest concern lies with Muslim men bypassing strict Sharia court procedures by marrying overseas. ""He wouldn't be bound by Malaysian law if he marries abroad. Some wives actually consent to this to protect their husbands but they don't realise how it works against them,"" she said. ""Our Sharia laws are in place to protect the interests of women and hold men accountable."" Women's groups like Sisters in Islam highlighted a ""severe shortage of female representation"" in the courts and a ""strong sense of patriarchy"" in the overall system. ""The Sharia legal context in Malaysia not only selectively discriminates against women, it vilifies them as the cause of social immoralities,"" said spokeswoman Majidah Hashim. ""State Islamic institutions... have done little to ensure women are accorded due justice. In fact, the recent prosecution of women under Sharia law clearly shows that their voices are alarmingly silenced and access to justice is worryingly stifled."" This makes Judge Shushaidah's appointment a particularly significant one. ""Back in my day, most Sharia judges were men who questioned the need for women in the practice,"" said Judge Shushaidah. ""I never dreamed of becoming a judge,"" she admitted. ""As a lawyer, I didn't know if I could take on such a senior role that dealt with complicated cases. And as a woman, I felt doubt and fear."" ""Sometimes I do feel uneasy. As a woman, I must feel, and I'd be lying if I said I felt nothing. But I am a judge and I have to make sure I am always clear and objective. So in my judgment, I try and address this. I make do with the best evidence I get in court."" What is 100 Women?

"A CIA internal watchdog has been tasked with determining if the agency accessed the computers of Senate staff. The Senate committee was tasked with investigating potential past CIA abuse at the time of the alleged breach. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee called the reports, if true, an ""extremely serious matter"". 'Spurious allegations' Senate intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told US media that CIA inspector general David Buckley was looking into officer actions. The alleged improper monitoring is said to have taken place as the committee investigated allegations of CIA abuse stemming from a detention and interrogation programme in use under former US President George W Bush. Ms Feinstein has told US media in the past that the committee's 6,000 page ""comprehensive review"", completed in 2013, found the CIA programme yielded little or no significant intelligence. The New York Times initially reported the allegations of CIA monitoring of Senate computer networks, citing an anonymous official. ""Such activity, if it occurred as alleged, would impede Congress' ability to carry out its constitutional oversight responsibilities and could violate federal law,"" chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Carl Levin wrote in a statement on Wednesday. CIA director John Brennan reacted swiftly to the Senate allegations on Wednesday. ""I am deeply dismayed that some members of the Senate have decided to make spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts,"" he said. ""I am very confident that the appropriate authorities reviewing this matter will determine where wrongdoing, if any, occurred in either the Executive Branch or Legislative Branch.""",The Central Intelligence Agency is investigating allegations it improperly monitored members of the US Senate intelligence committee.

"The father was the only survivor of the blaze that engulfed the wooden house in the city of Clinton. He was taken to a hospital suffering from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns. The cause of the fire is being investigated. Local officials said there was no suspicion of ""foul play"", and told US media an electrical failure could have caused the blaze. The house in Clinton, some 10 miles (16km) from the state capital, Jackson, had been built around 1951. Burglar bars could be seen in some windows, which could have prevented the family from escaping. The mother was a primary school teacher aged 33 and the children - five boys and one girl - ranged in ages from one to 15, local authorities said. ""They were really good folks... The whole neighbourhood is just distraught about this whole thing because it's just devastating,"" a neighbour quoted by NBC News said. Five of the children were found huddled in one bedroom while the mother and another child were in a different bedroom, Fire Chief Jeff Blackledge was quoted by the New York Times as saying. The father was injured as he tried to save his family, he said. It took firefighters about 40 minutes to control the blaze that happened at 00:30 local time (06:30 GMT). When they arrived at the scene, they found the father ""worried and concerned"", said Mark Jones, City of Clinton's director of communications. ""He didn't want to leave the scene... He was very concerned about his family."" On Facebook, the City of Clinton said it had been a ""tragic day"", adding: ""We ask this community to wrap each other in prayers and kindness as we all grieve together.""","A mother and her six children, including a one-year-old baby, died after a fire destroyed their house early on Saturday in the US state of Mississippi, officials say."
"The tighter controls come after authorities foiled an alleged terror plot to bring down a plane leaving Sydney Airport in July. Australian baggage handlers and airport staff working in restricted zones will now be subject to random tests for traces of explosives. Inspections will also be carried out on employees' belongings and vehicles. The changes follow concerns raised by union and intelligence experts about the screening of staff, many of whom are on casual contracts. ""These measures strengthen existing controls to ensure airport workers are authorised, properly identified and appropriately trained before entering secure airside areas,"" Transport Minister Darren Chester said. The government said about 140,000 workers had access to secure zones in airports. One senator, Nick Xenophon, said Australia should adopt even stricter measures, such as a US-style system of mandatory checks for all staff.

"The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 that the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) is unconstitutional. The act denies legally married gay couples federal benefits including the ability to file joint tax returns. A Boston court unanimously ruled against Doma in May. The Supreme Court is expected to consider it next year. Only it can issue final rulings on whether laws passed by the US Congress are constitutional or not. In 2011, President Barack Obama instructed the Department of Justice not to defend the law, and earlier this year he announced that he supported the right of gays to marry. Equal protection clause The New York ruling came in a case brought by Edith Windsor, who sued the government in 2010 after being told to pay $363,053 (£224,940) in federal estate tax after her wife died. The couple had been partners for 44 years and had married in Canada in 2007. The majority opinion, written by Judge Dennis Jacobs, said that Doma's ""classification of same-sex spouses was not substantially related to an important government interest"" and therefore violated the equal protection clause of the US Constitution. Doma touches more than 1,000 federal laws, Judge Jacobs said, arguing that ""homosexuals are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public"". He also rejected arguments that the definition of marriage was traditional. ""Even if preserving tradition were in itself an important goal, Doma is not a means to achieve it."" In his dissent, Judge Chester Straub said that the government could only change its understanding of marriage if the American people instructed them to do so through legislation. ""Courts should not intervene where there is a robust political debate because doing so poisons the political well, imposing a destructive anti-majoritarian constitutional ruling on a vigorous debate,"" he said. The decision came less than a month after the court heard arguments on 27 September. The Supreme Court is expected to take up a case on Doma as well as an ongoing legal wrangle over a gay marriage ban in the state of California, a law known as Proposition 8.","A US law defining marriage as being only between one man and one woman has been struck down by a second appeal court, this time in New York."
"The state's Liberal-National Party, allied to Mr Abbott's ruling coalition, lost the largest political majority in Australian history after just one term. The PM accepted his coalition had ""difficulties"" but said that government was about competence not popularity. The latest opinion poll suggested his coalition would be defeated if an election were held now. The poll in the Sunday Telegraph registered a drop in support for the coalition from 53.5% in the 2013 national election victory to just 43% now, compared to 57% for Labor. Mr Abbott's personal ratings had slumped to 27%, as opposed to 44% for Labor leader Bill Shorten. 'Career over' Amid rumours Mr Abbott could face challenges for the leadership of his party, the PM said: ""There are obviously lessons in the election result last night and we're determined to learn them in Canberra. ""I accept that we need to learn from the difficulties that we've had, but in the end, government is not a popularity contest, it is a competence contest. ""The people of Australia elected me as prime minister and they elected my government to get on with the job of governing our country."" Queensland's Labor Party leader Annastacia Palaszczuk said: ""It's just been absolutely amazing, the support right across the length and breadth of Queensland, it is extremely humbling and we are going to restore good governing to this state."" The latest results show Labor on 43 and the LNP on 40. Premier Campbell Newman lost his own seat. The LNP won 78 seats in 2012. ""My political career is over,"" Mr Newman said. Attorney-General George Brandis insisted on Sunday there would be no repeat in the Liberal Party of the leadership challenge that tore apart the previous Labor government. However, Mr Abbott will deliver a speech in Canberra on Monday which analysts say will be one of the more important of his career. Jane Prentice, a Liberal National backbencher, told ABC television: ""Tony has said he has listened and learned. He is making a keynote speech on Monday at the Press Club but we can't continue as we are. I think that's the lesson from today.""

"Under the deal, India has committed to ensuring that at least 40% of its electricity will be generated from non-fossil sources by 2030. CO2 emissions are believed to be the driving force behind climate change. Last December in Paris, countries agreed to cut emissions in a bid to keep the global average rise in temperatures below 2C. The Paris deal is the world's first comprehensive climate agreement. It will only come into force legally after it is ratified by at least 55 countries which between them produce at least 55% of global carbon emissions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced last month that India would ratify the agreement on 2 October, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the struggle for independence from Britain. ""India has deposited its instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement with the United Nations,"" the UN said in a statement on Sunday. The US and China - together responsible for 40% of the world's carbon emissions - both formally joined the Paris global climate agreement earlier this month. India accounts for about 4.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and became the 62nd country to ratify the agreement.

"An Environmental Justice Foundation report says West Africa has the world's highest levels of illegal fishing. It says pirate fishermen fish inside exclusion zones, attack local fisherman and refuse to pay fines. An EU spokesman said he was ""very concerned"" that illegally fished produce could enter Europe's markets. The UK-based campaign group has called for vessels which break the law to be blacklisted. It urges that weaknesses in EU regulations be addressed to stop illegal fish entering Europe. ""The EU is relying too heavily on the assurances of flag states that plainly are not monitoring their fishing fleets in West Africa,"" said EJF Executive Director Steve Trent. ""Authorities inspecting fish in European ports have very little reliable information on what is happening in the areas where it is caught. ""We must urgently improve communication between the EU and coastal States if we are serious about ending pirate fishing and protecting some of the world's most vulnerable coastal communities."" Oliver Drewes, spokesman for European Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Commissioner Maria Damanaki, told the Reuters news agency that if the abuses were confirmed, the offending vessels would be banned from exporting to the EU and barred from European ports. 'Out of control' The EJF's 36-page report - entitled Exposing Pirate Fishing: The Fight Against Illegal Fishing in West Africa and the EU - documents ""rampant pirate fishing in Sierra Leone and laundering of the illegal catch into the European seafood market by vessels accredited to export fish to the EU"". ""Despite the EU regulation to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, evidence collected on 10 vessels believed to account for the majority of reports revealed that nine are accredited to export their catches to the EU, the world's most valuable import market for fish,"" says the report. It found pirate fishing vessels were out of control: The evidence of illegal activity collected through what the EJF called its ""community surveillance project"" has been sent to the governments of Sierra Leone and South Korea, as well as the EU. The report quotes Victor Kargbo, head of Fisheries Enforcement in Sierra Leone, as saying a corner had been turned in the fight against poachers in Sierra Leone, but that efforts must be co-ordinated to prevent ""unscrupulous operators"" simply relocating and continuing their activities elsewhere. ""The EU can play a crucial role in deterring illegal fishing by making sure all fish entering has a catch certificate, but they should only accept imports from flag States that monitor their fleets properly,"" he said. Sierra Leone's Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources Soccoh Kabia told the BBC: ""This is a problem that has affected us for many years now and and has had serious repercussions for us as a people in terms of economic consequences as well as threatening our food security."" But he said that those fishing illegally should not think they can get away ""scot free because one of these days we're going to get you and you'll pay for it"". West African waters have the highest levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the world, representing up to 37% of the region's catch, says the report. It reported 252 cases of illegal pirate fishing by industrial vessels in inshore areas over an 18-month period. In addition, the EJF said 90% of the pirate vessels it investigated in West Africa were bottom trawlers ""which devastate marine environments by dragging heavy trawl equipment along the seabed"". Global losses from pirate fishing were estimated to amount to $10-$23.5bn (£6-15bn) each year, said the EJF.","The vast majority of pirate vessels illegally fishing off Sierra Leone are accredited to export their catches to Europe, an environmentalist group says."
"By Andrew HardingBBC News, Nairobi ""The security operation… is over and all the terrorists eliminated,"" Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta announced on national television, to widespread public relief. Throughout the night, cowering groups of civilians - many had spent hours hiding in their offices or in bathrooms - were escorted to safety by security forces. The sporadic bursts of gunfire and the boom of explosions continued well beyond dawn. ""Eight hours and still praying for a rescue hopefully soon,"" businesswoman Aggie Asiimwe Konde texted from her hiding place overnight, before being rescued three hours later with ""over 50 people in my group. No injuries"". ""Please help… I am at 14 Riverside Drive… huge bomb then gunshots now I am hiding in toilet,"" Ronald Ng'eno messaged on social media. Two hours later he said he was ""still hiding… Phone charge almost off… We are still in bathroom gunshots in building, please pray… If I die… please tell my family I love the(m)."" He was also rescued early on Wednesday morning. Read more: On the crowded street outside the large, upmarket complex, friends and relatives embraced those who emerged, and thanked Kenyan security forces. A fleet of ambulances stood ready to take the wounded to hospital. ""We managed to move slowly… and carefully, as the gunfire was getting closer, then we managed to jump over a small fence,"" said one man. At least one British citizen and an American were among the dead. The American victim was named as Jason Spindler. His brother, Jonathan, announced on Twitter that Jason had survived the 9/11 attacks in New York, and ""passed away this morning during a terror attack in Nairobi… I am sure he gave them hell!"" Several bodies were photographed slumped at their tables in the Secret Garden restaurant - among the first places that the gunmen targeted on Tuesday afternoon. 'Attackers had visited hotel before' The attackers - thought to be members of Somalia's militant al-Shabab group - were filmed by a security camera as they walked, in dark camouflage outfits, through a car park and then opened fire. A guard later reported that he had seen the same group visiting the hotel - presumably to acquaint themselves with the layout - in the days leading up to the attack. President Kenyatta confirmed that 14 people had been killed and more than 700 rescued. However, there is speculation that the death toll may rise, as well as a long-standing degree of public scepticism about official figures. Kenya's security services have faced strong criticism for their handling of past terrorist incidents - in particular the 2013 Westgate Mall attack in which rival agencies were accused of infighting, looting, and lying about key details of the four-day siege. On Wednesday, President Kenyatta and his interior minister both implied that lessons had been learned. ""I want to commend the quick and effective response by our elite fighting teams for neutralizing all the terrorists. We have dealt with the threat decisively, and shown our enemies and the world that we are ready to deal with any threat to our nation,"" said Mr Kenyatta. 'Tourists are safe' Interior Minister Fred Matiangi told journalists outside the compound that the operation demonstrated ""how well our security forces are prepared"". On Tuesday evening, the minister had faced criticism for claiming, prematurely, that all the buildings had been secured. He declined to confirm how many attackers had been involved, or killed. Kenya's vital but precarious tourism industry has been badly damaged by past terrorist attacks - not least Westgate and the 2015 attack on a university campus in Garissa - and by negative travel advice issued by foreign governments. This time, President Kenyatta was quick to ""assure every Kenyan and foreign visitor"" that they were safe. The latest attack came on the third anniversary of a devastating assault by al-Shabab militants on a Kenyan army post in Somalia in which, it is widely suspected, as many as 180 Kenyan troops were killed. It is a stark reminder that al-Shabab remains a powerful force, with the capacity to strike at a well-guarded target in a neighbouring country.","After 19 hours of terror, gunfire, bloodshed, and inevitable confusion, the siege at an upmarket hotel and business complex in the hills west of Nairobi's central business district ended abruptly on Wednesday morning."
"Ten people were killed and 10 were injured at Santa Fe High School when a student opened fire. The suspect is Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17. The embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC confirmed that student Sabika Sheikh was among the dead. Substitute teacher Cynthia Tisdale was also killed in the attack, her family told US media outlets. Mrs Tisdale's niece and brother-in-law both confirmed the news. Writing on Facebook, John Tisdale said his sister-in-law was an ""amazing person"". Sabika Sheikh, aged 17, had been on the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange & Study Abroad programme (YES). The programme is run by the US state department, and was set up in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks to bring students from Muslim-majority nations to the US on a cultural exchange. Her parents, Abdul Aziz and Farah Sheikh, told the BBC they heard about the shooting through television news. They said they confirmed their daughter's death within an hour by speaking to school administrators. Ms Sheikh's body would be returned to her home in Karachi early next week, they said. Other victims, believed to be mostly students, are expected to be identified by Texas authorities later on Saturday. The attacker, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, was arrested and charged with murder. He allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons. What happened during the attack? Students said the shooter entered an art class and opened fire shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT) on Friday. There were 1,400 students in the school at the time of the attack. One student, Breanna Quintanilla, told AP that Mr Pagourtzis walked into the room, pointed at someone, and announced: ""I'm going to kill you."" Ms Quintanilla was wounded in her leg as she fled. Officers stationed at the school engaged Mr Pagourtzis. One of them, John Barnes, was injured. He was in a critical condition and undergoing surgery, local media reported. Police also found information in the suspect's diary, and on his computer and mobile phone, suggesting that he planned the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the teenager ""gave himself up"" because ""he didn't have the courage to commit the suicide"". Mr Abbott also said ""various kinds of explosive devices"" had been found at the school, 40 miles (65km) south of Houston, and off-campus. They included ""a CO2 device"" and ""a Molotov cocktail"", he said. So far this year, more than 5,000 people have died in shooting incidents in the United States, according to monitoring group the Gun Violence Archive. The aftermath Hundreds of people gathered at sunset on Friday on a large open lawn near the school for a vigil. The sound of preachers and politicians was intermittently drowned out by wailing and sobs from attendees, the BBC's Paul Blake said. President Donald Trump, speaking at a prison reform event at the White House, described the attack as ""absolutely horrific"". ""My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves, and to others,"" he said. The White House school safety panel - set up in the aftermath of the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year- had been ""activated"" and would meet next week, the White House said. Governor Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools"". One professional athlete from the state - JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans NFL team - has offered to pay the funeral expenses of the victims. How does it compare with previous school shootings? The Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes: Gun control advocates have criticised what they see as minor changes amid continued support for the NRA from leading politicians. The worst school shooting in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in 2007, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured. There have been more deaths in US school shootings so far in 2018 than there have been deaths in the US military, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. What do we know about the attacker? Authorities said journals kept by Mr Pagourtzis, 17, showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. But Mr Abbott told reporters that, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Mr Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday. ""Unlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,"" Mr Abbott said. ""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On 30 April he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"". He is being held at Galveston County Jail on a charge of capital murder.",An exchange student from Pakistan is among the first named victims of a Texas high school shooting.
"It says most victims were human rights leaders or members of left-wing groups, and calls on the government to provide protection. Areas with illegal drug crops were the most dangerous, it said. The UN warned that armed groups were moving into territories previously occupied by Farc rebels. Under a peace deal signed in November, the Farc rebels have moved to transition zones where they will remain until they fully demobilise. The UN said the illegal armed groups were fighting for territory and resources. The UN representative in Colombia, Todd Howland, said the groups were often involved in drug trafficking and illegal gold mining and see activists as a threat. Mr Howland called on the government to recognise that the deaths formed a pattern and to provide protection to those in danger. Colombia's Interior Minister Juan Fernando Cristo, said violence against rights defenders could undermine the peace deal. ""We're all interested in facing these threats and these murders because we know that it seriously affects the chances of consolidating peace in Colombia,"" he said.","Dozens of rights activists were killed in Colombia last year, according to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Police said she stabbed the man, a friend of her father's, in March when she had gone to his house to do chores. But state prosecutors in the commercial capital, Lagos, say there is no evidence to support a murder charge. At the time of her arrest, there was an outcry on social media by people saying she had acted in self-defence. The teenager has been freed at a time of public protests over a wave of rapes and killing of women in Nigeria. Thousands have recently signed a petition calling for an end to sexual violence. Many Nigerians say the country's legal system makes it hard to convict suspected rapists and blames women when they are victims of sexual assault. Magistrate Philip Ojo said, in response to advice from Lagos State's Director of Public Prosecutions, that the teenager should be freed from custody as the ""ingredients required to prove the offence of murder against the suspect were not all present. ""Also clearly intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased cannot be established,"" he said on Wednesday. After the 51-year-old man had been killed, the teenager was held at a correctional home for girls in Lagos. Neither the girl nor her family have commented on the incident. 'Lockdown rapes' On Wednesday, Nigeria's Minister of Women's Affairs Pauline Tallen spoke about the ""alarming"" spike in rape cases in the country that have happened during the lockdown imposed in some areas to limit the spread of coronavirus. ""There has been an outcry against rape epidemic because of the lockdown,"" she said, calling on security agencies to speed up investigations. You may also be interested in: Rape cases had recently increased by a factor of three, noting that ""women and children are locked down with their abusers"", the minister said. The results of a survey published by NOIPolls in July 2019 suggested that up to one in every three girls living in Nigeria could have experienced at least one form of sexual assault by the time they reach 25. It is not uncommon for rape to go unreported - with some victims and their families, fearing stigmatisation, police extortion and a lack of trust in the judicial process, choose not to report cases to the authorities.",Nigerian prosecutors have decided not to press charges against a 15-year-old girl detained after killing a man who had attempted to rape her.
"Photographer William Henry Jackson photographed the Wyoming-based park in 1871, the year before Congress made Yellowstone the first national park in the world. More than a century later, photographer Brad Boner set out to replicate Jackson's black-and-white photographs. Some of his pictures will be displayed next to Jackson's this summer at the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The top picture on this page, The Fishing Bridge, suggests the only change in those 14 decades is a man-made one - the bridge itself, says David Quammen, a contributing writer for National Geographic who wrote the magazine's May 2016 issue on Yellowstone,. That is because the geological features of Yellowstone - the rocks and the geysers and the landscape - are still very much the same, he adds. What has changed is the way people have populated and developed the park in that time, he says, and the photographs do not tell the whole story. Most people do not realise Yellowstone began as a tourist attraction and only later became a wildlife refuge, he says. ""Yellowstone has changed vastly - in some ways for better, in some ways for the worse,"" says Mr Quammen. ""Those changes mostly involve ecological changes."" Animal populations have prospered, he says, with more wolves in the park now than at the time when Jackson took his camera and headed off on that expedition. As the park has become an increasingly popular tourist destination, there have been huge changes in infrastructure, says Mr Quammen, like the bridge, roads, hotels and tourist shops. But he thinks the people who now run the park are sensitive to the fact that as visitor numbers increase, the scenic resources are put under strain. Limits will have to be placed on how many people can visit, he says. Last year, four million people came to Yellowstone. ""The real changes in Yellowstone are off-screen - it has become a wildlife refuge, and it is filled with people in cars and hotels, and these photos don't show that,"" he says. Mr Boner has been talking about his techniques. He says he walked around the park holding his photos up to the horizon, in order to replicate Jackson. ""The whole point of creating Yellowstone was to give future generations an opportunity to experience these special places,"" he told the AP news agency. ""When I look at these pictures, I take a great deal of comfort in knowing that my kids are going to be able to go to a lot of these places and see the same thing."" Things would just ""click and fall into place"" when he was trying to find the right frame, he says. ""All of a sudden, you're looking at the landscape that is in the photograph that I was holding, that Jackson took. There were definitely times I got goose bumps."" Reporting by Ashley Gold","After 140 years, the boulders, canyons and geysers of Yellowstone National Park appear to be no worse for wear, according to newly released images."
"The ministry claimed the image showed an IS convoy leaving a Syrian town last week aided by US forces. Instead, it came from the smartphone game AC-130 Gunship Simulator: Special Ops Squadron. The ministry said an employee had mistakenly attached the photo. The Conflict Intelligence Team fact-checking group said the other four provided were also errors, taken from a June 2016 video which showed the Iraqi Air Force attacking IS in Iraq. The video game image seems to be taken from a promotional video on the game's website and YouTube channel, closely cropped to omit the game controls and on-screen information. In the corner of the image, however, a few letters of the developer's disclaimer can still be seen: ""Development footage. This is a work in progress. All content subject to change."" Hours later, the ministry published an updated statement with a different set of images, which it also said proved their claims. It repeated the claim it was ""irrefutable evidence that US are actually covering Isis [IS] combat units to recover their combat capabilities, redeploy, and use them to promote the American interests in the Middle East"". Russia alleges the US is co-operating with so-called Islamic State by providing cover to fleeing IS militants. In a Facebook post, the ministry said it liberated the town of Abu Kamal last week alongside the Syrian army. It said the US-led coalition refused requests to cooperate and ""eliminate fleeing Isis convoys"". It also accused the US-led coalition of carrying out air operations in the area to interfere with possible Russian strikes, and alleged that IS forces were disguising themselves as US-backed SDF fighters. ""The US are actually covering the Isis combat units to recover their combat capabilities, redeploy, and use them to promote the American interests in the Middle East,"" the statement concluded. A later press release said it had launched a probe into the actions of a civilian employee of one of its subdivisions who ""mistakenly attached photos"" to the first version of its statement. Responding to Russia's allegations in remarks carried by Reuters, a spokesman for the US-led coalition Col Ryan Dillon said the Russian allegations were ""about as accurate as their air campaign"". ""I certainly can't verify, but I've seen the report that one of the pictures came from a video game. So, again that is pretty consistent with what we have seen come out of Russian MoD, as being baseless, inaccurate and you know, completely false,"" he said.","Russia's Ministry of Defence has posted what it called ""irrefutable proof"" of the US aiding so-called Islamic State - but one of the images was actually taken from a video game."
"By Jessica MurphyBBC News, Toronto Kevin Garratt remembers well the night he and Julia were arrested in north-eastern China. He recalls being pulled away from his wife as they walked through a restaurant's downstairs lobby, and pushed into the back of a black sedan filled with burly officers. He thought the whole thing was some terrible mistake. Julia, forced into a separate sedan, found herself shaking in fear and shock at the sudden turn of events, and the drive in the darkness. She thought: ""This is going to be my last night. ""I don't think I've ever felt that level of fear and panic before. And also just sad for my family and my children, because there was no warning, there would be no chance to say goodbye."" The Garratts had lived in China since 1984, and from 2008 operated a coffee house popular with Western expats and tourists in Dandong, a city on the North Korean border, while continuing to carry out Christian aid work. But unbeknownst to either of them, early in 2014 and thousands of miles away, American authorities were launching a crackdown on Chinese cyber-espionage. One of the men in their sights was Su Bin, a Chinese resident working in Canada. That June, Canadian authorities picked up Su, accused of stealing data about military projects and selling it to China, for extradition to the US. While China has denied it, Canadian officials and observers believed the Garratts' arrest was a tit-for-tat detention and an attempt to pressure Canada for Su's release. Canada's ambassador in Beijing at the time, Guy Saint-Jacques, describes them as ""a couple of Canadian missionaries who had been in China 30 years doing good work"". He tells the BBC their arrest ""was the first case where we saw a clear retaliation for something that had happened in Canada"". When he met counterparts at the foreign ministry about the case, Saint-Jacques recalls: ""They never said directly 'let's do a swap.' But it was very clear what they wanted."" On the night of the Garratts' arrest - the beginning of months of detention for the pair - they had been invited for dinner by a friend of a friend, who told the couple they wanted to talk about their daughter going to study in Canada. But something about the dinner felt strange. ""It didn't seem genuine, and the daughter never came,"" Kevin says. Julia says it was only later they realised the whole evening had been a set-up for their arrest. ""It was very carefully thought through and planned in advance. We had no idea,"" she says. Parts of the couple's story could be pulled directly from today's headlines. In December, Chinese telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou, 46, was detained in Vancouver for allegedly breaking US sanctions against Iran. This week, the US filed charges against Huawei and Meng, and the US is seeking her extradition. Both Huawei and Meng have rejected the allegations. Following Meng's arrest came threats of ""grave consequences"" from China if the tech heiress and chief finance officer at Huawei, China's largest private company, was not released. In mid-December, two Canadian men - former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor - were held in China on accusations of harming national security. Like in the Garratts' case, their detention is seen by many China analysts as a reprisal. The Garratts' experience in detention parallels what Canadian officials and others have suggested that Kovrig and Spavor are living through - daily interrogations, being kept in a room with lights on day and night. ""I don't know what they did or didn't do, but I know what they're going through right now,"" says Julia. The Garratts say they were never physically harmed but were watched by guards around the clock, and had to request the most basic necessities when they needed them. ""You want a drink of water, they have to go get it for it. Brush your teeth, they get it for you. It's really meant to frighten and control you,"" says Kevin. Julia says the first few nights, she put a blanket over her eyes to block the light, but the guard pulled it down. ""I thought: 'That's a rule, I can't cover my face to sleep in the dark, they need the lights shining in my face.' They had very strict protocol."" They also experienced daily interrogations for up to six hours. Tit for tat arrests Their interrogators had a decade of details about their time in China and their travels, and asked over and over about the minutia of their activities - the why, the when, and the where. Whom they met. ""They would ask the same questions two month later and compare the answers,"" says Julia. ""It's very, very gruelling."" Some four years later, they have documented their experience in a book, Two Tears on the Window, published in November. Devout Christians, they say prayer and the support of both their close family and the wider church community helped them through their time in detention. ""I had the sense that my peace cannot be stolen from me, my true freedom cannot be stolen from me. And I think there was great comfort in that,"" says Julia. She was released on bail in February 2015, pending trial. In January 2016, still in detention, Kevin was charged with stealing state secrets. A month later, Su waived extradition and headed to the US, where in March he pleaded guilty to hacking into major US defence contractors, stealing sensitive military data and sending it to China. Saint-Jacques says that Chinese officials seemed taken by surprise by Su's decision to cut a deal with American officials. He believes that turn of events, combined with a visit to China by Justin Trudeau, during which the newly elected PM raised Kevin's case, were instrumental in securing Kevin's release. He was deported to Canada in September 2016 after 775 days in detention, and reunited with Julia, who had left the country earlier that year. Meanwhile, Meng's case continues to strain China's ties with Canada and the US. Chinese officials have called her arrest a ""serious mistake"", accusing Canada of double standards and ""Western egotism and white supremacy"". She is out on bail and under house arrest in Vancouver, where she owns property. She is next due in court on 6 March, but the case could possibly drag on for years. It also comes amid growing scrutiny in Western countries over Huawei, which is a world leader in telecoms infrastructure, in particular the next generation of mobile phone networks, known as 5G. Concern about the security of the company's technology has been growing, particularly in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany, which fear its products could be used for spying, an allegation which Huawei denies. Amid the diplomatic dispute, Canada has worked to rally international allies to its corner. Earlier this month, over 140 diplomats - including Saint-Jacques - and academics signed an open letter to President Xi Jinping calling for the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Canada also fired ambassador John McCallum on Sunday following controversial comments he made about Meng's extradition case. For the Garratts, despite the international significance of cases such as theirs, it's important to remember that individuals and their families have got caught up in the dispute. ""The human cost is huge. That's the largest cost that's paid by the individuals that are directly implicated, unjustly implicated by these big things,"" she says.","Canadian couple Kevin and Julia Garratt were detained in China in 2014 and accused of spying. Amid an escalating feud between Canada and China and allegations of retaliatory detentions, the pair tells the BBC about what it was like - and how they ever made it home."
"It emerged with the help of Iran during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s, though its ideological roots stretch back to the Shia Islamic revival in Lebanon in the 1960s and '70s. After Israel withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and continued to strengthen its military wing, the Islamic Resistance. In some ways, its capabilities now exceed those of the Lebanese army, its considerable firepower used against Israel in the 2006 war. The group also gradually became a key power broker in Lebanon's political system, and has effectively gained veto power in the cabinet. Hezbollah has been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets and is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Some Lebanese consider Hezbollah a threat to the country's stability, but it is enduringly popular within the Shia community. 'Resistance' Hezbollah's precise origins are difficult to pinpoint, but its precursors emerged following the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants in 1982, when Shia leaders favouring a militant response broke away from the leading Amal movement. The new organisation, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah. The groups launched attacks on the Israeli military and its ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), as well as foreign powers in Lebanon. They are believed to have been behind the bombings of the US embassy and US Marine barracks in 1983, which together left 258 Americans and 58 French servicemen dead, and led Western peacekeeping forces to withdraw. In 1985, Hezbollah officially announced its establishment by publishing an ""open letter"" that identified the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's principal enemies and called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, which it said was occupying Muslim lands. It also called for the ""adoption of the Islamic system on the basis of free and direct selection of the people, not the basis of forceful imposition"". The 1989 Taif Accord that ended Lebanon's civil war and called for the disarmament of militias prompted Hezbollah to rebrand its military wing as an ""Islamic Resistance"" force dedicated to ending Israel's occupation, allowing it to keep its weapons. After the Syrian military imposed peace on Lebanon in 1990, Hezbollah continued its guerrilla war in South Lebanon, but also began to play an active role in Lebanese politics. In 1992, it successfully participated in national elections for the first time. When Israeli forces finally withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah was credited with pushing them out. The group resisted pressure to disarm and maintained its military presence in the South, claiming as justification the continued Israeli presence in the Shebaa Farms and other disputed areas. In 2006, Hezbollah militants launched a cross-border attack in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two others kidnapped, triggering a massive Israeli response. Israeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah strongholds in the South and in Beirut's southern suburbs, while Hezbollah fired about 4,000 rockets at Israel. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day conflict, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians. Hezbollah survived the war and emerged emboldened. Although it is has since upgraded and expanded its arsenal and recruited scores of new fighters, there has been no major flare-up along the border area, which is now patrolled by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese army. 'Political vision' In 2008, when Lebanon's Western-backed government moved to shut down Hezbollah's private telecommunications network and remove Beirut airport's security chief over ties to the group, Hezbollah responded by seizing much of the capital and fighting rival Sunni groups. To end the sectarian clashes that left 81 people dead and brought Lebanon to the brink of a new civil war, the government backed down and a power-sharing agreement gave Hezbollah and its allies the power to veto any cabinet decision. In 2009 elections it won 10 seats in parliament and remained in the unity government. Later that year, Hezbollah's secretary general Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah issued a new political manifesto that sought to highlight the group's ""political vision"". It dropped the reference to an Islamic republic found in the 1985 manifesto, but maintained a tough line against Israel and the US and said Hezbollah needed to keep its weapons. In 2011, the group and its allies forced the collapse of the unity government led by Saad Hariri, a Saudi-backed Sunni, with Hezbollah warning that it would not stand by as four of its members were accused of involvement in the 2005 assassination of Mr Hariri's father Rafik. Hezbollah and its allies have continued to be part of subsequent governments, where they wield considerable influence. As the war in Syria escalated, thousands of Hezbollah militants went to fight for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, proving decisive in helping pro-government forces recover ground lost to rebels, particularly along the Lebanese border. Hezbollah's involvement in Syria, however, has sharpened sectarian tensions in Lebanon, where the group has been targeted in a series of bombings by Sunni militants. Its support for Syria's Shia Alawite president and alliance with Iran has also seen a deepening of hostility from Gulf Arab states, led by Iran's main regional rival, Saudi Arabia. In early 2016, Saudi Arabia led Gulf countries and the Arab League to declare Hezbollah a terrorist group, accusing it of ""hostile acts"".","Hezbollah - the Party of God - is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon."
"After strong winds and freezing winter conditions swept across three south-eastern states, parts of the country experienced rare snowfall. Twitter user Stephen Grenfell filmed the kangaroos as he drove past their paddock in New South Wales on Saturday. Posting the clip, he wrote: ""Not something you see every day in Australia. Kangaroos in the snow."" In response, another user posted a photo of kangaroos in the snow on a golf course. Meteorologists have said this is one of the coldest outbreaks to hit Australia in recent years. In the capital Canberra local media reported that an Australian rules football match was played in the snow for the first time. The snowfall also led to road closures outside of Sydney. The cold front also caused flights cancellations and power cuts in about 10,000 homes in the south of the country. Australia has experienced extreme weather events in the past year, including floods, bushfires and cyclones. It also continues to be ravaged by a prolonged drought which has put significant strain on rural communities.",Footage has emerged of kangaroos bounding through a field in Australia that has been blanketed in snow.
"The resolution also calls on Myanmar to stop the incitement of hatred against the Rohingya and other minorities. Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in the Buddhist-majority country in 2017. Myanmar (formerly Burma) insists it was tackling an extremist threat. Earlier this month, the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi rejected allegations of genocide at the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ). The UN resolution passed on Friday expressed alarm at the continuing influx of Rohingya to Bangladesh over the past four decades ""in the aftermath of atrocities committed by the security and armed forces of Myanmar"". It highlighted the findings of an independent international mission ""of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities"" by Myanmar's security forces, which the mission described as ""the gravest crimes under international law"". The resolution called on Myanmar to protect all groups and to ensure justice for all violations of human rights. It was passed by a total of 134 countries in the 193-member world body, with nine votes against and 28 abstaining. UN General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but can reflect world opinion. The UN ambassador for Myanmar, Hau Do Suan, called the resolution ""another classic example of double-standards [and] selective and discriminatory application of human rights norms"". He said it was designed to exert ""unwanted political pressure"" on Myanmar and did not attempt to find a solution to ""the complex situation in Rakhine state"". The Gambia, a small Muslim-majority west African nation, brought the Rohingya case to the ICJ on behalf of dozens of other Muslim countries. Addressing the court earlier this month, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi called the case against Myanmar ""incomplete and incorrect"". She said troubles in Rakhine, where many Rohingya lived, went back centuries. Ms Suu Kyi said the violence was an ""internal armed conflict"" triggered by Rohingya militant attacks on government security posts. She conceded that Myanmar's military might have used disproportionate force at times, but said that if soldiers had committed war crimes ""they will be prosecuted"". What are the accusations? At the start of 2017, there were a million Rohingya in Myanmar, most living in Rakhine state. Myanmar, a mainly Buddhist country, regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants and denies them citizenship. The Rohingya have long complained of persecution, and in 2017 Myanmar's military - the Tatmadaw - launched a massive military operation in Rakhine. According to The Gambia's submission to the ICJ, the clearances were ""intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part"", via mass murder, rape and setting fire to their buildings ""often with inhabitants locked inside"". A UN fact-finding mission which investigated the allegations found such compelling evidence that it said the Burmese army must be investigated for genocide against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine. In August, a report accused Myanmar soldiers of ""routinely and systematically employing rape, gang rape and other violent and forced sexual acts against women, girls, boys, men and transgender people"". In May, seven Myanmar soldiers jailed for killing 10 Rohingya men and boys were released early from prison. Myanmar says its military operations targeted Rohingya militants, and the military has previously cleared itself of wrongdoing. What is the current situation for the Rohingya? Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar since the military operations began. As of 30 September, there were 915,000 Rohingya refugees in camps in Bangladesh. Almost 80% arrived between August and December 2017, and in March this year, Bangladesh said it would accept no more. In August, Bangladesh set up a voluntary return scheme - but not a single Rohingya person chose to go. Bangladesh plans to relocate 100,000 refugees to Bhasan Char, a small island in the Bay of Bengal, but some 39 aid agencies and human rights groups have opposed the idea. In September, the BBC's Jonathan Head reported that police barracks, government buildings and refugee relocation camps had been built on the sites of former Rohingya villages in Myanmar.",The UN General Assembly has approved a resolution condemning human rights abuses against Muslim Rohingya and other minorities in Myanmar.
"The Pope told a group of 16 refugees at an interfaith meeting in the capital Dhaka: ""The presence of God today is also called Rohingya."" He refrained from using the term on his earlier visit to Myanmar, which does not regard Rohingya as an ethnic group. Some 620,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar since August. The Pope had been criticised by rights groups for not using the term in Myanmar, whose military has been accused of ethnic cleansing by the United Nations. He had used the term before his visit. Myanmar's government rejects the term Rohingya, labelling the community ""Bengalis"". It says they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Making a difference? Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka It was a poignant moment when Pope Francis met Rohingya refugees in Dhaka. One by one they went up on stage and met him. He held their hands and they each had a chance to say a few words to him. He placed his hand on the head of a little girl who was part of the group. Then in a short speech that was not part of the original programme Pope Francis used the contentious word ""Rohingya"" for the first time sending out his strongest message so far about the crisis during his visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh. But does it really make a difference especially since he didn't use the word or speak directly about the issue in Myanmar, the country that matters? Mark Pierce from Save the Children told me his organisation would certainly have preferred the Pope to be more vocal about the crisis in Myanmar but says it is significant that he has spoken about it here in Bangladesh because it helps keep the spotlight on the plight of the refugees. About 3,000 refugees are estimated to have crossed over from Myanmar to Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh in the past week alone adding to the hundreds of thousands who are already there living in camps. While there is an agreement between the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar for the refugees to return, there are still no details of when or how this will happen. Pope Francis' comment to refugees in Dhaka was made in an improvised remark and was not in his speech to the interfaith meeting. ""In the name of all of those who have persecuted you, hurt you, I ask forgiveness,"" Pope Francis told the refugees. ""I appeal to your large hearts to give us the forgiveness that we are asking."" Rights groups had urged the Pope to use the term Rohingya to back the community. However, he had been warned by Catholic representatives in Myanmar not to use the term for fear of alienating the Buddhist majority. The number of Catholics in Bangladesh is very small. The 350,000-strong community makes up 0.2% of the population. Earlier, the Pope ordained 16 priests at an outdoor Mass in Dhaka's Suhrawardy Udyan park. On the penultimate day of his Asia trip, he told the crowd: ""I know that many of you came from afar, for a trip for more than two days. Thank you for your generosity. This indicates the love you have for the Church.""",Pope Francis has met a group of Muslim Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and referred to them by name for the first time on his Asian visit.
"The official, Jerry Matjila, told MPs in Cape Town that Swaziland needed the money to pay its civil servants. South Africa's opposition said the request should be rejected because Swaziland was an ""undemocratic state"". Swaziland is one of Africa's poorest countries and is governed by an absolute monarch. Mr Matjila, who heads South Africa's International Relations department, said Pretoria was considering the request. ""The question is how much can we help. We want a stable continent. We start with our neighbours,"" Bloomberg news agency quotes Mr Matjila as saying. 'Lavish lifestyle' A spokesman for the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), Kenneth Mubu, told the BBC's Focus on Africa that the government should not ""prop up"" the government of King Mswati III. ""It must first democratise, respect human rights and allow free political activity,"" Mr Mubu said. He added that South Africa should also demand that King Mswati, who has 13 wives, end his lavish lifestyle as a pre-condition for aid. ""The king must reduce his expenditure which is a very big proportion of Swaziland's budget,"" he said. The Swazi monarchy banned political parties nearly 40 years ago. In April, police fired teargas to break up pro-democracy protests organised by trade unions. Swaziland is Africa's third-largest sugar producer, but it lost about a third of its revenue last year after it was badly affected by the global economic crisis. Swaziland's government said last week it has asked the World Bank and African Development Bank for ""budget support loans"", and it was also considering other sources of funding. According to South Africa's Business Report newspaper, the Swazi government has cut the salaries of politicians by 10% because of the financial crisis. King Mswati has also cancelled his silver jubilee celebrations, due to take place later this year, the paper said.","Swaziland has asked South Africa for a financial bailout as it risks running out of money, South Africa's top foreign affairs official says."
"Mr Taylor will step down in January when his temporary appointment is due to expire, the New York Times reported. His tenure could have been extended by the Republican-controlled Senate but no such move has been made. Mr Taylor took up the post in June after Mr Trump controversially withdrew the then ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. Ms Yovanovitch has said she was the victim of a smear campaign by Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. A replacement for Mr Taylor has not yet been announced. News of his departure was met with concern by Senator Robert Menendez, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said he feared it would create a vacuum in Ukraine, which is still grappling with Russian-backed separatists. In his testimony before the impeachment inquiry last month, Mr Taylor said that a member of his staff overheard a telephone call in which President Trump inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. The call was with Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the European Union, who reportedly told the president over the phone from a restaurant in Kyiv that ""the Ukrainians were ready to move forward"". After the call, the staff member ""asked Mr Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine"", Mr Taylor said. Mr Taylor said: ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden."" President Trump is accused of withholding US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's president to publicly announce a corruption inquiry into Mr Biden. He denies any wrongdoing and has described the impeachment inquiry as a ""witch hunt"". A majority of House Democrats are expected to vote to impeach Mr Trump on Wednesday.","Acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, whose testimony helped build the case for impeaching Donald Trump, is to leave his post next month."
"Nearly 68% of the voters supported plans to give shareholders a veto on compensation and ban big payouts for new and departing managers. Business groups argued the proposals would damage Swiss competitiveness. But analysts say ordinary Swiss are concerned about a growing economic divide in the country. The vote came just days after the EU approved measures to cap bankers' bonuses. 'Fat cat initiative' The final results showed that all 26 Swiss cantons backed the proposals. In all, 1.6 million voters said ""Yes"" against 762,000, who rejected the idea. The BBC's Imogen Foulkes, in Berne, says multibillion dollar losses by Swiss banking giant UBS, and thousands of redundancies at pharmaceutical company Novartis, have caused anger in Switzerland - because high salaries and bonuses for managers continued unchanged. The new measures will give Switzerland some of the world's strictest corporate rules, our correspondent adds. Shareholders will have a veto over salaries, golden handshakes will be forbidden, and managers of companies who flout the rules could face prison. The ""fat cat initiative"", as it has been called, will be written into the Swiss constitution and apply to all Swiss companies listed on Switzerland's stock exchange. Support for the plans - brain child of Swiss businessman turned politician Thomas Minder - has been fuelled by a series of perceived disasters for major Swiss companies, coupled with salaries and bonuses staying high. Our correspondent says the main example is banking giant UBS, which wrote off billions in the wake of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, and then had to be bailed out by the Swiss government. A further incident came in February when it was announced that the outgoing chairman Novartis', Daniel Vasella, would be receiving a 72m Swiss francs (£51m; $78m) ""non-compete"" pay off over six years, designed to stop him working for other related industries. The payment was later scrapped, but it provoked anger and amazement in Switzerland, because his salary had been regarded as too high and the firm had been cutting jobs, our correspondent adds. One of the organisers of the referendum, Brigitte Moser Harder, told the BBC she thought the Swiss people agreed with the proposals because the gap between rich and poor had become wider. ""From the beginning, 2006, we had the support of the people of Switzerland because you know not everybody in Switzerland is rich. ""It's also a social problem because the high wages got higher and the small ones sometimes just got lower. I think people have the support of the Swiss people because of that."" Meanwhile, under an EU deal agreed last week by the bloc's 27 nations, bonuses will be capped at a year's salary, but can rise to two year's pay if there is explicit approval from shareholders. The UK argued the EU bonus rules would drive away talent and restrict growth in the financial sector.","Swiss voters have overwhelmingly backed proposals to impose some of the world's strictest controls on executive pay, final referendum results show."
"A service at the Occupation Tapestry Gallery and the Lighthouse Memorial, on which the 21 people are named, was held to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Dr Gilly Carr, from the University of Cambridge, was the main speaker and paid tribute to how islanders helped each other survive Nazi persecution. She said some were treated more harshly because of their British nationality. The 21 residents include some who had been released, but died due to the treatment they received during their time of imprisonment. They had been imprisoned for various reasons including spreading anti-German news - including those who illegally kept radios - attempting to escape the island and sheltering escaped slave workers. Dr Carr said Canon Clifford Cohu, who had been the rector of St Saviour, was a target of abuse, being beaten and called an ""English swine"". Dr Carr said Gerald Domaille, who survived and wrote his memoirs, said he was denied extra food because he was British and was treated like ""scum"". On her theme of helping each other she quoted Mr Domaille's memoirs when he spoke about being hit hard on his right ankle by the butt of a German rifle, possibly breaking it, during a forced march so he had great difficulty in walking. He wrote: ""Norman [Dexter] was great, he helped all the while … it was at this stage we found Walter [Laine] and another fellow named Sidney [Ashcroft]. Now there were four of us to help each other. Singly, I do not think any of us would have survived."" Holocaust Memorial Day was celebrated on 27 January as the camps at Auschwitz in Poland, where millions died, were liberated on this day in 1945.",Wreaths have been laid to remember the 21 Jersey residents who died in Nazi prisons and concentration camps.
"A wild Murakami chase Known for his pensive philosophical novels, Murakami is Japan's most internationally renowned author right now. For years, many in Japan have hoped he would clinch the biggest prize in literature, and waiting for the Nobel announcement has become an annual, and heavily reported, ritual. Cue the ""Harukists"" - acolytes who would gather across the country to peruse their dog-eared copies of Murakami's books, sip on whisky (a motif in his writing) with jazz playing in the background (also a motif), all under the spotlight of television cameras. At one such gathering on Thursday night at a Tokyo shrine, about 200 ""Harukists"", surrounded by reporters, readied their celebratory party poppers in anticipation, while watching a livestream of the announcement. But it was not to be - British writer Kazuo Ishiguro was declared the winner instead. A chorus of sighs erupted from the crowd which, after a beat, burst into polite applause, reported newspaper Mainichi Shimbun. It was slightly more embarrassing for staff at Tokyo's flagship Kinokuniya bookshop, who had lovingly laid out more than 30 titles of Murakami's books in a special display. After they let out a loud surprised ""Ohhh"", staff quickly dismantled their Murakami corner and replaced it with their handful of copies of Ishiguro's books while rushing to order more, according to Asahi Shimbun. Meanwhile, Ishiguro's Japanese publisher tweeted (in Japanese): ""We're all flustered."" On the Nobel Prize Committee's Facebook page, some were quick to make a dig at Murakami fans. Always a bridesmaid, never a bride Murakami's yearly non-win has now become something of a running joke to the rest of the Japanese public - many say autumn hasn't started in Japan if Murakami hasn't lost once again. ""When Haruki Murakami loses out on the Nobel literature prize and Harukists around the country all fall to their knees in disappointment, I feel autumn has come,"" joked one Twitter user yesterday. How did Murakami conquer the world? Murakami is part of a select club of bestselling or critically lauded artists who, despite repeat nominations or wide speculation, have failed to win the top prizes in their industry. These include actors Amy Adams and the late Peter O'Toole (though he did get an honorary Oscar), as well as singers Björk and Katy Perry. But cheer up Murakami fans, hope springs eternal - after all, Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar last year after a 23-year wait. But it's still okay right, because the Nobel winner's Japanese... or is he? Ishiguro, a British citizen who writes in English, was born in Japan and moved to the UK when he was five. Still, that hasn't stopped some in Japan from claiming him as their own. The newspaper Sankei proclaimed him the ""third Japan-born literary laureate"", after Yasunari Kawabata and Kenzaburo Oe. Meanwhile other outlets have zoomed in on how Ishiguro - who has written two books linked to Japan - has talked about the importance of his Japanese identity. Bookshop owner Tasuku Saito told Nikkan Sports he was disappointed by Murakami's loss, but added he accepted Ishiguro's win as it's ""someone with Japanese blood in him"". But it's also sparked a backlash online, where some have criticised the double standards in embracing a Japanese raised abroad, given recent controversies over mixed-race citizens such as politician Renho. ""Kazuo Ishiguro was raised in Britain and has British citizenship, but we call him the third Japanese laureate. On the other hand... Renho, who was born and raised in Japan and has Japanese citizenship, we look down upon her.... Japan is a shameful country,"" said Twitter user 1957ry. Reporting by the BBC's Yuko Kato and Tessa Wong",And this year's Nobel Prize for literature goes to... someone who's not Haruki Murakami again. The BBC delves into the dejected world of his long-suffering fans whose sole desire - to see the Japanese writer win the prize - is thwarted every year.
"Earnings rose by 2.2% in June 2013 compared with the same time last year. In the year to June, the retail price index, which is a measure of inflation, went up by 1.5%. Senator Francis Le Gresley, minister for social security, said it was an encouraging sign for the economy. He said: ""We have seen this turnaround of wage increases being above RPI which means people are better able to afford the cost of every day services and supplies."" The agriculture industry saw the largest increase in average earnings, up 12.7% which has been put down to longer working hours. The average weekly salary for a full-time employee in Jersey was £660 according to the research from the States Statistics Unit. Average earnings by sector ranged from £380 per week in hotels, restaurants and bars and £400 per week in Agriculture to £860 per week in the public sector and £920 per week in financial services. The report found the cost of living had only been higher than the average earnings increase seven times in the past 23 years. Senator Le Gresley said this was a case of the situation going back to normal.","Average pay rises were higher than increases in the price of goods and services for the first time in four years, according to Jersey's government."

"The alleged sightings were in the Fountainstown, Crosshaven and Togher areas. Gardaí (Irish police) have received no official reports of sightings but animal welfare experts said the claims are ""too credible to ignore"". The Cork Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (CSPCA) said it has received several reports of a puma. Speaking to Irish national broadcaster RTÉ, Vincent Cashman of the CSPCA said that while it sounds far fetched, it is not impossible that a puma could be on the loose. Mr Cashman said that a number of people had described the animal as being the size of a labrador dog but with a much longer tail. Traps set A number of live traps and trail cameras have been set up following the sightings and the CSPCA was currently trying to map areas where the animal has been spotted. A puma, also known as a cougar, has been described as a ""large mountain cat"" that holds the potential to be dangerous if cornered. They can also pose a risk to livestock and other animals since they can consume an animal ""as large as a deer"". Since the puma is prone to staying solitary, members of the public have been advised not to go out looking for the mountain cat. The CSPCA has vets on standby, who may be summoned if the animal needs to be darted. Mr Cashman added that CSPCA's ultimate goal is to trap the animal, but thinks it will be a while before they can.",Unconfirmed puma sightings have been reported over the past two weeks in County Cork.
"One of its planes needs a replacement wing costing £500,000. An Aurigny spokeswoman said the work could not be considered until the result of a public service obligation (PSO), launched in 2018, was known. She said the airline needed ""certainty"" on the future of the Alderney routes before progressing with the work. The PSO tender was originally launched in October 2018, but no bids were selected and it was re-launched earlier this year with a result expected early next year. Aurigny currently serves the Alderney-Guernsey and Alderney-Southampton route with three of its four Dorniers after G-SAYE stopped flying in April. The lifespan of the wings is determined by the number of take off and landings. The spokeswoman said: ""G-LGIS has around 300 landings remaining."" ""Without certainty over the future of the PSO or further financial commitment we will only be able to provide a two-aircraft operation from early 2020,"" she added. ""Understandably, we do not wish to commit to this significant expenditure without further confirmation and funding from the States."" The re-winging is described as ""extensive engineering and design work"" that would take four to six months to complete. The spokeswoman said it already had ""a 'donor' wing and the expertise on hand"".","Only two planes will be available to fly on the Alderney routes from early 2020, Guernsey States-owned airline Aurigny has said."
"By James BadcockMadrid Using the hashtag #cuéntalo (tell it), tens of thousands of women have decided to show their solidarity with the victim in the ""wolf pack"" case, so called because of the name of the WhatsApp group her attackers used to comment on their sordid acts. WARNING: You may find some of the accounts in this story disturbing. Women have detailed instances in which they have suffered unwanted sexual attention or violent abuse from male family members, strangers or teachers and others in positions of authority. The stories have trickled in to form a flood of anger about what women have had to endure, mostly in silence - until now. ""It was my father and it started before I can remember,"" wrote Elisa. ""Two years old, three? Less? I have just turned 41 and a few months ago I went back into therapy because, even if I think I have, I haven't got over it. Chronic depression, anxiety attacks, nightmares… I never had a partner. Alone I feel safe."" ""When I was 12 a stranger masturbated on me on the city bus taking me home. I didn't move. I felt shame, guilt, disgust. I didn't tell anyone until years later. I lived as if it hadn't happened but I didn't wear a skirt again for years. It's the first one I remember."" ""I was 13 when my teacher started touching me without my consent and he did it for three months, I was living through a depression and tried suicide, I am telling this because I am not scared anymore."" Famous voices When the five ""wolf pack"" men were handed nine-year jail sentences for sexual abuse but acquitted of full-blown rape last Thursday, hundreds of thousands of mainly women protesters thronged the streets of Spanish cities. Spanish journalist Cristina Fallarás took her cue from the #MeToo movement, posting her own multiple experiences of abuse on Twitter and encouraging other women to #cuéntalo. ""I believe almost all of us have suffered some kind of sexual assault,"" she wrote. Some well-known female personalities in Spain have joined their voices to the movement, like Leticia Dolera, an actress and author, who tweeted her experience of being 15 in a quiet street. ""15 years old. A quiet street. A young man throws himself at me from behind and gropes my bum. He whispers: you're lovely. I am speechless. He goes away. He comes back, doing the same but harder grabbing my hips and rubbing himself up against me. I scream. He goes away. Two people look at me. I feel shame."" Victoria Rosell, a judge and former member of Congress for the anti-austerity Podemos party, tweeted fragments of the 12 times she said she had faced abusive situations. ""Among the 12 occasions I remembered yesterday because of Cristina's #cuéntalo, I have an identical one to yours, at the age of 14. In the clubhouse toilet at a village party, opening the door to three men getting naked. 17. I am not telling about the times that I couldn't escape. It's painful to say: I am a judge and I never went to the police."" Ms Rosell has also criticised her colleagues' verdict in the ""wolf pack"" case. Two of the three judges decided that actual intimidation had not taken place, even though they recognised that the 18-year-old victim had ""frozen"" once being surrounded inside a tiny alcove while her hair was pulled and body moved around by her attackers. ""The proven facts of the case are those of a rape,"" she told Cadena Ser radio after the verdict had been published. Calls for reform The Spanish government has promised to revise the framing of the country's rape laws, with opposition parties also supporting the need for reform. Justice Minister Rafael Catalá took the unusual step of personally criticising the third judge in the case, who issued a minority verdict in favour of acquitting the five of any violent offence, claiming the sex had been consensual. Mr Catalá said Judge Ricardo González was suffering from a ""personal problem"" and said it was the responsibility of Spain's judicial watchdog to ensure judges were ""in full possession of their faculties"". Hours after the third straight night of protests against the verdict had taken place in Pamplona, a 34-year-old woman suffered a fatal beating in the city of Burgos, leading to the arrest of her 36-year-old former boyfriend. Some of the #cuéntalo messages focused on what feminist campaigners in Spain have described as a ""femicide"", after almost 1,000 women have been killed by partners or ex-partners since the government began keeping records of gender violence cases in 2003. Blogger Alejandra Tuk tweeted about the shocking story of a woman killed in Granada in 1997. Her name was Ana Orantes. ""My husband abuses me. I ask for a divorce. The sentence obliges me to live on the second floor of my attacker's house. I tell my story on TV. He gets annoyed because I report it, he comes round, ties me to a chair and burns me alive. I am telling you because Ana Orantes cannot.""",Outrage amongst women in Spain over a court's decision to clear five men of the crime of rape after they performed and filmed non-consensual sex with a teenager has led to an extraordinary outpouring of personal stories of male abuse on social media.
"The letter will be auctioned this weekend, and is expected to fetch up to 80,000 euros (£65,000; $100,000). The emperor wrote it in March 1816 from exile on the island of Saint Helena. He was determined to learn the language of his British captors, but the letter shows he had not quite the mastery he would have liked, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris. The yellowed sheet of paper is one of three written from St Helena, where Napoleon lived in exile after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Just after arriving there, Napoleon started daily English lessons given by his aide, Emmanuel, the Comte de las Cases. Boredom was a spur, as well as a desire to understand what was being communicated around him. The ex-emperor was a keen student, and soon, when he could not sleep at night, he took to writing short letters to his teacher. His prose is not always easy for modern English speakers to understand. ""Count Las Case. It is two o'clock after midnight, I have enow [enough] sleep, I go then finish the night into to cause with you,"" begins the letter . It goes on: ""He shall land above seven day, a ship from Europe that we shall give account from anything who this shall have been even to day of first January thousand eight hundred sixteen.

"After New Democracy's landslide victory on Sunday, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not fail to ""honour the hopes"" of the Greek people. The win comes four years after Alexis Tsipras's leftist Syriza party swept to power promising an end to austerity. But voters began to turn on Syriza after it accepted tough fiscal measures in return for an international bailout. Unemployment and a shrinking economy further damaged support. In the election, Mr Tsipras's Syriza came second, with just 31.53% of the vote so far, according to official figures released after almost all districts returned their results. New Democracy, meanwhile, has won 39.85% so far, which would give them an outright majority as the winner receives 50 extra seats in parliament. Mr Mitsotakis - the son of former Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis - said the result gave him a strong mandate for change, but added he would be a prime minister for all, because Greeks were ""too few to stay divided"". The prime minister, who was sworn in at a ceremony on Monday, has promised lower taxes, greater privatisation of public services and plans to renegotiate a deal with Greece's creditors that would allow more money to be reinvested in the country. ""I want to see this people prosper. I want to see the children who left to return,"" he told supporters. Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker congratulated Mr Mitsotakis on his ""clear victory"". Too many promises Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens Back in 2015, Alexis Tsipras seemed like the figure of change. In his firebrand rallies, the left-wing populist vowed to tear up Greece's bailout programme and end austerity. But he hopelessly overpromised. Under pressure from the EU, capital controls on its banks and the threat of ""Grexit"" - departure from the euro - he was forced into a humiliating U-turn, signing up to a third, €89bn (£80bn; $100bn) bailout, and more austerity. His support base began to ebb away. As the Mitsotakis era begins, one of Europe's iconic leftist leaders of the past four years departs the stage. But he'll regroup in opposition and wait in the wings to seize on any misstep by Greece's new leader. Speaking as the results became clear, Mr Tsipras confirmed he had called Mr Mitsotakis to offer him his congratulations. ""Today, with our head held high we accept the people's verdict. To bring Greece to where it is today we had to take difficult decisions [with] a heavy political cost,"" Mr Tsipras told journalists. Turnout in the election was about 57% – one of the lowest figures in decades. Voting is technically compulsory in the country, though the rule is not enforced. What happened to Syriza's support? Prime Minister Tsipras called the elections after suffering defeat in the local and European votes in May. He had toppled New Democracy from power by campaigning against the austerity policies that had affected Greeks for years. Yet within months, he was forced to accept tough conditions in return for Greece's third international bailout. Mr Tsipras faced a revolt from within his party as a result and responded by calling fresh elections, which he won. But Mr Mitsotakis was able to attack his rival's record, saying that economic improvement was too slow. He also benefited from widespread anger at a landmark deal with North Macedonia over the name of the country - which it shares with a Greek region. What is the state of the Greek economy? What is New Democracy promising? The party has been elected vowing to ""kick start"" the economy, with Mr Mitsotakis telling news agency AFP growth would be boosted ""by private investments, exports and innovation"". New Democracy has also promised to lower taxes and privatise services in the country. Mr Mitsotakis has argued for cutting corporation tax and pledged to reduce youth unemployment - which has averaged 30% for more than 20 years. New Democracy counts many 18-24 year olds among its supporters, so solving this particular crisis could prove Mr Mitsotakis' biggest test. His promise to renegotiate Greece's fiscal targets with creditors is also likely to have proved popular in a country where there is lingering discontent over the measures imposed in exchange for the bailout. How did other parties fare? The centre-left Movement for Change is on 8.1%, followed by the Communist Party on 5.3%. The far-right Golden Dawn party is short of the 3% minimum needed to enter parliament by the narrowest of margins - at 2.93%. The nationalist pro-Russian Greek Solution and MeRA25, the left-wing party of former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, both crossed the threshold. Greek media also report a ballot box was stolen by an unidentified group which had forced its way into one polling station.","Greece's new centre-right prime minister has vowed the country will ""proudly raise its head again""."
"Speaking at the White House, he told reporters he started taking the malaria and lupus medication recently. ""I'm taking it for about a week and a half now and I'm still here, I'm still here,"" was his surprise announcement. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can fight coronavirus, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems. Dr Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization - part of the World Health Organization (WHO) - has also since stressed that no clinical trials have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus. What did Trump say? The 73-year-old president was hosting a meeting devoted to the struggling restaurant industry on Monday, when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. ""You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,"" he told reporters. ""I happen to be taking it."" Asked what was his evidence of hydroxychloroquine's positive benefits, Mr Trump said: ""Here's my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it."" He added: ""I've heard a lot of good stories [about hydroxychloroquine] and if it's not good, I'll tell you right I'm not going to get hurt by it."" Though some people in the White House have tested positive for coronavirus, the president said again on Monday he had ""zero symptoms"" and was being tested frequently. He added that he had been taking a daily zinc supplement and received a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. When asked whether the White House physician had recommended he start taking the disputed remedy, Mr Trump said he himself had requested it. Dr Sean Conley, physician to the president, said in a statement issued through the White House later on Monday that Mr Trump was in ""very good health"" and ""symptom-free"". The US Navy officer added: ""After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" What have US health officials said? The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month issued an advisory saying that hydroxychloroquine has ""not been shown to be safe and effective"". It cited reports that the drug can cause serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients. The FDA warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug are also under way. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there are no approved drugs or therapeutics to prevent or treat Covid-19, which is confirmed to have infected more than 1.5 million people in the US, killing more than 90,000 patients. Is Trump misguided or a trailblazer? I'll have what President Trump's having. No thanks - or rather, not yet. Currently there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine helps fight the virus and it can cause unpleasant and harmful side effects in some people. In theory, repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus is a very good and sound idea (unlike Mr Trump's previous ones about injecting disinfectant or hitting the body with ""tremendous"" UV light). It may be our only hope, at least in the short term, until a vaccine can be found. The UK government has been stockpiling some medicines that might be useful against coronavirus. That includes 16m hydroxychloroquine tablets. Clinical trials are under way in the UK and the US to assess the drug's worth. The human guinea pigs taking part include frontline healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to the virus, as well as patients. Experts agree that this work is worth doing, but they are concerned about advocating more general use of these experimental treatments before the proof is in. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, told me: ""People that follow the president's example might not only endanger themselves but could also deprive patients with chronic autoimmune conditions of their much-needed medication."" What else did Trump say? Dismissing reports of severe side effects from hydroxychloroquine, the president said: ""All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK."" He said the ""only negative"" he had heard was from a ""very unscientific report"" conducted by ""people that aren't big Trump fans"". Mr Trump was apparently referring to a preliminary study from April of Covid-19 patients in US government-run hospitals for military veterans that suggested hydroxychloroquine had no benefit and may have even caused a greater rate of deaths. ""I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy,"" the president told reporters, adding: ""What do you have to lose?"" According to doctors, the drug has the potential to cause symptoms including heart failure, suicidal thoughts and signs of liver disease. What's the reaction? Mr Trump's most powerful elected antagonist, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, could not resist taking a dig at his age and weight when asked on CNN about him taking the malaria medication. ""He's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group - morbidly obese, they say,"" she said. Last year, the White House physician noted in Mr Trump's annual medical exam that he weighed 243lb (110kg) and was 6ft 3in, which would score his body mass index at a technically obese 30.4. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mr Trump's decision ""reckless"" but added: ""Who knows if it's true?"" ""He may not have been taking it for all we know. He just likes to make a splash,"" he told MSNBC. ""Maybe he's really not taking it,"" he continued, ""because the president lies about things characteristically-like.""","US President Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, despite public health officials warning it may be unsafe."
"Russian energy giant Gazprom - one of the world's largest natural gas suppliers - said it was unilaterally severing its contracts with Ukraine. Gazprom made the announcement after a Stockholm court ruled against it at the end of a long-running legal battle. Ukraine is also a major channel for gas piped to the European Union. EU officials in Brussels voiced concern about the supply of gas to the bloc at a time of freezing weather across much of the continent. Gazprom's refusal to deliver its fuel resulted in conservation measures across Ukraine, where heavy snowfall has caused travel chaos in Kiev and other cities. The government has told power stations to switch to fuel oil generation where possible. The energy ministry recommended that educational institutions close until next week at the earliest, though each area will make the decision itself. The dispute between Gazprom and Ukraine dates back years. Ukraine's national gas company Naftogaz said it was owed compensation for a lack of agreed supply and for transit fees through the country's pipelines. Gazprom, meanwhile, claimed that Naftogaz had not paid it fully for the gas it agreed to buy. The ruling by a Swedish court this week - designed to end the dispute - found the calculations of who owed what came out in Ukraine's favour by $2.56bn (£1.86bn). But on Thursday, Gazprom did not resume supplies, reportedly returning a payment Kiev had made in advance. It has also asked a court to unilaterally annul its contracts. Gazprom director Alexei Miller told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that it was ""economically inexpedient and unprofitable to continue with the contracts"" and that his company had no intention to ""solve Ukraine's economic problems at its own expense"". Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he was certain the contracts would remain in effect, and accused the company of ""attempts to use gas supplies as a leverage for political pressure"". This is not the first time that Russia has blocked gas supplies to Ukraine: it cut supplies because of price disputes in 2006, the winter of 2008-09, and again in 2014. The gas dispute has at times been characterised as a proxy for the larger political animosity between the two nations, particularly after the annexation of Crimea by Russian forces in 2014. On Friday, the EU offered to step in and broker a deal if necessary.","Ukraine has told all schools and higher education institutions to close in an effort to save gas, after its Russian supplier refused to deliver more fuel."
"By Gabriel GatehouseBBC News, Bukavu The largest peacekeeping force in the world, comprising some 17,000 troops, was unable to hold off a relatively small force of mutineers from the Congolese army. Many at the UN believe the rebel movement, which calls itself M23, has been receiving help from Rwanda. The Rwandan government denies backing the rebels. But the BBC has heard evidence that suggests Rwanda's support for the growing rebellion in the eastern DR Congo may be more widespread than previously thought. The city of Bukavu lies on the southern tip of Lake Kivu, some 200km (125 miles) to the south of Goma. There we met two young men, from DR Congo's minority Tutsi ethnic group, who told us about how the rebel movement they had joined had recently been given money by Rwanda. ""We got it [the money] from the Rwanda government,"" Captain Okra Rudahirwa told us. ""They sent money every month, like $20,000 [£12,500], or sometimes $15,000."" With the money they were able to buy food, uniforms and medicines. 'Instructions' The two men had both been in the Congolese army at one stage, but had left of their own accord and gone to study in Uganda. There in 2010 they had joined the political wing of a group, the Congolese Movement for Change, which was fighting for a better life for the people of eastern DR Congo. Only in July did they go into the bush with its armed wing to fight the Congolese army. Capt Rudahirwa and his colleague, Col Bestfriend Ndozi, thought they were part of a home-grown movement. ""Then our chairman came with a delegation from the government of Rwanda, saying that the movement has been changed, that we had to follow the instructions of the Rwanda government,"" Capt Rudahirwa said. Col Ndozi said the group, which consisted of around 35 men, was then put in contact with a senior M23 commander, a Col Manzi. He urged them to co-ordinate with M23 in order to open up a second front against the Congolese army. ""Manzi told us that the Rwandan army had given him the authority to support us and to command us,"" Col Ndozi said. ""He ordered us to continue our fight, just as M23 were doing in the north, so that together we would demoralise the government."" The men said they decided to abandon the fight once they realised the scale of Rwandan involvement. Now they say they are in the process of re-integrating into the Congolese army. The Rwandan government declined to comment on the allegations. But many of the details of this account, including dates and the names of intermediaries, tally with separate research conducted by the UN. After the Rwandan genocide in 1994, many of the killers who masterminded the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus fled across the border into DR Congo. Since then, Rwanda has invaded its much larger neighbour on at least two occasions. The FDLR, as the extremist Hutu militia is now known, is still active, though it no longer represents a serious threat to Rwandan national security. But less than 20 years since the genocide, that apocalyptic event continues to a large extent to inform the Rwandan government's world view, from its intolerance of dissent at home, to its desire to exert some control over the chaos on its western border. And so the conflict is spreading. Rape rising Instability breeds lawlessness, armed groups operate with near impunity, and civilians bear the brunt. At a centre for the victims of sexual violence in Bukavu, they told us instances of rape were on the rise. Eme, not her real name, was assaulted in July. ""I was on my way to the farm,"" she remembered. ""I saw two young men. One had a gun and was wearing a military uniform,"" she said. ""He said he had been in the bush without sex for so long. ""Then he raped me. When he had finished he handed me over to his colleague. ""I told them: 'I'm sick', but they just carried on."" Some of the victims at the hospital are as young as six years old. A woman in her seventies was also recently brought in. One woman told us: ""We are all afraid. Since July, the rapes have started again."" Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. This fight, between the rebels and the loyalist army, is essentially a struggle between armed groups. It is a tussle over territory and access to the lucrative mineral trade. It is a fight from which very few stand to benefit, aside from the men with the guns themselves and the politicians, Congolese and foreign, who control them.",The fall of Goma was an embarrassing moment for the United Nations peacekeepers in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
"The resort will have ski runs, ski lifts, resort chalets and sleigh rides. But its two hotels are little more than empty shells, while the access road is filled with potholes, the AP news agency reported after a visit to the site in September. There are also questions about who will use the resort once it is completed. It is estimated that there are only about 5,500 North Korean skiers in a country with a population of 24 million people - equivalent to about 0.02% of the total. Correspondents say that the Masik Pass ski resort - located in the secluded depths of North Korea's east coast - is the country's latest megaproject, the product of 10 months of intensive labour. It is intended to show that Communist North Korea is as civilized and culturally advanced as any other country, despite its reputation for poverty and isolation. Billboards around the construction site urge workers to finish the job by Thursday's deadline, the 68th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers' Party. But the construction has reportedly been delayed by heavy rains and landslides. ""Full attack. March forward. Let's absolutely finish building Masik Pass ski resort within this year by launching a full aggressive war,"" one sign reads. The resort is believed to be a pet project of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who reportedly skied when he attended secondary school in Switzerland under an assumed name. An AP reporter who recently visited Masik's ski runs says that they consist of long stretches of bright-brown dirt dotted with rocks, weeds and patches of stubborn grass. The pistes cut their way through the trees to converge at the hotel construction site below. Foundations were still being dug. Two simple lifts were being installed, but neither was working at the time. Correspondents say that North Korea is eager to build the resort because it wants to win more medals in the Winter Olympics. Sport is seen as a useful way of mobilising the masses and Pyongyang wants to encourage more tourism. ""It will have a big impact on the economy,"" North Korean Academy of Social Science economist Ri Ki Song told AP. ""We are now trying to build a lot of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed countries enjoy. It will also be a place for our own people to use.''","North Korea was due to open its first multi-million dollar ski resort on Thursday, but there are doubts whether it will be ready in time."
"He is wanted for questioning in neighbouring Belize in connection with the death of his neighbour, Florida businessman Gregory Faull, last month. Mr McAfee was arrested on Wednesday for entering Guatemala illegally and is now expected to be deported to Belize. Guatemala's president said his country had the right to grant or deny asylum as it saw fit. President Otto Perez Molina told a news conference that no explanation was needed as Guatemala was simply complying with the law. ""If he comes from Belize after the murder of his neighbour, it doesn't give us the impression that there's any kind of political persecution but that there is a fear of the ongoing investigation,"" the president said. ""So we're not going to allow people who are trying to flee an investigation to come here to Guatemala."" Mr McAfee, who maintains his innocence, was taken to hospital in Guatemala City complaining of chest pains. He was later released from hospital and taken away in a police car. His lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, said his client had been found to be suffering from stress and an over-rapid heartbeat. Mr McAfee says he fled Belize because he was being ""harassed"" by police, saying earlier this week that the country ""does not have a good track record of providing safety when they ask to question you"". There is no international warrant for his arrest. Mr McAfee posted a plea to the Guatemalan leader on his blog: ""Please email the President of Guatemala and beg him to allow the court system to proceed, to determine my status in Guatemala, and please support the political asylum that I am asking for."" Mr Guerra told local radio: ""We are going to go to the human rights prosecutor to lodge a complaint and file an injunction against the foreign minister for detaining him without studying his asylum request."" Bubble gum disguise Belize officials say McAfee is a ""person of interest"" in the murder of Mr Faull on 11 November. He was arrested on Wednesday at a hotel in an affluent area of the capital, Guatemala City, having managed to cross the Belize border the day before. The 67-year-old revealed that in order to go unnoticed, he changed his appearance by dying his hair and beard, sticking chewed bubble gum to his upper gums to fatten his face and staining his teeth. Gregory Faull's Belize home sits next to Mr McAfee's compound on a tropical island. He was found dead with a single gunshot to the head. Mr McAfee is known to have had a long-running row with Mr Faull over the guard dogs protecting the software maker's compound. He denies any involvement in the businessman's death and says he went into hiding so he could stay close to his Belize home and conduct his own investigation into Mr Faull's death, adding that he had little faith that the island's police would find the murderer. In an interview with US TV station NBC, Mr McAfee offered a reward of $25,000 (£15,700) for the capture of the ""person or persons"" behind the killing. McAfee has led an eccentric life since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that bears his name in the early 1990s. He moved to Belize about three years ago seeking lower taxes and has lived in semi-seclusion on a heavily guarded compound until recently.","John McAfee, the founder of anti-virus software which bears his name, has been refused asylum in Guatemala."
"The San Francisco 49er's quarterback stayed seated as The Star-Spangled Banner played in a pre-game ceremony in protest against what he called the oppression of black people in the US. The gesture has provoked a huge reaction, with some applauding him as principled, others seeing him as disrespectful and unpatriotic. Here are some of the key responses. #VeteransForKaepernick rally behind athlete An often-repeated criticism of Kaepernick has been that his actions are offensive to members of the US military. Guidelines say all Americans should stand and face the flag during the anthem - by not doing so, as the argument goes, Kaepernick was insulting people prepared to die for it. Some former servicemen and women disagree, however, and have been offering their support using the #VeteransForKaepernick hashtag. However backing for Kaepernick among the US military is far from unanimous. In one widely shared response, Senior Airman Brian Kolfage, who lost three limbs in Iraq in 2004, said ""I'll be sure to stand for the both us"" next time the anthem played. Meanwhile the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States group said ""the American flag and our national anthem stand for something, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States salutes all who stand with us"". Fans burn quarterback's shirt Angry fans of the 49ers have been posting videos of themselves burning Kaepernick jerseys. ""When you don't rise for the flag to show your respect for the men and women who fought and continue to fight for our freedom you start #losing #fans,"" wrote one. Kaepernick led San Francisco to the 2013 Super Bowl, but since then his status in the team has declined and he has lost his starting place. His team support his protest, saying ""we recognise the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem"". Mexico Olympics athlete weighs in One man who knows what it is like to be attacked for making a political gesture at a sporting event is Tommie Smith, the US sprinter who famously raised his fist in protest against racial discrimination during his gold medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics. Smith gave Kaepernick his backing. ""He's being vilified in how he brings the truth out,"" he told USA Today. ""I support him because he's bringing the truth out, regardless of how done. If it's not done violently, at least he should be heard."" He suggested that Kaepernick was only continuing a fight against systemic racism that was yet to be won. ""There are a lot of battles to fight because it's a big, long war,"" he said. Donald Trump enters the fray The Republican presidential nominee gave a typically forthright response, calling Kaepernick's action a ""terrible thing"". ""Maybe he should find a country that works better for him,"" Mr Trump told KIRO radio in Seattle. ""Let him try. It won't happen."" There has been no word yet from rival Hillary Clinton. Kaepernick himself is no fan of either candidate. Asked whether he had deliberately timed the protest to coincide with election year, he said both ""represent the issue that we have in this country right now"". He went onto call Mr Trump ""openly racist"" and cited Mrs Clinton's description of black children as ""super-predators"". 'All Lives Matter' rears its head In his reaction, Jerry Rice, who won three Super Bowl championships while with the 49ers, took a similar line to many, backing Kaepernick's freedom to express himself while disagreeing with the method. But three little words made Rice himself come under fire. The phrase ""All Lives Matter"" has proved hugely toxic, with critics saying those who use the phrase are at best missing the point of the debate, at worst being outright racist. Kaepernick has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and referenced police brutality in explaining his action. Digging through the history books The row has triggered a complex debate about free speech and patriotism, the sport and the military, and for some commentators was a chance to examine the meaning of the Star Spangled Banner itself. The anthem is best known for its opening verse, which is normally the only one sung. It was written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, after witnessing the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore. But a lesser known third verse, which has the line ""no refuge could save the hireling and slave"" is often interpreted as celebrating the deaths of slaves who died siding with the British. Writing in the Root, Jason Johnson calls the song ""one of the most racist, pro-slavery, anti-black songs in the American lexicon"".","When American football player Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, he unleashed a storm of controversy that shows no sign of dying down."
"The Asian hornet has been positively identified by States of Guernsey experts and sent for genetic testing. The first sightings of Asian hornets in the Channel Islands were in Alderney in July last year, and then Jersey in August. The public are advised to photograph and report the ""aggressive predator"" of honey bees if spotted. The hornet found in Sark measured 22mm (just under 1in) and beekeepers in the Channel Islands have been notified. Identifying an Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) Vespa velutina queens are up to 3cm (1.2in) in length; workers up to 25mm (1in) Entirely dark brown or black velvety body, bordered with a fine yellow band Only one band on the abdomen: 4th abdominal segment almost entirely yellow/orange Legs brown with yellow ends Head black with an orange-yellow face Source: National Bee Unit The Guernsey Beekeeping Association has advised its members to increase vigilance and monitoring of bee hives through the use of hornet traps. Anyone spotting what they believe to be Asian hornet is recommended to watch it long enough to determine the direction of travel as this may be helpful in finding a nest site. As with wasps and bees, the hornets have a painful sting so people should avoid direct contact and never attempt to disturb a hornets' nest.",A hornet which can kill up to 50 bees a day has been found in Sark in the Channel Islands for the first time.
"The campaign, which first began in March last year, focuses on speeding, drinking and driving, seatbelts and using mobile phones while driving. In 2012 there were 115 crashes in which bike riders and cyclists were hurt, compared to 121 in 2011. Police said they were still concerned about the figures. Of the 115 crashes, 24 were classed as serious. Road safety officer Philip Blake said the campaign would place extra emphasis on the safety of motorbikes and cyclists. It will involve school talks about bike maintenance, leaflets on road safety and a cartoon police bike which will feature on social media and the force's website.",A road safety campaign has been launched again in Jersey to focus on motorbikes and cyclists after concern over the number of crashes.
"Deputy Allister Langlois said he wanted discussions with Treasury and Resources to take place over a change to the collection of taxes in Guernsey. But he said a short-term rise in contribution rates would be counter-productive. Deputies in 2011 agreed to a total budget of £361.8m for the year for States departments and committees. Mr Langlois said: ""The danger of trying to close that gap immediately through the contributions system is that the only place it sensibly or fairly could go would be mainly on the employers' contribution and that could have direct effects on the competitiveness of business.""","An £8.9m deficit will be dealt with, according to Guernsey's social security minister."
"By Gemma HandyBasseterre, St Kitts The Caribbean island's green vervet monkeys are as iconic as its historic fortresses and black sand beaches. But the charismatic creatures that so enthral holidaymakers cause misery for local farmers, munching their way through every crop from mangoes and watermelons to squash and cucumber. So indiscriminate are their taste buds, research indicates three in four of the country's farms are now affected. Balancing tourism, which accounts for almost two-thirds of the country's GDP, against the need to feed the human population, is a peculiar dichotomy. Monkeys are not native to St Kitts, or its sister isle Nevis where they also thrive, and were likely brought here by 17th Century early settlers as exotic pets. Numbers have exploded in recent years since the collapse of the sugar industry which kept them largely confined to the mountains, feeding on cane and culled by rangers. With fruit trees also lost to hurricanes, the monkeys have gradually made their way down from the hills and into residential areas. Not only are they believed to now outnumber their human counterparts with estimates of up to 60,000, they routinely outwit them too. You may also be interested in: Frustrated farmers' attempts to frighten the dexterous simians away from their fruit and veg with scarecrows, rubber snakes and fake birds of prey in mimicry of their natural West African predators are consistently thwarted. ""They soon figure out they're not real,"" sighs director of environment June Hughes. ""I could write a book on how cunning the monkeys are. They test each system and learn very quickly so there's no single method that works. ""Some farmers have tried getting dogs which bark at them and send them away. It works for a while and then one day the farmer gets home to find the monkey petting the dog."" Ms Hughes says the monkeys also ravage indigenous vegetation and wildlife, eating birds' eggs and bromeliads. ""When I was a child it was rare to see a monkey. Now they're everywhere. Tourists see them and think they're so cute. And they are cute but they're also a pest,"" she explains. ""Still, they are interwoven into our culture. Even most farmers say they don't want them gone totally, just off their land and under control."" Farmer Albert Gordon says his pumpkins are regularly looted by monkeys. ""If I see them, I throw a stone and run them off but they come back eventually,"" he tells the BBC. Some islanders have found ways to make a living from the creatures. Local ""monkey men"" charge tourists $5 (£4) each for a photo with the captivating primates. Baby monkeys are occasionally seen tied up at city bars to lure in foreign visitors. Sadly, many have been seized from the wild and, when not entertaining holidaymakers, are often kept caged. Others end up on the dinner table. Colloquially dubbed ""tree mutton"", monkey stew is a local delicacy, although not everyone has the stomach for it. Forest ranger Jourdan Cassius thinks an annual hunting season would help control numbers and provide a cheap source of protein. Managing the ""monkey problem"" is a major theme of a new project by the United Nations Environment Programme aimed at tackling invasive species in the Eastern Caribbean. One initiative planned involves gaining the trust of two troupes of monkeys - one on St Kitts and one on Nevis - from dusk to dawn for an entire year. Those tracking the monkeys will wear the same bright clothes daily so they are easily recognisable by the animals. The idea behind the project is to enable researchers to get a better understanding of monkeys' habits and their impact on local biodiversity, explains its national co-ordinator, biological anthropologist Dr Kerry Dore. ""It might fail but we're going to do our best,"" she says. ""We'll start by talking to villagers who know the monkeys' schedules and asking where they usually see them."" Researchers will also meet hoteliers, monkey men, farmers and families to thoroughly assess the animals' environmental and economic impact, and place cameras in birds' nests to verify if monkeys are indeed stealing eggs. Ultimately, the aim is to gather information to help guide policy-makers. Mass sterilisation of monkeys, while more ""tourist-friendly"" than a mass cull as some suggest, poses practical and financial challenges. ""This isn't like dealing with an overpopulation of rats,"" Dr Dore adds. ""Monkeys are the most sentient and intelligent of the animal kingdom."" Dr Christa Gallagher, a lecturer at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in Basseterre, has been studying St Kitts' monkeys for years. Her work has involved fitting them with GPS collars to gauge their range and interface with humans. ""They're absolutely fascinating. They study us as much as we watch them,"" she says. ""To see their social interactions and the mother-baby bond is incredible."" Dr Gallagher thinks replanting lost fruit trees could help encourage them back into the mountains. ""Monkeys represent amazing biodiversity, they're a natural resource and need to be protected,"" she says, adding: ""Human-animal conflicts exist all over the world. We need to find a way to co-exist harmoniously.""

"The statue outside the American Museum of Natural History in New York shows Roosevelt on horseback flanked by a Native American man and an African man. A great-grandson of the president agreed with the removal, saying it did not reflect Roosevelt's legacy. But President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Ridiculous, don't do it!"" There has been a heated debate in the United States over the appropriateness of certain statues and commemorations since the death in police custody of African American George Floyd. Symbols linked to the US Confederacy, which supported slavery, have been particularly targeted in the US. Monuments to Christopher Columbus, the 15th Century explorer whose voyages on behalf of Spain opened the way for the European colonisation of the Americas, have also been criticised in the US as symbols of imperialism. But the anti-statue campaign, arising from the Black Lives Matter movement, has spread globally, with monuments targeted in a number of countries. What's behind the museum's decision? The statue has stood outside the museum's Central Park West entrance since 1940. Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday: ""The museum has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts black and indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior."" He said he backed the decision, adding it was ""the right time to remove this problematic statue"". The museum's president, Ellen Futter, said the world had become focused on ""statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism"". She said the decision was based on the composition of the statue and not on Roosevelt, whom the museum would continue to honour. A great-grandson of the former president, Theodore Roosevelt IV, told the New York Times: ""The composition of the equestrian statue does not reflect Theodore Roosevelt's legacy. It is time to move the statue and move forward."" Activists opposed to symbols of colonial expansion and racial discrimination have wanted the statue removed for many years. President Trump did not agree, tweeting his opposition early on Monday: At a rally last week, the president condemned ""the unhinged left-wing mob trying to vandalise our history, desecrate our monuments"". It has not yet been announced what will happen to the statue. The legacies of Jefferson and Washington, both slave owners, have been heavily questioned in the recent anti-racism campaign, and even Lincoln's position on slavery is regarded as complicated. Who was Theodore Roosevelt? The Republican was one of the more flamboyant of the country's presidents, serving two terms from 1901-09, and is often ranked in the top five in terms of achievement. But there is no doubt his legacy is complex - a man who won widespread praise for proposals that led towards a welfare state, while also advocating eugenics. He was the first US president to invite a black man - a former slave and presidential adviser Booker T Washington - to dinner at the White House in 1901. The decision enraged southern states. But according to biographer Edmund Morris, Roosevelt also believed black people were ""altogether inferior to whites"" and once remarked they were ""two hundred thousand years behind"" whites. ""Teddy"", as he is known, is one of the four faces on the famous Mount Rushmore monument, where he joins Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.",A bronze statue of former US President Theodore Roosevelt is to be removed amid an ongoing backlash against symbols of racial bias and imperialism.
"By Rob CameronBBC News, Prague Roman Janousek's arrest on Friday came days after a newspaper alleged his influence over politicians and officials in Prague was once so great it virtually made him the city's ""shadow mayor"", selling off city property, rigging public tenders and overseeing huge development projects. The paper called him Voldemort: He Who Must Not Be Named - a billionaire businessman whose influence on communal politics was all-encompassing, yet officially denied. The extent of that alleged influence is still emerging. On Friday, the law finally caught up with Mr Janousek, 43, not on suspicion of bribing officials, or rigging public tenders, or for allegations of laundering millions of dollars through a Swiss bank account, or any of the other allegations of corruption that have surfaced recently in the Czech media. He was arrested and charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm and drink-driving. 'Tarantino movie' Eyewitnesses say he deliberately ran over a woman with his luxury Porsche Cayenne after damaging her car in a minor collision. Pursued by another driver, Roman Janousek eventually abandoned his vehicle and tried to escape on foot. His drunken lope through a scrubby park was captured on CCTV cameras. Local TV crews arrived in minutes, and he slurred his way through a rambled, rather surreal explanation. ""It felt a bit like watching a Tarantino movie,"" says Jindrich Sidlo, a commentator for the leading financial daily, Hospodarske Noviny. ""The sight of this guy running away from the police in a park after almost killing someone in his car... it was incredibly tragicomic. This isn't the way notorious gangsters are supposed to meet their end."" The incident and subsequent arrest came days after a newspaper published transcripts of what it said were intelligence service wire-taps of Mr Janousek's conversations with politicians and city officials, most notably Pavel Bem, who was mayor of Prague between 2002 and 2010. The intelligence services deny the tapes came from them, although an official investigation has now been launched. The conversations are almost humorous for their foul-mouthed banter and incongruous nicknames. Pavel Bem has repeatedly insisted Mr Janousek is a friend and has categorically denied he was involved in any decision-making at City Hall. But the wire-taps suggest Mr Janousek's counsel was sought for everything from the sale of city land to who should run the Prague branch of the country's monolithic state health insurer, VZP. Mr Janousek refuses to speak to the media. 'Under stress' Many, if not most, Praguers have long believed their city is run by a small coterie of super-rich businessmen and corrupt officials, rather than their elected representatives. The transcripts have done nothing to disabuse them of that notion. Not for nothing is Marianske namesti, the small square that houses City Hall, colloquially referred to as ""Mafianske namesti"". High-level corruption and cronyism has, however, been difficult to prove in court. Indeed there seems to be little appetite in high places to ascertain the veracity of the Janousek tapes. President Vaclav Klaus says the wire-taps are ""destroying democracy"". Mr Bem, a serving MP who was once a protege of Mr Klaus, described them as ""demeaning and perverse"". The outrage surrounding Mr Janousek's road-rage incident is likely to subside in time. He said he was ""under stress"", has apologised and offered compensation to the woman, a member of the country's Vietnamese minority. She remains in hospital under police guard. But questions are already being asked about the police handling of Mr Janousek's arrest. He was neither placed in handcuffs nor held in custody despite having attempted to flee the scene. Many Czechs will undoubtedly see that as a symptom of a wider malaise: the existence of a rich and powerful elite who live by a different set of rules. The Porsches, the personalised number plates, the ostentatious villas - for most Czechs, all these are the visible trappings of money earned dishonestly, using political connections and a liberal interpretation of the law. But only now are the citizens of the Czech capital learning the true extent of their influence.",The Czech Republic has been gripped by the case of a controversial lobbyist who faces up to 10 years in prison for deliberately running over a woman with his car while drunk.
"North Korea accused the US of ""luring and pushing"" Otto Warmbier into breaking the country's laws, the foreign ministry said in a statement. The 22-year-old died in June shortly after he was released from a North Korean prison. There was no clear indication that he had been tortured, a coroner said. ""Trump and his clique, for their anti-DPRK propaganda, are again exploiting the death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who had been under reform through labour for the criminal act he committed against the DPRK and died after returning to the US,"" North Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday, referring to its acronym for Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The comments came after an Ohio county coroner had determined Mr Warmbier had died from a lack of oxygen to the brain. The coroner's report contradicts statements made by the US student's parents in a TV interview with Fox on Tuesday. They said North Korea had ""systematically tortured"" their son after he was jailed for stealing a sign during a holiday in Pyongyang in 2016. ""We don't know what happened to him and that's the bottom line,"" Dr Lakshmi Sammarco said in a news conference on Wednesday. Mr Warmbier was convicted of stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel last year. He arrived home in June in a state of ""unresponsive wakefulness"" after he had been released by Pyongyang on medical grounds. North Korea said he contracted botulism shortly after being sentenced, but US doctors have disputed this. 'No evidence of dental trauma' In their interview with Fox and Friends, Fred and Cindy Warmbier said when they first saw him on his return, their son was ""jerking violently"" and made ""inhuman sounds"". They said his arms and legs were ""totally deformed"", he had a scar on his foot that had been an open wound for some time, and his bottom teeth looked ""like someone had taken a pair of pliers"" to them. ""Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured by Kim and his regime,"" said Mr Warmbier. Dr Sammarco conducted an external examination and scans of Mr Warmbier's body - his parents refused a post-mortem. She said she was ""surprised"" by the Warmbiers' statement. ""I felt very comfortable that there wasn't any evidence of trauma"" to the teeth, she told reporters. There were only small scars on his body, including his foot. One of the scars could not be explained. But she said his body and skin were in ""excellent condition"" for someone who had been bedridden for more than a year. She said he died from lack of oxygen and blood to the brain caused by an injury more than year before. Muscle spasms, eye movements and noises can all be consistent with oxygen deprivation. US President Donald Trump had called the Warmbier's appearance ""a great interview"", and said ""Otto was tortured beyond belief"".","US President Donald Trump is an ""old lunatic"", exploiting the death of an American student who died after he was jailed in North Korea, Pyongyang says."
"The remains of 17-year-old Keane Mulready-Woods were found on a road in Coolock on Monday night The body of the teenager, who was reported missing on Sunday night, had been dismembered. Gardaí (Irish police) said the images being shared are unverified, but are distressing to Keane's family. They said if they are verified they ""are disrespectful images of the deceased and provide false support to the perpetrators of this brutal crime"". On Wednesday night gardaí said the remains were those of the teenager who had been reported missing by his family. The discovery of his limbs on Monday night sparked an intensive investigation into organised crime, feuding gangs and murder. Police also believe that human remains found in a burning stolen car at Trinity Lane off Clonliffe Avenue in Ballybough in the early hours of Wednesday morning are those of Keane, but they are waiting on DNA confirmation. Gardaí believe the murder is related to the ongoing feud between two Drogheda criminal gangs, which has now cost three lives. However, investigators said it should be remembered the victim was a child ""trying to find his way in life"". The teenager's body was dismembered as those involved sought to leave his remains at various locations in Dublin and Louth. Gardaí are searching for the clothes Keane was wearing and issued photographs of a similar outfit on their Facebook page. As part of their investigation, gardaí sealed off a house as a crime scene in Rathmullen Park in Drogheda and blocked off the laneway at the back. Specialists are reported to have discovered traces of blood and evidence of an attempt at a clean-up. They are investigating the possibility that the teenager may have been taken and attacked. Three other locations linked to the main figures in both feuding gangs have also been searched.",Police investigating the murder of a County Louth teenager are investigating reports of images and videos circulating on social messaging apps.
"The driver was caught on speed cameras - but his identity was hidden by the bird's wings spread in flight. A light-hearted police statement suggested that perhaps ""it was no coincidence the Holy Spirit"" intervened - a reference to the dove as a symbol of that aspect of God in Christianity. ""We have understood the sign and leave the speeder in peace this time."" But the officials in Viersen, near Germany's western border, added: ""We hope that the protected speeder likewise understands this 'hint from above' and drives appropriately in the future."" The driver was travelling at 54km/h (34mph) on a stretch of road with a 30km/h speed limit, police said. But since only the car, and not the driver, could be identified, he was probably spared the €105 fine ""thanks to the feathered guardian angel with seemingly carefully spread wings"". The Viersen police added that the dove should also have been fined for moving so fast in the restricted zone. ""However, since we do not know where it has to be on time for [the upcoming Christian holy day of] Pentecost, we will allow mercy over justice here too.""",A speeding driver in Germany was saved from a €105 (£93) fine when a snow-white dove interceded on his behalf.
"One of the women had criticised the shutdown of Mumbai in her post, after the death of politician Bal Thackeray, while the other ""liked"" the comment. The women, accused of ""promoting enmity between classes"", were released on bail after appearing in court. The death of the controversial Hindu nationalist politician on Saturday afternoon brought Mumbai to a halt. In her Facebook comment on Sunday, 21-year-old Shaheen Dhanda wrote: ""People like Thackeray are born and die daily and one should not observe a 'bandh' [shutdown] for that."" Her 20-year-old friend Renu Srinivasan 'liked' the status. 'Abuse of authority' The Times of India newspaper responded with the headline: ""Shame: 2 girls arrested for harmless online comment."" The newspaper said the arrests were a ""clear case of abuse of authority"". ""The girl was not slandering anybody, nor was she promoting hatred towards any community"". The newspaper said the charges should be dropped and a case of ""wrongful arrest"" registered against the police. Press Council of India Chairman Markandey Katju has written a letter to the Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan criticising the arrests. ""We are living in a democracy, not a fascist dictatorship. In fact, this arrest itself appears to be a criminal act, since... it is a crime to wrongfully arrest or wrongfully confine someone who has committed no crime,"" Mr Katju, a former Supreme Court judge, said. Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the arrests. ""It is their point of view, and enforcement of these laws are not to ban people from expressing their views,"" he said. In recent months, police have arrested a number of people in cases which are being seen as a test of India's commitment to freedom of speech. In October, Ravi Srinivasan, a 46-year-old businessman in the southern Indian city of Pondicherry, was arrested for a tweet criticising Karti Chidambaram, son of Indian Finance Minister P Chidambaram. He was later released on bail. In September, there was outrage when a cartoonist was jailed in Mumbai on charges of sedition for his anti-corruption drawings. The charges were later dropped. And in April, the West Bengal government arrested a teacher who had emailed to friends a cartoon that was critical of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. He too was later released on bail.",The arrest of two women on Monday over a comment on Facebook has sparked off widespread anger in India.
"By Sophie WilliamsBBC News Now that it has been extinguished, experts have been able to shed light on the difficulties fire crews faced as they fought to save such a large, historic building. A complex, flammable, roof Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, told the BBC that ""what the Paris firefighters did was close to a miracle"". ""It's completely different to most training because all the material burning is the roof,"" he said. The cathedral's roof is a complex piece of carpentry with very thin and very thick columns which are all flammable, he explained. The thin parts ignite first and then ignite thicker wood which burns for a long time. Gregg Favre, former commander at St Louis Fire Department in the US, also pointed out how flammable the building is. He explained on Twitter: ""Let's pause to remember how fires actually burn. You need oxygen, fuel, heat and a chemical chain reaction. Removing the fuel is a no go. Churches have no shortage of things to burn. ""The heat that a fire this size is putting off is tremendous. Little options for interrupting that. The chemical chain is off to the races. That horse left the stable in the first five minutes. ""That leaves the oxygen. Unfortunately, even if the roof had not burnt off, churches are nearly impossible to control ventilation in. Their design is to be open and airy. Great for Sunday worship, terrible for managing fire spread."" Pompiers de Paris, the city's fire brigade, posted a video showing how they tackled the fire. Bob Parkin, a former UK firefighter turned safety consultant, told the BBC that in this case, tackling the blaze from inside was the only option. ""They would have to go inside the building or use aerial appliances, ladders and hydraulic platforms,"" he said. ""But you're putting water on the outside of the building and the only way you sort it is if you attack it from the inside."" Dumping water from above? As the fire burned, US President Donald Trump suggested that flying water tankers could be brought in to fight the flames from above. Professor Rein said he wasn't the first person to come up with the suggestion, however it was ""not a good idea because it would have damaged the structure of the cathedral, collapsing the walls"". The force of water coming from an air tanker is strong and no-one has been trained to use one in a city. He added that Monday's fire was ""not the time to test this"". How safe can they make Notre-Dame? Professor Rein says that ""fire engineering"" will need to be considered when reconstructing the cathedral. Fire engineering is now in place in modern landmarks such as the Shard in London. He said: ""The roof was not protected whatsoever."" Mr Parkin told the BBC that in the future, Notre-Dame should install sprinklers. ""We keep seeing these buildings go up in flames like this and it's relatively easy to prevent,"" he said. ""In this building you've got invaluable artefacts and it's so easy to prevent and that's by installing sprinkler systems. People are still building without them and it keeps happening.""",The main structure of Notre-Dame cathedral - including the two bell towers - has been saved after firefighters worked through the night to tackle the huge blaze.
"CL Max Nikias has agreed to step down, with the university facing several lawsuits and accusations of a cover up. The lawsuits accuse George Tyndall, who worked at a university clinic for 30 years, of sexual misconduct, including groping and improper examinations. Mr Tyndall, 71, has denied any wrongdoing in interviews with US media. 'Improper probing' The USC's board of trustees announced the departure of Mr Nikias in a letter, saying: ""We have heard the message that something is broken and that urgent and profound actions are needed. ""We will rebuild our culture to reflect an environment in which safety and transparency are of paramount importance, and to institute systemic change that will prevent this from occurring in the future."" Some 200 professors had joined students in demanding Mr Nikias, 65, step down. The Tyndall case arose after the Los Angeles Times published accounts from former and current employees about his alleged actions. A number of lawsuits and class actions have now been filed. Two class actions were filed on Friday ""on behalf of thousands of female students"". Lawyer Howard Janet said his team's case ""centres on allegations of grossly improper pelvic exams that involved improper probing, at times without gloves, sexually charged remarks and illicit photographing of genitalia"". Mr Janet was behind the legal action that saw a $190m (£111m) settlement in 2014 at Johns Hopkins Hospital over secret tapes made there by gynaecologist Nikita Levy. A lawyer for another group taking action at USC, John Manly, said the case there also had echoes of Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving a life term in jail for sexually abusing more than 300 women and girls at the university and at USA Gymnastics. The group he is part of, Jane Does 5-10, alleges the university deliberately concealed Mr Tyndall's alleged abuses and failed to take action on complaints.

"Emmanuel Macron had meant to say that British people would not need visas in such circumstances. The confusion came as Mr Macron was speaking to the media in English at the end of an EU summit in Brussels. Instead of ""we will not stop visas"" he meant to say ""we will not start visas"", the Elysée Palace explained. UK citizens currently enjoy visa-free travel in the EU, but that could change with Brexit. The UK is set to leave the 28-nation bloc on 29 March 2019. The BBC's Gavin Lee raised the visa issue with President Macron at Thursday's news conference, after leaders had failed to achieve a breakthrough on Brexit. Lost in translation By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Brussels The mix-up came after I asked President Macron whether newspaper reports of UK citizens needing visas for work or holidays in the event of a no-deal was true. The president's response was that ""we will not stop visas, it is fake news, as some other leaders would say"", and he went on to say ""we will definitely deliver visas for people"". His team now say it was a case of a ""second language"" slip-up, and that President Macron meant to say ""we will not start visas for British people"". The press team for the Elysée Palace say the position of the French for their ""no-deal"" contingency planning is one that would categorically not mean visas for British people, UNLESS the UK suddenly imposed them on French workers and tourists in the UK. They say they would aim for a deal which allows for a ""special status"" agreement for workers and tourists for both countries, that avoids the need for any ""official visa system"". In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Macron said, measures would be taken to cover flights, ferries and businesses as well. A draft law has been tabled in the upper house of the French parliament that will let the government set new rules for Britons visiting France after Brexit. The draft suggests they will be treated as ""third country"" visitors - a similar category to Americans or Chinese. The preamble of the bill raises the possibility that visas may be imposed. But, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the bill also gives the government the power to adapt or suspend the need for visas and residence permits for UK citizens. 'Willingness to find solution' A deal remains elusive mainly because of wrangling over the future Northern Ireland border. Brexit risks reinstating physical controls at the border, which were scrapped under the Northern Ireland peace settlement. The current Brexit plan is for a transition period of 21 months from the end of March, to smooth the UK's path to a future relationship outside the EU. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that transition could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. But some Brexit campaigners have reacted angrily to the suggestion. ""I do prefer a deal and I want a deal, but I will never favour a bad deal,"" Mr Macron said on Thursday. ""In case of no deal our responsibility is to ensure that the life of our people will not be so far impacted."" Mr Macron described the ""dynamic"" of the Brexit negotiations as ""positive because there is a willingness on the British side to find a solution"". He said ""now it's for Prime Minister May to propose a solution, but we will not compromise on the key elements of the mandate we gave to [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier"". The French president also denied suggestions that the UK prime minister had been snubbed late on Wednesday, when four EU leaders went out for a drink in the Grand Place in the centre of Brussels. He told the BBC that Theresa May had left the summit earlier, and said she would certainly be invited in future. ""I am always happy and open to share a drink with the different leaders, so obviously Theresa May will be very much welcome,"" he said. Update 19 October 2018: Our story was amended after the Elysée Palace explained that Mr Macron had meant to say ""we will not start visas"" for British people, but had inadvertently used the verb ""stop"" instead.","France's president mixed up his English when he said in error that UK visitors would need French visas if there was a no-deal Brexit, aides say."
"By Roland HughesBBC News It was only appropriate that this was where Rosa had chosen to be married. After all, she had started her career inside a lion's cage, working as a serpentine dancer, in her mid-teens. This was the circus life into which she was born, in the back of a horse-drawn caravan in Belgium in December 1910. Her father was an animal trainer with the family outfit, Ménagerie Van Been, and they toured Europe alongside their snakes, bears and lions. ""I was born in a caravan, and that's where I left my heart,"" Rosa would later write in her autobiography. Aged 17, however, there was another contender for her heart: she fell for a man from another circus family, Joseph Bouglione, who she said reminded her of a cowboy, and the two were married among the lions. Their honeymoon was as unusual as their wedding - they spent it working with the troupe of the Wild West Show, established by hunter and showman Buffalo Bill Cody. Rosa's life after joining the Bouglione family brought her close to France's high society and made her a household name, even if attitudes towards the circus began to change in her later years. Rosa Bouglione died in Paris on Sunday, 26 August aged 107. Her funeral on Wednesday took place in the ring of the Cirque d'Hiver (Winter Circus), the 1,500-person venue in the Marais district which she and her husband's family took over in 1934. The grand circular building, commissioned by Napoleon III, remained the Bouglione family's base, even as they, their animals, clowns and performers travelled the world. It was a life that Joseph Bouglione said was like a constant holiday. In an interview in 2011, Rosa recalled one trip to Brazil, on which they were accompanied by 30 horses, 10 lions, six tigers and a polar bear, among other animals. When the captain of the ship carrying them tried to throw the circus' elephants overboard to reduce the ship's weight during a storm, Joseph threatened to organise a mutiny and so the crew tossed away much of the cargo instead. Running the circus was a feat of logistics: 100 trucks full of animals and equipment would have to be unloaded and then reloaded in a day, and 40 tonnes of cloth packed up tidily at the end of each show. And then there was the small matter of managing the animals themselves. There was Jacky the gorilla, who would drink only Perrier water and would make hammocks out of the curtains of any hotels where the troupe stayed. There was the anaconda which would squeeze the most attractive women a little tighter than the others. There was Coco, the foul-mouthed parrot who would fly to the balcony and scream ""Help!"" so loudly the police would come rushing round. More lives in profile Even as one of the biggest names in the circus world, the family was not always welcome on its travels, as Rosa told France's TF1 network in 2011. They were gypsies by origin, and were often treated with suspicion and subject to allegations as they arrived in a new town. ""I never understood it,"" she said. ""People said we'd steal children. But we never did. We had our own children, we didn't need to steal children. But we just let them say this stuff."" It was the Cirque d'Hiver that provided the platform for some of the family's biggest shows and most notable successes. Among them was La Perle du Bengale, where one performer braved the full force of a whip strike, and damsels in distress fell into pools swarming with snakes. Rosa stopped performing and did more work behind the scenes of the circus, and over time, the venue attracted the biggest names from the entertainment world and regularly hosted live TV specials. The actress, singer and black icon Josephine Baker was one, and soprano Maria Callas another. When Callas once got a little too close to Joseph Bouglione, she was almost crushed by an elephant that was wary of women other than Rosa being around him. Rosa and Joseph eventually brought an end to their life on the road, moving in to a house around the corner from the circus in 1984. Joseph died three years later but Rosa remained there until her death, surrounded by reminders of her career. Among them, the pelt of her pet leopard Mickey, that would sit on top of the dining table, his head still attached, seemingly snarling at any visitors. She would still attend matinees into her old age, and would let the performers know her opinion. ""The shows got bigger and the children got bigger, but I got smaller,"" she said. Read other recent obituaries Entertainment in 2018 is very different to that of the early 20th Century, when Rosa began dancing in the lion's cage. Nowadays, the Cirque d'Hiver is just as well known as a concert venue, or as the setting for political rallies. The industry is also under growing pressure to end the use of live animals - a debate that has arrived in France a little later than in other countries. Before his resignation this week, French environment minister Nicolas Hulot had said he was against the practice, and after the shooting to death of a tiger that had escaped from another Paris circus last November, campaigners renewed their calls for a ban on the use of live animals in shows. In 2016, the Bouglione family announced it would no longer use an ageing elephant in its shows after an environmental group accused the circus of mistreating the animal. But the family is divided about whether animals should still be a part of its performances. Last May, one of Rosa and Joseph's grandsons, André, who founded his own circus, said he would end the practice. ""It's because of my love of animals and out of respect for the public that I stopped this,"" he told the campaign group 30 Millions d'Amis in an interview. ""I saw a survey that said 80% of French people cared about animal rights. Our job is entertaining families. So if a very large majority of families believes this, we can't continue doing something that upsets them."" But another grandson, Francesco, who is now the director of the Cirque d'Hiver, has vowed to continue using animals and has condemned what he calls ""eco-terrorism"". He told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper last year: ""We're tired of being tainted by false claims, without mentioning the protests in front of our tents and acts of sabotage. This won't end well."" Rosa Bouglione leaves 55 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren, and a family name which remains above the entrance to the Cirque d'Hiver. In a statement, her family said she was ""the undisputed queen of the circus world"", adding: ""Her passion for the circus stayed with her until the very end."" A new show honouring Rosa's life, named Extra, will begin at the Cirque d'Hiver on 6 October.","When Rosa Bouglione was married inside a lion's cage, the pastor, despite his best efforts, was made to stay outside. It wouldn't have been much of a wedding had he been mauled."
"Gavin HewittEurope editor@BBCGavinHewitton Twitter One fact stood out above all others from a chaotic and confusing night: Greece, in the short term, would not be leaving the euro with all the chaos that would flow from it. Central bankers and European finance ministers, who had been on standby, could relax just a little. Like so much in the eurozone, a step is taken that buys time but little more. The winner was Antonis Samaras, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party. He defined the election as a choice between staying in the euro or returning to the drachma. Despite that stark choice only 40% of voters backed parties that supported the bailout deal with the EU and the IMF. The message from Greece was once more that they wanted to stay in the euro but not at the price of the austerity measures they were enduring. The outcome does not offer stability to Greece. Waiting in the wings will be a new powerful opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras. This leftist radical got 27% of the vote by promising to tear up the bailout agreement, even whilst insisting he wanted to stay in the euro. Shortly after the results Mr Samaras said he wanted to build a government of national unity. But Alexis Tsipras wanted nothing to do with it. His calculation is that this new coalition government will last just a few months. Last night he told his supporters: ""very soon the left will be in power"". And, for good measure, he repeated a message that found such resonance with the voters: ""overthrowing the bailout was the only solution"". He sounds like a politician not unhappy to be on the sidelines for a short period. More hard bargaining Mr Samaras's first priority will be to form a convincing coalition. He will get the support of Pasok, the Greek socialists. That coalition, in itself, brings with it problems. They are the two parties that have governed Greece for the past 30 years and are blamed for many of the country's problems. Once he has formed a government his immediate challenge is the bailout agreement. Although he accepted the basic terms of the deal he insisted during the campaign that he wanted concessions. It should be remembered that when Pasok was in power he opposed many of the austerity measures, saying that what Greece needed was growth. If he is confirmed in power he will have a stronger opposition breathing down his neck. He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult. Already the German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform (bailout) programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth. But the message is clear - the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay. The German finance minister underlined that message when he said ""Greece's path will be neither short nor easy"". And therein lies the instability. The Greek economy is in freefall. The country is in the fifth year of recession. Unemployment is at 22%. Real wages - for many people - are down by 25%. The streets bear the scars of social breakdown. The country does not have much time. What happens in Greece will be influenced by the outcome of the current tension between France and Germany. Hollande growth agenda The French President, Francois Hollande, will be emboldened by his victory in the French parliamentary elections. His Socialist party controls the Elysee Palace and parliament. The French view is that ""Europeans need to help Greeks return to growth"". Mr Hollande will push hard for his growth first agenda. He wants more flexibility on meeting deficit targets. He wants a European banking union that contains a joint deposit guarantee scheme. He is pushing a 120bn-euro (£97bn; $152bn) growth covenant for Europe. Chancellor Merkel is cautious as usual. In recent days there have been several warnings from Berlin that Germany cannot take on all of Europe's debts. And then it should not be forgotten - Greece had the ability to spark a severe crisis. But the future of the eurozone will be determined by what happens in Italy and Spain. And here two fundamental questions remain unanswered. If those economies get into difficulty what will stand behind them, how will they be supported? And - perhaps most importantly - where will growth come from to relieve two countries mired in recession? Without those answers the can is still just being kicked down the road.",You could almost hear the sighs of relief coming out of Brussels and Berlin when the results from the Greek election were finally established.
"In a report, the charity says that species at risk of global extinction have seen their Canadian populations fall by over 40% between 1970 and 2016. Populations of species that are at risk of extinction in Canada itself fell even more dramatically - by 59%. The report said human activity was mostly to blame. Wednesday's report is based on the Living Planet Index, which measures the ecological performance of 883 species around the world, including the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Barren Ground Caribou. The report found that endangered species were likely to face at least five threats, such as habitat loss, land and shoreline developments and pollution, and that human-activity was mostly to blame. Climate change and biodiversity loss accelerated the impacts of those threats the animals were already facing, the report said. ""Conservation actions that target only a single threat are unlikely to successfully stop and reverse wildlife declines as threats to species are often cumulative or synergistic and can have cascading effects,"" the report said. In the case of the Right Whale, climate change shifted the whale's migratory pattern to more commercial areas where they became vulnerable to ship strikes and more frequently became entangled in shipping gear. The report also pointed to recent research that found that indigenous-managed lands had more species than other parts of Canada, and better supported at-risk wildlife. The report suggested working with Canada's indigenous people to create more Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas. Canada is not alone in this crisis. A recent study found that humans have pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the brink of extinction.","Canadian wildlife at risk of extinction has undergone ""staggering"" losses over the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation group says."
"A local stamp will rise by 3p to 39p and for mail sent to the UK it will increase by 6p to 53p. Boley Smillie, chief executive, said the move had been forced on them by the challenges facing the business. Issues such as the increase in Royal Mail charges and the ongoing fall in the amount of mail sent had been factors, he said. Another element is the loss of LVCR (Low Value Consignment Relief) under which VAT was waived on goods valued at less than £15 when imported into the UK from outside the European Union. It will be scrapped in relation to goods sent from the Channel Islands from 1 April. He said: ""To put the price increase into perspective, the loss of LVCR will reduce our profit by £3.7m over the next twelve months. ""The tariff increases will reduce that impact by less than £500k, with the remainder offset by efficiencies achieved within the business."" Over the last two years Guernsey Post has seen a 15% drop in the amount of post sent. The company said the price increase would ensure it continued to meet its Universal Service Obligation, which sets out the minimum it has to provide for the island. The regulator, the Office of Utility Regulation, has approved the increase.","The cost of both local and UK stamps will rise from 1 May, Guernsey Post has announced."
"Pope Francis has said that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility, and that ""sanctions"" must be imposed against perpetrators. But the Church has been accused of failing to address some allegations properly. When did the scandals surface? The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the 1990s, revelations began of widespread abuse in Ireland. In the new century, more cases of abuse were revealed in more than a dozen countries. How damning are the allegations? Two major reports into Irish allegations of paedophilia in 2009 revealed the shocking extent of abuse, cover-ups and hierarchical failings involving thousands of victims, and stretching back decades. In one, four Dublin archbishops were found to have in effect turned a blind eye to cases of abuse from 1975 to 2004. A fresh scandal erupted in March 2010 when it emerged the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Cardinal Sean Brady, was present at meetings in 1975 where children signed vows of silence over complaints against a paedophile priest, Fr Brendan Smyth. This prompted Pope Benedict XVI to apologise to Irish victims. In the US, the Boston Archdiocese has been worst hit, with the activities of two of its priests, Paul Shanley and John Geoghan, causing public outrage. Cardinal Bernard Law resigned over the scandal in 2002. In Mexico, the founder of the Legion of Christ order, Marcial Maciel, long admired by Pope John Paul II, was disciplined by the Vatican in 2006 over the abuse of boys and young men over a period of 30 years. The Legion insisted his was an isolated case, but seven more priests of the order have been investigated. The bishop of the Belgian city of Bruges, Roger Vangheluwe, resigned in 2010 after admitting that he had sexually abused a boy for years. How has the Vatican responded? Since his election last year, Pope Francis has appeared to offer new hope to victims, with a call for action on sex abuse in the Church. Under his papacy, a Vatican committee has been set up to fight sexual abuse and help victims. In a report by Vatican Radio, the Pope asked for forgiveness for the ""evil"" damage to children caused by sexual abusers in the clergy and said ""sanctions"" would be imposed. Vatican officials submitted publicly to questioning for the first time in January 2013, before a UN panel in Geneva, but refused to supply data on abuse cases. Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, was accused of suppressing the investigation of paedophile priests, a charge he denied last year. When the first scandals emerged in 2001, the Vatican issued guidelines for senior clergy on how to handle paedophile priests, which stated that all cases should be referred to Rome. Until then, all cases had been handled by the Church in the country concerned. After a spate of new cases in 2010, the Vatican issued new rules saying bishops should report suspected cases of abuse to local police, if required to do so by law. What does the UN say? The UN's Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) said the Vatican should ""immediately remove"" all clergy who are known or suspected child abusers. In a strongly worded report, it lambasted the Holy See's ""practice of offenders' mobility"", referring to the transfer of child abusers from parish to parish within countries, and sometimes abroad. It complained that the Holy See had not acknowledged the extent of crimes committed and had not taken the measures necessary to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children. What do the victims say? Victims' groups have responded to almost every move by the Vatican with scepticism. Reacting to the UN report in February, Barbara Blaine, the president of Snap (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests), said it was clear that the Vatican had put the reputation of Church officials above protection of children. ""Despite all the rhetoric from Pope Francis and Vatican officials, they refuse to take action that will make this stop."" she said.","The UN has accused the Vatican of ""systematically"" adopting policies allowing priests to sexually abuse thousands of children."
"The trio, who ran a bar in Yangon, are accused over a flyer promoting a drinks event depicting Buddha with headphones. The image triggered an angry response online shortly after it appeared on the bar's Facebook page. Burmese law makes it illegal to insult or damage any religion. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has seen growing Buddhist nationalism in recent years. The flyer from VGastro Bar showed Buddha with his eyes shut, wearing large headphones, and surrounded by lurid colours. The flyer advertised a drinks afternoon with limitless alcohol and shisha pipes. Last week, police shut down the bar and detained general manager Philip Blackwood, 32, owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26. The arrest was triggered by a complaint by an official from the country's religious department. Buddhist nationalism The trial began on Thursday. It could take up to six months, and the three men could face up to two years in jail. All face two charges relating to insulting a religion and a third charge of causing public offence. The BBC's Jonah Fisher, in Myanmar, said the offences were considered so serious under Burmese law that there was no point in the trio applying for bail. The flyer was later removed and replaced with an apology, stating that the management's intention ""was never to cause offence to anyone or toward any religious group"". AP reported that four prosecution witnesses testified on Thursday, and defence witnesses are to testify on 26 December. Buddhist nationalism has been on the rise in Myanmar in recent years, with extremist monks such as Wirathu growing in popularity and increasing clashes with Muslim minorities, particularly in Rakhine state. On Wednesday a writer was detained on charges of offending religious feeling, local media said. Htin Lin Oo, a columnist now sacked from his position as an information officer with the opposition National League for Democracy, had given a speech that ""criticised the use of Buddhism as a tool for discrimination and extreme nationalism"", the Irrawaddy news magazine reported.",A New Zealander and two Burmese men have pleaded not guilty to charges of insulting Buddhism in Myanmar.
"Dougal Lane, president of the Guernsey Fisherman's Association, said safety ladders were urgently needed on the pontoons at the Fish Quay. ""Ten years I think we've been asking for [them],"" he said. ""They have them in the marina but we don't have them."" Harbourmaster Capt Peter Gill said the fishermen would need to find the money. Mr Lane said the facilities available to local fishermen were poor by comparison to other fishing communities. ""If you go round to any other working fishing port in Europe, the fishermen have a lot more facilities than we have here,"" he said. Mr Lane said low-water landing facilities, a crane and a fuel supply on the quay were all badly needed. Capt Gill said the consultation process on the island's ports masterplan would enable all views to be taken into account. In the meantime, he said, a crane could be installed on the Fish Quay but it would need to be paid for by the fishermen themselves. ""If that's what they want for their business, then they ought to be providing it,"" he said. ""There has to be a business case produced and if they want it, they can pay for it.""","Poor facilities at Guernsey's St Peter Port harbour are putting fishermen's safety at risk, according to their representative body."
"A 43-year-old Mississippi woman was thrown into the air recently after she turned her back on a bison to take a photo of herself with it. Four other tourists have been hurt in similar incidents this year, Yellowstone officials said. Previously bison attacks had been unusual, they added. ""The (woman) said they knew they were doing something wrong but thought it was OK because other people were nearby,"" park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett told the Associated Press. ""People are getting way too close."" The woman and her daughter got within about 18ft (5.5m) of the animal near the Fairy Falls trailhead just outside Old Faithful. The sprawling park is mostly located in north-west Wyoming. Someone warned them that they were too close, but the bison charged and the woman could not run away fast enough. Park rules say people should stay at least 75ft (23m) away from the bison. The massive beasts can weigh more than 2,000 pounds (900kg) and can move extremely quickly. The woman suffered only minor injuries, but in June a 68-year-old Georgia woman was seriously hurt after a bison gored her along a trail.",A series of injuries at Yellowstone National Park has officials warning tourists that selfies and bison don't mix.
"""To leaders all over the world: you are not going to gain by running away from social media,"" he said in Hindi during a question-and-answer session. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg moderated the hour-long event. Later on Sunday, Mr Modi was welcomed by more than 20,000 people at a stadium in nearby San Jose. The SAP Center event also drew protesters against Mr Modi's human rights records among other issues. Speaking at Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, Mr Modi said: ""The strength of social media today is that it can tell governments where they are wrong and can stop them from moving in the wrong direction."" ""We used to have elections every five years and now we can have them every five minutes,"" he added. Mr Modi, 65, regularly uses both Facebook and Twitter to communicate with millions of his followers. Candid moments Both Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Modi shared emotional moments during the discussion. After Mr Zuckerberg pointed out his parents in the audience, Mr Modi welled with tears speaking about his own. He recounted stories from his childhood in a poor family, selling tea at a railway station and doing hard chores to earn money. ""It is hard to imagine that a tea seller has actually become the leader of the world's biggest democracy,"" he said. The Facebook founder also told of a time when the company was going through what he called a ""rough patch"". His late mentor, Apple boss Steve Jobs, advised him to travel to India. ""Seeing the people and how people connected, reinforced what we were doing and is something I've always remembered,"" he said. At the scene: Dave Lee, North America Technology Reporter Outside the stadium, the enthusiasm for Mr Modi was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against his government. Those not on ""Team Modi"" are angry at what they see as ignorance towards Mr Modi's past. In particular, they say he did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi's plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, they say that's a front for mass surveillance. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its his tech-savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most. ""We're very proud,"" said one supporter outside the stadium. Highways and 'i-ways': How Modi wooed Silicon Valley Follow @DaveLeeBBC Connecting millions Mr Modi said he wanted to connect all India's villages to the internet - around a billion Indians currently lack internet access. Facebook says its internet.org project, which offers free access to a bundle of mobile phone web apps, can help get the developing world online. But it has drawn criticism in India, accused of favouring Facebook over local services. Mr Zuckerberg has promised to open the scheme to a wider range of apps. Mr Modi's tour of Silicon Valley included meetings with top officials from Apple, Google and other companies. US tech companies see India as a big commercial opportunity, but want the country to reduce red tape. Mr Modi wants to bring the success his compatriots have enjoyed in Silicon Valley - where around one in four tech companies is founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans - back to India.

"Two people have died and 11 are missing and presumed dead. Survivors told Mexican media that their home-made raft sank as it hit the reefs surrounding Isla Mujeres on Friday morning.

"A 23-year-old French citizen of Algerian origin, he had long been known to the French authorities as a petty criminal but latterly his links to Islamist extremism drew attention. The man who reportedly told police negotiators he was a member of al-Qaeda had recently made visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan, where he was found in the Taliban heartland of Kandahar. He reportedly admitted the shootings in which three unarmed French soldiers were killed, as well as a rabbi and three small children at a Jewish school. Merah reportedly held one little girl, Myriam Monsonego, by her hair to shoot her in the head. According to French prosecutors, he had expressed no regrets other than ""not having claimed more victims"" and was proud of having ""brought France to its knees"". He said he had been motivated by the fate of the Palestinians, the French military presence in Afghanistan and France's ban on the full veil, prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters. Juvenile delinquent Mohamed Merah was from Toulouse where he grew up on a housing estate in Les Izards, a troubled district in the north-east of the city with a large North African population. He later moved to the block of flats on Sergent Vigne Street, in the quieter, south-eastern district of Cote Pavee. From a family of five children, the suspect was largely raised by his mother, who was divorced. He was a mechanic by trade, according to French magazine Le Point, and loved scooters in particular. He was also a keen footballer. He was considered a juvenile delinquent. As a minor he was reported at least 15 times for acts of violence, and was described as having ""a violent profile from childhood and behavioural troubles"". First arrested in 2005, he served two short prison terms, in 2007 and 2009. His convictions reportedly include thefts and driving offences. In February, he was found guilty of driving without a licence and was due to appear in court in April. However, two of his friends said he was a ""nice guy"" who ""got on well with everyone"", JDD reports. One of them, Samir, said Merah had been seen in a Toulouse night club only last week. ""I served in the army and he never said anything to me about it,"" he added. ""I am also shocked he killed North Africans. We can't believe it."" Others give a different picture. 'Waster' An unnamed young man who ran into him in a rai (popular Arab music) night club around the time of the first shooting told the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur: ""He's a waster, a layabout. ""A loner. Not a serious guy... Sometimes he had his hair long, sometimes short, sometimes red."" An unnamed former paratrooper interviewed by local newspaper La Depeche was a friend of the first victim, Sgt Imad Ibn Ziaten, killed on 11 March. On Saturday night, 17 March, he ran into Merah, whom he also knew, and unwittingly embraced him, as is the custom. ""On Saturday, he even said to me, you are speaking to an angel,"" the ex-paratrooper said. ""I didn't understand at the time."" La Depeche suggests the ""angel"" may have been a reference to the suspect's jihadist beliefs. 'Al-Qaeda! al-Qaeda!' When he attacked paratroopers in Montauban on 15 March, Merah shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is great"" in Arabic, prosecutor Francois Molins said, quoting police who had viewed video of the attack. He reportedly became radicalised years ago while in prison, according to Le Point. French media reports say that two years ago he forced a boy to watch bloody videos from Afghanistan, then beat up the boy's sister after the boy's mother intervened. How French police tracked down the gunman Several witnesses in Les Izards are quoted by La Depeche as saying Merah turned up outside the family's home dressed in camouflage and waving a sword, shouting ""al-Qaeda! al-Qaeda!"" The mother lodged a complaint but there was apparently no prosecution, La Depeche adds. When Merah's mother was asked by police to assist in police negotiations, she reportedly refused, saying she no longer had any influence over her son. French lawyer Christian Etelin, who defended the suspect in non-terrorist proceedings in recent years, told AFP news agency he had not given the impression of being a fanatic and had never talked about Islam to him. ""But two years ago I learnt that he had suddenly become radicalised and had left for Afghanistan,"" the lawyer added. Merah visited Pakistan in 2011, from mid-August to mid-October. He had already visited the country in 2010, when he was stopped by Afghan police over the border in Kandahar, the former stronghold of the Taliban. Handed over to US forces, he was sent back to France, La Depeche writes. France's domestic intelligence agency (DCRI) was aware of his foreign trips and suspected him of radical Islamist activity. 'Such violence' Interior Minister Claude Gueant revealed that Merah had been asked by intelligence officials in November 2011 to explain his visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan and had shown them photographs to prove he had been a tourist. Mr Gueant defended the DCRI by saying it followed ""a lot of people engaged in radical Islamism"". ""Expressing ideas and manifesting Salafist opinions is not grounds enough for prosecution,"" he added. Days after the final shooting, Merah was tracked down by police to his flat where he opened fire when they tried to approach him. Said to be armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, an Uzi machine-gun and several handguns, he resisted arrest for nearly a day and a half. In his last conversation with police, on the evening of 21 March, he refused to surrender and threatened to kill police officers, Mr Gueant said in a detailed statement soon after news of his death. When RAID police commandos moved into the first-floor flat in the morning, he opened fire from the bathroom, shooting so heavily that an experienced commando later told the minister he had never seen an ""assault of such violence"". Merah jumped through a window with a gun in his hand, still firing, Interior Minister Gueant said. He continued shooting, at which point a RAID commando killed him with a single shot to the head, Francois Molins said. Three police officers were injured, one seriously, during the operation.","Mohamed Merah, the man believed to be the gunman on a scooter who killed seven people in south-western France, was killed in an armed siege after police surrounded his block of flats in Toulouse."

"Under the Anti-Fake News Bill, those convicted of disseminating false content would be jailed or fined up to RM500,000 ($128,000; £90,400), or both. The bill was tabled in parliament on Monday, ahead of a national election that is expected within weeks. Critics have called the bill an attempt by the authorities to stifle dissent. According to the bill, the term ""fake news"" is defined as ""news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false"". An offender would be anyone who ""by any means, knowingly creates, offers, publishes, prints, distributes, circulates or disseminates any fake news or publication containing fake news"". Blogs, public forums and social media accounts are also covered by the bill. It applies to anyone inside or outside Malaysia, as long as the ""fake news"" published concerns the country or those in it, which means foreigners can technically be sentenced in absentia. True or false? The move has been described as an attempt to silence opposition ahead of the general election. It must be held by August, but is widely expected within the next few weeks. ""The bill is 100% intended to muffle dissent... the punishment is extremely high and what amounts to fake news has been loosely defined,"" Eric Paulsen, co-founder of Malaysian human rights group Lawyers for Liberty, told the BBC. ""It also looks like they are rushing through the bill... before the elections. It's likely that it will be passed."" He added that the bill could affect reporting stories such as the scandal surrounding 1MDB, Malaysia's state development fund. It is alleged that hundreds of millions of dollars were ""misappropriated"" from the fund. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) had in 2015 reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's personal bank accounts. Mr Najib has denied taking any money from 1MDB. Just days ago, a Malaysian minister said any news relating to 1MDB that was not confirmed by the government was false. ""If this is [the government's] benchmark, then we will have a situation where only the government can determine if things are true or false,"" said Mr Paulsen.","Malaysia's government has proposed new legislation to combat ""fake news"", with offenders facing up to 10 years in prison."
"He has reached a plea agreement with US military authorities at Guantanamo. Khadr is accused of throwing a grenade that killed a US soldier during a raid on an al-Qaeda compound in Afghanistan. The 24-year-old, who had been facing a possible life sentence if convicted, was wounded and captured in Afghanistan in 2002 when he was 15. Khadr was charged at his war crimes tribunal with murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, providing material assistance to a terrorist organisation and espionage. The defendant also admitted planting improvised explosive devices and receiving weapons training from al-Qaeda. Details of the plea deal have not yet been disclosed. It could potentially mean Khadr avoids life in prison, or see him returned to Canada to serve a shorter jail term. Seven US military officers will gather on Tuesday to hear testimony about Khadr's actions and impose a sentence. Khadr's lawyers told the court that the US had agreed to support Khadr's request to return to Canada after one year to serve the rest of his sentence, adding that his return would ultimately be left in the hands of the Canadian government. 'Forced into war' During the tribunal, the Toronto native was dressed in a dark suit and stared at the table in front of him while holding his head with his hands. He repeatedly answered ""yes"" to questions from the judge, who asked Khadr if he understood the charges against him. The judge then asked him if anyone had made promises to him so that he would plead guilty, to which Khadr responded ""no"". Khadr was accused of killing US Army Sgt Christopher Speer, from New Mexico, when US troops raided a military compound in Afghanistan in 2002. Khadr's lawyers have argued in the past that his family forced him into the war as a child. They have also portrayed him as a boy intimidated by ""bad men"" directing his actions. Khadr's trial began in August but was delayed when his lawyer fell ill. He grew up in Canada, Pakistan and Afghanistan and is the son of an al-Qaeda official who was killed in 2003. Khadr is the second person to plead guilty at a military tribunal and the fifth inmate convicted since the US started the tribunals after the 9/11 attacks. The US is the first country since World War II to prosecute a person at a war crimes tribunal for actions allegedly committed as a juvenile. Critics of Guantanamo Bay have said Khadr should not be prosecuted because of his age at the time of the Afghanistan battle. US President Barack Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, but Congress has repeatedly blocked his efforts.","Canadian Omar Khadr, the youngest detainee at Guantanamo Bay, has pleaded guilty to all five terror charges against him at a war crimes tribunal."
"Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche was one of two men who were stabbed to death on a train on Friday in Portland, Oregon. Police named the other man who died as Ricky John Best, 53, a father of four and an Army veteran. Another passenger was wounded before the attacker was arrested. Police have identified the suspect as Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, a convicted felon. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday, charged with two counts of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon. However, Loren Cannon, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Oregon, said on Saturday it was too early to tell whether the ""violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime"". What happened? On Friday afternoon, two teenage girls, one of them Muslim and wearing a headscarf, boarded a train in Portland. According to witnesses, they attracted the attention of Mr Christian. Dyjuana Hudson - mother to one of the girls - said he began ""saying all Muslims should die"". Sergeant Pete Simpson confirmed the ""suspect was on the train and he was yelling and ranting and raving a lot of different things, including what would be characterised as hate speech or biased language"". Three men then stepped in to help the girls. Ms Hudson told the Oregonian that one of them said: ""You can't get at them like that — they're little girls."" But the suspect then allegedly turned on the girls' defenders. Sgt Simpson said: ""Some of the people that he was yelling at, they were attacked viciously by the suspect, resulting in the two deaths and one injury."" Apparently unaware of how badly injured their defenders were, the two terrified girls fled, calling Ms Hudson for help. Mr Christian was arrested shortly after he got off the train. Who were the victims? Mr Best was on his way home when he was attacked. He had spent 23 years serving in the US Army, retiring in 2012, according to the Oregon website Willamette Week. Since 2015, he had worked for the City of Portland. His colleague Kareen Perkins told Oregon Live he was ""the first person you would go to for help"". Mr Namkai-Meche was on the phone to his aunt when the suspect confronted the girls. Mr Namkai-Meche's aunt urged the economics graduate to get off the phone and film what was happening, KATU News reported. ""I didn't mean for him to try to be a hero and get himself killed but he was trying to protect those two teenage girls,"" she told the television station. Mr Namkai-Meche's mother paid tribute to her ""dear baby boy"" on Facebook. ""He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil,"" she wrote. ""Shining bright star I love you forever."" Ms Hudson, the mother of one of the girls, wrote on Facebook: ""Thank you thank you thank you... You will always be our hero."" The injured victim, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, remains in hospital. Portland mayor Ted Wheeler said the ""brave and selfless actions"" of the three men ""should serve as an example and inspiration to us all"". However, speaking at a press conference, he warned ""the current political climate allows far too much room for those who spread bigotry"". Who is the alleged attacker? A senior researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-attack monitoring group, said Mr Christian's Facebook page said he held ""some racist and other extremist beliefs"". His Facebook page also said he liked ""comix"" and ""cannabis"". An article in a Portland local alternative publication reported that he was a ""known white supremacist"" who had previously given a Nazi salute at a right-wing march. The police have declined to share details of his criminal history.","The mother of a US man who died protecting two young women from anti-Muslim harassment has called him ""a hero"" who ""will remain a hero"" after his death."
"The devices recovered at the crash site were the Boeing 737 Max 8's cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder. The plane was en route from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, when it crashed six minutes after take-off, killing all 157 people on board. Several airlines have grounded the Boeing model following the disaster. The months-old aircraft came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital at 08:44 local time (05:44 GMT). There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the flight, including Kenyans, Ethiopians, Canadians, and Britons. Do we know how it happened? The cause of the disaster is not yet clear. But the pilot had reported difficulties and asked to return to Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airlines said. ""At this stage, we can't rule out anything,"" CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said. ""We can't also attribute the cause to anything because we'll have to comply with the international regulation to wait for the investigation."" Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 reported that the plane's ""vertical speed was unstable after take-off"". The pilot was named as Senior Capt Yared Getachew who Ethiopian Airlines said had a ""commendable performance"" with more than 8,000 hours in the air. Several witnesses who worked in the farmland below the plane's flight path told the Reuters news agency they heard loud rattling noises coming from the aircraft and saw billows of smoke and debris in its wake as it made a low turn over the fields. ""When it was hovering, fire was following its tail, then it tried to lift its nose,"" said one witness, Gadisa Benti. ""When it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight to the ground with its nose, it then exploded."" What do we know about the plane? The 737 Max 8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017. The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion. It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"" on 4 February, the airline said. Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the crash and was sending a team to provide technical assistance. It was the second crash in five months involving a 737 Max 8, and comparisons are being drawn with a Lion Air accident in Indonesia last October that killed 189 people. Following the Lion Air crash, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggested. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. ""It's highly suspicious,"" Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of the US Transportation Department, told CNN. ""Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year. That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn't happen."" After last October's crash, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system. Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with the issue, Reuters reports. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. Who were the victims? There were 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports) on the flight. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia. At least 21 passengers were affiliated with the UN and were travelling to a session of its Environment Assembly in Nairobi. ""It is one of the biggest catastrophes we have had in years,"" Michael Moller, director-general of the UN Office in Geneva, told the session on Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences for the dead. ""Our colleagues were women and men, junior professionals and seasoned officials, hailing from all corners of the globe and with a wide array of expertise,"" he said. ""They all had one thing in common: a spirit to serve the people of the world and to make it a better place for us all."" David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Programme, said seven members of the agency's staff had died in the crash, including Irish and Italian nationals. What happens next? The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities in co-ordination with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded all of its 737 Max 8s ""until further notice"" as ""an extra safety precaution"". The airline's first flight to Kenya since the crash touched down at 10:25 local time on Monday, and a different model of plane was used. Meanwhile: Shares in Boeing fell by 12.9% in the wake of the crash.",Investigators have found the flight data recorders from an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on Sunday.
"Rifles, machine guns, grenades, anti-tank systems and armoured vehicles would be sent, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said. Correspondents says it is rare for Germany to export weapons into an active conflict zone. The US, Italy, France and Britain are also arming Kurds in northern Iraq. ""This is in our security interest,"" Ms von der Leyen said, adding that the shipments would be made in three tranches starting this month. The weapons will be flown to Irbil in Kurdish-run northern Iraq, via Baghdad. The equipment has been in German depots for a long time, much of it dating back to the Cold War, German ARD TV reports. Defence against IS Some German politicians have voiced concern that the weapons could end up in the wrong hands. ""This isn't an easy decision for us, but it's the right decision in a situation that is difficult in every way,"" said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The government said Germany had a ""humanitarian responsibility... to help those suffering and to stop IS [Islamic State militants]"". Germany has already sent humanitarian aid to the Kurdish region to help refugees displaced by IS, which is persecuting Shia Muslims, Christians, Yazidis and other minorities. The arms will come from German army depots, and will include 30 Milan anti-tank rocket launchers with 500 rockets, ARD TV reports. Milan launchers have already been used by combatants in Syria, and IS fighters are believed to have them. The Milan can hit targets at a distance of 2,000m (6,500ft). Germany will also send 240 armour-piercing bazookas, 8,000 G3 rifles with two million rounds, and 8,000 of the newer G36 rifles, with four million rounds. Forty MG3 machine guns are also on the list, and 8,000 pistols. More than 100 military vehicles will also be sent - mostly troop transporters.","Germany has decided to send weapons to equip 4,000 Kurdish fighters defending areas of northern Iraq against Islamist militants."
"By Eva OntiverosBBC World Service Although primarily concentrated in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East, it is also practised in some countries in Asia and Latin America. And amongst immigrant populations living in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, the UN says. It is calling for an end to FGM on International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation on 6 February. FGM can cause physical and mental health problems that go on to affect women in later life, as Bishara Sheikh Hamo, from the Borana Community in Kenya's Isiolo County explains. ""I underwent FGM when I was 11 years old,"" says Bishara. ""I was told by my grandmother FGM is a requirement for every girl, that it made us pure."" But what Bishara did not know was that it would leave her with irregular periods, bladder problems, and recurrent infections. She was only able to give birth via Caesarean section. She is now an anti FGM campaigner. What is Female Genital Mutilation? Female genital mutilation, or FGM for short, is the deliberate cutting or removal of a female's external genitalia. It often involves the removal or cutting of the labia and clitoris, and the World Health Organization describes it as ""any procedure that injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"". Omnia Ibrahim, a blogger and film maker from Egypt, says FGM is distressing and damages women's relationships and how they feel about themselves. ""You are an ice cube. You don't feel; you don't love; you don't have desire,"" she says. Omnia says she has struggled with the psychological impact of FGM all her adult life. She says her community taught her ""that a body means sex and that sex is a sin. To my mind my body had become a curse"". ""I used to always ask myself: did I hate sex because I was taught to be afraid of it, or do I really not care for it?"" In Kenya, Bishara told the BBC FGM was carried out on her, together with four other girls. ""I was blindfolded. Then she [the cutter] tied my hands behind my back. My legs were spread open and then they pinned down my labia."" ""Then after a few minutes, I felt a sharp pain. I screamed, I yelled, but no-one could hear me. I tried to kick myself free, but a vice-like grip held my leg. She says it was ""pathetic. It's one of the most severe types of medical procedures, and so unhygienic. They used the same cutting tool on all of us girls"". The only pain relief available was a traditional remedy: ""There was a hole in the ground, and they kept herbs in the hole. Then they tied my legs like a goat and rubbed the herbs on me. Then they said 'next girl, next girl,' and they took another girl..."" Although FGM it is illegal in many countries, it is still routinely carried out in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East - and also among the diaspora of those countries where FGM is common. There are four types of FGM Type 1: Clitoridectomy. That's the total or partial removal of the sensitive clitoris and its surrounding skin. Type 2: Excision. The partial or total removal of the clitoris plus the removal of the labia minora, or inner skin folds surrounding the vagina. Type 3: Infibulation. The cutting and repositioning of the labia minora and the labia majora - the outer skin folds that surround the vagina. This often includes stitching to leave only a small gap. This practice is not only extremely painful and distressing, it's also an ongoing infection risk: the closing over of the vagina and the urethra leaves women with a very small opening through which to pass menstrual fluid and urine. In fact, sometimes the opening can be so small that it needs to be cut open to allow sexual intercourse or birth - often causing complications which harm both mother and baby. Type 4: This covers all other harmful procedures like pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterising the clitoris or genital area. Why does it happen? The most frequently cited reasons for carrying out FGM are social acceptance, religion, misconceptions about hygiene, a means of preserving a girl or woman's virginity, making the woman ""marriageable"" and enhancing male sexual pleasure. In some cultures FGM is regarded as a rite of passage into adulthood, and considered a pre-requisite for marriage. Although there are no hygienic advantages or health benefits to FGM, practising communities believe that women's vaginas need to be cut - and women who have not undergone FGM are regarded as unhealthy, unclean or unworthy. Often it's performed against their will, and health professionals worldwide consider it a form of violence against women and a violation of their human rights. When FGM is inflicted on children, it is also seen as a form of child abuse. Where is FGM practised? Many of the women surveyed by Unicef and the WHO said it was taboo to even discuss FGM in their communities for fear of attracting criticism from outsiders, or - in those places where FGM is illegal - for fear it would lead to prosecution of family or community members. Therefore figures are based on estimates. The above map was put together by The Woman Stats Project, who have collated research on the issue, including data from the UN and Unicef. It is estimated by the UN that although FGM is concentrated in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East, it is also practiced in some countries in Asia and Latin America. And amongst immigrant populations living in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, the UN says. According to a Unicef report carried out in 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, the practice is still being widely carried out, despite the fact that 24 of these countries have legislation or some form of decrees against FGM. In countries such as the UK, where FGM is illegal, expert and barrister Dr Charlotte Proudman says it is increasingly being performed on babies and infants. Therefore it is ""almost impossible to detect"" as the girls are not in school or old enough to report it. Recently a mother in London became the first person in the UK to be found guilty of carrying out FGM on her three-year-old daughter. She will be sentenced on 8 March.","It's estimated that 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of FGM, according to the United Nations (UN)."
"The 200-year-old building in Rio de Janeiro burned down in September, destroying almost all of its artefacts. But on Friday the museum's director announced that 80% of Luzia's skull fragments had been identified. The human remains - the oldest ever found in Latin America - were viewed as the jewel of the museum's collection. The museum staff said they were confident they could recover the rest of Luzia's skull and attempt reassembly. ""They've suffered alterations, damage but we're very optimistic at the find and all it represents,"" archaeologist Claudia Rodrigues was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. The skull is understood to have been stored in a metal box inside a cabinet, described as a ""strategic place"", which helped it resist fire damage. Structural work to secure the historical palace in the Brazilian city is still being carried out almost 50 days on from the fire. The cause of the blaze - which tore through hundreds of rooms containing more than 20 million artefacts - is still under investigation. The 2 September fire sparked criticism and protests of the country's government in its aftermath. The museum is managed by Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, whose rector said they had known the building was vulnerable because of financial cuts. Luzia's remains were found in a cave in the 1970s in the state of Minas Gerais, north of Rio, by French archaeologist Annette Laming-Emperaire. Tests suggest the skull and bones belonged to a woman in her 20s who was just under 1.5m (5ft tall) - and they were believed to be the oldest recovered on the continent. Experts had produced a digital image of her face using her skull, which was used as the basis for a sculpture that was also in display on the building. Luzia was named in homage to Lucy - the famous and important 3.2 million-year-old human remains found in Africa in 1974.","Most of the skull from a prized 12,000-year-old fossil nicknamed Luzia has been recovered from the wreckage of a fire in Brazil's National Museum."
"By Michael BristowBBC News, Beijing They are there to apply for visas to visit America - to work, to study and to travel. The desire to go to the United States is just one of any number of symbols that reveals the country's enduring appeal to foreigners. China's leaders want their own country to be seen in a similar light - and have spent billions of dollars to project the right image. But a number of recent incidents - the flight of a blind activist to the States being just one - seem to have undermined those efforts. Some think a country that locks up people for speaking their mind will always struggle to generate the right kind of image abroad. ""I don't think we know how to speak and create soft power for the international community,"" said Hung Huang, the editor of lifestyle magazine iLook. She said the country's leaders often adopted a patronising or a bullying attitude, neither of which endears them to foreigners. 'Always happy' Any Chinese leader who wants to know how to build up the country's soft power could do worse than visit the US embassy. Chinese people applying for US visas are happy to talk about America's appeal. University graduate Liu Lirong was there to apply to go to the States for eight months to work as a cook on a yacht. ""I've loved watching American programmes since I was in middle school. People there are very open and know how to let the pressure go - and are always happy,"" she said. Another visa applicant, Peng Cheng, 17, said: ""The US is the biggest developed country. I want to know its culture, its traditions and its universities - and see how it's different from our own."" Last year the US government processed one million visas in China and this year it expects to approve many more. Chinese leaders have spent huge amounts of cash trying to generate a similar kind of enthusiasm for their own country. One symbol of that effort is an unusual-looking skyscraper that stands in Beijing's central business district. It has been dubbed ""big pants"" by local people because it looks like a pair of trousers. The building will soon be China Central Television's (CCTV) new headquarters. Confucius Institutes Chinese media reports say that the central government is spending more than $7bn (£4.5bn) to expand state-run media organisations like CCTV. Much of that money will go into output that is directly aimed at foreigners; CCTV now has programming in English, French, Russian, Spanish and Arabic. China has also set up Confucius Institutes across the world. These are centres that teach Chinese language and promote Chinese culture. There are more than 80 in the US alone. A global BBC poll that looked at attitudes towards other countries found China's image had improved in both the developed and developing world. But a number of recent events suggests the country often has a brittle relationship with foreigners. One of those involves an increasingly shrill argument with the Philippines about who has sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal, a group of rocks in the South China Sea called the Huangyan Islands by China. This disagreement suggests China seems to have trouble convincing the world that its rise is entirely peaceful. There have been other events that have pitched China against a seemingly hostile outside world, including China's decision to expel the al-Jazeera correspondent Melissa Chan. Yang Rui, the host of CCTV's English-language talkshow Dialogue, encapsulated one extreme attitude towards foreigners on his micro-blog site. He called for the public security bureau to ""clean out the foreign trash"". Another bad news day came when the blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng escaped home detention for the safety of the US embassy in Beijing. He emerged from the embassy after six days, and has now left China to go and study law in New York. Some Chinese leaders must have felt uncomfortable that one of their own citizens feels safer in the US than in his own country. Hung Huang, the magazine editor, said to solve this problem China would have to change the way the country is governed, so people do not feel the need to flee. ""If we had a judicial system that's just - or tries to be just, then we wouldn't have a Chen Guangcheng,"" she said. Harvard professor Joseph Nye, the man who coined the term ""soft power"" - the ability to get what you want through persuasion and attraction - says that China is still struggling to make that a reality. He agrees that China needs to change at home to promote its image abroad. ""What China seems not to appreciate is that using culture and narrative to create soft power is not easy when they are inconsistent with domestic realities,"" he wrote this year in the New York Times.","At the US embassy in Beijing on any given weekday, hundreds of Chinese people mill around clutching sheaves of papers and wearing excited smiles."
"Footage shared on social media showed people being crushed at the bottom as stairs on the escalator crumpled. Many of those injured were fans of the visiting Russian football team CSKA Moscow. One of the fans had a foot partially severed in the crush. At least two others needed surgery for injuries to their legs. The accident happened before CSKA Moscow's match with Roma in the group stages of the Champions League. Witnesses quoted by police said the Russian fans had been singing and jumping before the escalator gave way. ""A group of CSKA fans were going down into the station. At that moment the escalator collapsed,"" a police spokesman told Russian news agency RIA. Most of the injured were CSKA fans, the spokesman added. Video posted by a Russian fan showed the escalator moving down at very high speed, with people trying to cling to the handrails. There was panic as people ploughed into each other at the bottom and one person was hauled to safety by a man on a parallel escalator. ""I just experienced a scene from the apocalypse,"" one witness told Repubblica newspaper. ""One of the steps on the downward escalator, just a metre away from me, started accelerating extremely fast like it had gone crazy."" Pictures of the damaged escalator show a tangle of broken and twisted metal. The fire brigade tweeted a video of its operation at 21:00 (19:00 GMT) to say all the wounded had been rescued and taken to hospital. Three people suffered serious injuries, according to local reports. Surgeons operated on a man in his thirties in the hope of saving his foot. Rome officials have opened an investigation into what happened. The city's transport infrastructure is notoriously chaotic but local transport authority Atac said maintenance checks on the station's escalators were carried out on a monthly basis. City Mayor Virginia Raggi visited the scene of the accident to express her sympathy for the injured.","More than 20 people were hurt, some seriously, when an escalator ran out of control at a Rome metro station."
"Its foreign ministry ordered reporters from the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal to return media passes within 10 days. The papers criticised the move, which will affect at least 13 reporters. The Times said it was a mistake for China to cut itself off, while the WSJ called it an attack on press freedom. ""We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel US reporters,"" said Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron. He said the decision was particularly regrettable because it came during the global crisis over the coronavirus. At a press briefing in Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called the move a legitimate response to the restrictions placed on Chinese journalists in the US. China's action is part of a swiftly escalating row between Beijing and Washington, and correspondents say the departure of the reporters will have a major impact on what the world knows about China as they do some of the most in-depth reporting about the country. The measures were in response to ""unwarranted restrictions on Chinese media agencies"" in the US, the foreign ministry said. It also demanded information about the papers' operations in China. China's action also prohibits the newspapers' journalists from working in the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau, where there is greater press freedom than on the mainland. Earlier this month, the Trump administration imposed limits on the number of Chinese citizens who could work as journalists in the US – the latest move in a tit-for-tat row over press freedoms. “What the US has done is exclusively targeting Chinese media organisations, and hence driven by a Cold War mentality and ideological bias,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Beijing to reconsider its decision, calling the move “unfortunate”. “I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct the free press operations that, frankly, would be really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times where more information, more transparency, are what will save lives,” Mr Pompeo said. Great loss for Chinese journalism Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese All foreign correspondents in China are required to renew their press credentials annually, which usually happens at the year end. This means most American reporters of the three US major publications have an expiring visa and will need to leave China under the new rules. We don't know the exact number of affected journalists yet, but it's believed to be close to a dozen. The expulsions will lead to a major personnel loss in these three media organisations' China operation, especially for the Wall Street Journal, which had already seen three reporters expelled from China last month. Critics say it's an even greater loss for China, as the draconian measures come at a time when the country and the rest of the world need high-quality journalism on China more than ever. It's still unclear whether the US publications can send new correspondents, American citizens or not, to fill in the positions in China. In the midst of a dangerous pandemic, the world's two superpowers are locked in an escalating war with multiple fronts. By fighting over media, the origin of the coronavirus, and technology and trade, the US and China are competing to prove the superiority of their own political model. At the beginning of March, the US state department said five media outlets, including China's official news agency Xinhua, would be required to reduce their total number of staff to 100 from 160. The move was seen as retaliation for China's expulsion of two US journalists for the Wall Street Journal over a coronavirus editorial in February. The row over media access is the latest episode in an increasingly acrimonious dispute between China and the US. Disagreements over trade, intellectual property rights and 5G networks have damaged relations in recent years. The coronavirus pandemic has been a source of tension too, with Washington and Beijing both accusing each other of spreading misinformation. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the coronavirus as “Chinese”. A foreign ministry spokesman accused the US of stigmatising China, where the first cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the city of Wuhan in late 2019. However, last week a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman shared an unfounded conspiracy theory, alleging the US Army had brought the virus to the region. The unfounded accusation led Mr Pompeo to demand China stop spreading “disinformation” as it tried “to shift blame” for the outbreak.",China has effectively expelled journalists from three US newspapers in retaliation for restrictions on its news outlets in the US.
"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter US officials have described the joint Russian-Syrian onslaught against Aleppo as ""barbarism"" and warned that war crimes are being carried out. The Russian president has spoken explicitly about the worsening climate between Washington and Moscow, insisting that what the Obama administration wants is ""diktat"" rather than dialogue. For all that, the US and Russia are still in contact over Syria. For all the harsh rhetoric and accusations, they both realise that they have a vital role to play in any eventual settlement of the Syrian drama. Whatever its immediate strategic intentions, a permanent war in Syria doesn't benefit Moscow any more than Washington. But without that basic level of trust and understanding between them, any dialogue rests upon shaky foundations. It was never supposed to be like this. The end of the Cold War was supposed to usher in a new era. For a time Russia retreated from the world stage, but now it is back with a vengeance, eager to consolidate its position nearer home; to restore something of its former global role and to make up for perceived slights perpetrated by the West. So where did it all go wrong? Why were Russia and the West unable to forge a different type of relationship? Who is to blame? Was it US over-reach and insensitivity, or Russia's nostalgia for Soviet greatness? Why have things now got so bad and is it correct to describe the present state of affairs as a ""new Cold War""? I am not going to try to give a comprehensive answer to all these questions - the intricacies of this story would require a book the length of Tolstoy's War and Peace! But I am going to try to throw out some pointers. For Paul R Pillar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Security Studies at Georgetown University and a former senior CIA officer, the initial fault lies with the West. ""The relationship went wrong when the West did not treat Russia as a nation that had shaken off Soviet Communism,"" he told me. ""It should have been welcomed as such into a new community of nations - but instead it was regarded as the successor state of the USSR, inheriting its status as the principal focus of Western distrust."" This original sin, if you like, was compounded by the West's enthusiasm for Nato expansion, first taking in countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, who had long nationalist traditions of struggling against rule from Moscow. But Nato's expansion didn't end there as it added countries like the three Baltic States, whose territory had been part of the former Soviet Union. Is it any wonder then, the critics ask, that Moscow should baulk also at the idea of Georgia or Ukraine entering the western orbit? In short, Russia believes that it has been treated unfairly since the end of the Cold War. This, of course, is not the conventional view in the West, which prefers to focus on Russian ""revanchism"" - a stance personified by Vladimir Putin, a man who has described the collapse of the Soviet Union as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century. There is an interesting debate going on among US think tank experts as to which camp is right. Should one focus on the initial strategic errors of the West in dealing with the new Russia, or look at Moscow's more recent assertive behaviour in Georgia, Syria or Ukraine? Sir John Sawers, the former head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), is also a former UK ambassador to the United Nations and has watched Russian diplomacy unfold over recent years. He prefers to focus on the more recent period. In a recent BBC interview he said that the West had not paid sufficient attention to building the right strategic relationship with Russia over the last eight years. ""If there was a clear understanding between Washington and Moscow about the rules of the road - that we are not trying to bring down each other's systems - then solving regional problems like Syria or Ukraine or North Korea - which is coming rapidly down the path towards us - would be easier,"" he said. Several experts I spoke to also pointed to the flat-footedness of the Obama administration's diplomacy and the mixed signals it has often sent. Washington's absolute power may be declining, but it has sometimes appeared equivocal about using the variety of levers of power that remain. Is it pivoting towards Asia and to what extent is it really downplaying its role in Europe and the Middle East? Is it prepared to back up its rhetoric with force? (In Syria the answer has been no.) And has it really thought through the implications of the positions that it has taken towards Moscow? In 2014, in the wake of Russia's annexation of the Crimea, Mr Putin spoke to the Russian Duma, noting that ""if you compress the spring all the way to its limit it will snap back hard. You must remember this"", he stressed. As Nikolas K Gvosdev noted recently on the website of the National Interest - a US policy magazine dedicated to the pragmatic ""realist"" view of foreign policy - ""The prudent response would either be to find ways to de-escalate the pressure on the spring or to prepare for its snapback and to be able to cushion the shock"". Whatever the errors of the past and whoever may be responsible we are, as they say, where we are. And where is that? Are the US and Russia really on the brink of conflict over Syria? I don't think so, but what about the idea of us all entering a ""new Cold War""? Paul Pillar, for one, thinks this is not the right term. ""There is not the sort of global ideological competition that characterised the Cold War and fortunately we do not have another nuclear arms race,"" he told me. ""What is left is great competition for influence and Russia is a power of a lesser order than the Soviet Union was and than the superpower United States still is."" So what of the future? With the US presidential contest looming, Moscow may clearly believe it has a free hand for the time being. And there is evidence that it intends to use it to shape a variety of conflict zones in a manner that presents the next resident of the White House with a fait accompli. The situation is reminiscent of 2008 when US-Russia relations went into the freezer in the wake of the Russia-Georgia war. This left the Bush administration's policy towards Moscow in a shambles and it is this mess that President Obama inherited. Remember the famous ""reset"" of relations with Russia by a secretary of state called Hillary Clinton? Well, that didn't come to much. Sir John told the BBC that, in his view, ""there is a big responsibility on the next US president (and I very much hope it will be Hillary Clinton - he notes) to establish a different sort of relationship. We are not looking for a warmer relationship with Russia and we are not looking for a frostier relationship with Russia"", he asserts. ""What we are looking for is a strategic understanding with Moscow about how we provide for global stability, for stability across Europe between Russia and the US, so that the fundamental stability of the world is put on a firmer basis than it has been."" Pax Americana - the American unipolar moment - he notes, ""was very short-lived and it is now over"".",It is hard to imagine a period since the end of the Cold War when relations between Russia and the United States have been quite so bad.
"By Katy WatsonBBC Mexico and Central America reporter Whether it was the shout repeatedly asking the president to: ""Resign, now,"" or the honking of the vuvuzelas in the crowds, their cries seem to have been heard. Earlier this month, President Otto Perez Molina stood down, after Congress voted to strip him of his immunity. He is now behind bars, awaiting trial over an alleged corruption scandal that has outraged Guatemalans. Mr Perez Molina has been accused of involvement in a case known as ""La Linea"" (The Line), named after a hotline businesses allegedly called to access corrupt officials. Prosecutors say millions of dollars were paid in bribes. The allegations emerged in April in an investigation by the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a UN body created in 2006 to strengthen the country's rule of law. Former Vice-President Eduardo Stein, who helped establish the commission, says Guatemala wanted to learn how to carry through criminal investigations that had previously been weak and often knocked down at the beginning of the trial. ""Since the UN has a way of handling post-war societies, through the Security Council, we thought, 'Why can't we ask for a different kind of help from the international community that could strengthen our judiciary?'"" he says. The commission's role has evolved to include alleged corruption cases. New hero There was no precedent for the CICIG, according to Adriana Beltran from the Washington Office on Latin America. It was not easy to set up either. But it has proven successful. Unable to look up to their leadership, Guatemalans' modern-day hero is Ivan Velasquez, who is in charge of the CICIG. He is a superstar in Guatemala at the moment, and now many in the region want a CICIG of their own. ""It's something each country has to evaluate,"" Mr Velasquez tells BBC Mundo. He acknowledges there is a desire for a CICIG in places such as Honduras, which has seen its own protests over alleged corruption in recent months. There are also calls from Mexico. ""But it has to be with cooperation from the government, because this isn't just a commission brought in by anyone,"" Mr Velasquez adds. ""There has to be a will from the country to establish a commission like this."" International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala objectives: Former Mexican Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda agrees the next logical candidate for a UN-type body is Honduras. It is far less likely to happen in Mexico, although he says there is a growing acceptance by the Mexican authorities of outside help. The best example of that is with the investigation into the 43 students who disappeared last year. With families unsatisfied with the government's efforts, six months ago, a group of independent foreign experts were hired by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to look in to the investigation. On Sunday, they released a damning report, challenging the government's version of what had happened on the night the students disappeared. There are similar cases where there is pressure for external reviews, such as with an alleged shootout by federal police in Tanhuato, torture in the town of Tlatlaya and an alleged massacre in Apatzingan. ""It's not impossible that a little later you'll move on to corruption,"" says Mr Castaneda. Impunity in Mexico Last year, Mexico ranked 103 out of 175 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions list. According to Mexico's statistics institute, 98% of homicides in 2012 went unsolved. This issue of impunity is right at the heart of what people are dissatisfied with in Mexico, according to Duncan Wood, of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Centre in Washington. ""The fact that a country like Guatemala has been able to take this step forward just highlights how backwards things are in Mexico,"" he says. Mr Wood says there has been progress, with a recently-passed anti-corruption law, and acknowledges Mexico has an advanced legal framework. ""But when it comes down to implementation and execution, it doesn't do a particularly good job historically,"" he says. Many of the recent political controversies in Mexico have been issues of conflict of interest, such as the so-called ""White House scandal"", which raised questions about how the president and First Lady Angelica Rivera acquired their $7m (£4m) private home. And Mr Wood thinks the country has not yet reached its tipping point. ""Mexican society has a unique alchemy,"" he says. ""The same conditions that would force a change in Guatemala are not going to force the same change in Mexico.""",Guatemalans have been making quite a noise in recent months.
"""A lot of progress"" was being made, he said, speaking alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in in New York. ""The relationship is very good and in some ways... extraordinary,"" he added. Just a year ago, the US and North Korea were publicly speaking of a nuclear confrontation but Mr Trump had historic first talks with Mr Kim in June. Speaking earlier, at UN headquarters in New York, he said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would arrange the next summit ""in the immediate future"". No decision had yet been taken as to the venue, he said. Mr Moon recently completed a high-profile, three-day visit to Pyongyang - the first by a Southern leader to the North's capital in a decade. He said on Monday that he had been ""able to confirm Chairman Kim's firm commitment to complete denuclearisation"" and that he had also expressed his wish to meet Mr Trump again soon. The Singapore summit was the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. The pair signed a document pledging to establish new relations, work towards ""complete denuclearisation"" and to build a lasting peace on the peninsula. However the details of the agreement were vague, with no timeline nor indication of how denuclearisation would be achieved and verified. Since then, the North has made overtures to the South and tried to improve its image. While little concrete change has occurred, North Korea has suspended its controversial missile testing, a major source of regional tension. Mr Kim has promised to dismantle North Korea's main missile testing and launching site, and said he could decommission the main nuclear test site, if the US took some reciprocal action. Some critics have raised concerns that the human rights situation in North Korea has been ignored to ensure better relations. Mr Trump and Mr Moon also signed a revised trade pact, aimed at expanding opportunities for US carmakers and pharmaceutical companies. It marks the first such agreement finalised by the US president, who has promised to overhaul his country's trade relationships.","US President Donald Trump has said he expects to have a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the ""not too distant future""."
"The Liberals and Christian Democrats have had to make concessions to anti-Islamist Geert Wilders to gain his support for their minority coalition. The deal ends months of deadlock but still needs to be ratified by Christian Democrats in a meeting on Saturday. The pact includes plans for budget cuts of 18bn euros ($24bn; £15bn) by 2015. It also tightens rules on immigration and boosts the number of police officers. ""Important reforms will be carried out in the Netherlands,"" Liberal party leader Mark Rutte said in presenting the pact, titled Freedom and Responsibility. ""We want to give the country back to the working Dutch citizen."" The Liberal party (VVD) and the Christian Democrats (CDA) have 52 seats between them in the 150-seat parliament and propose to form a minority government. They would rely on the Freedom Party's 24 seats to pass legislation by a tiny margin. Under the deal, VVD leader Mr Rutte would become prime minister, forming a cabinet with the CDA, led by Maxime Verhagen. Mr Verhagen described the deal as a ""very good governing agreement"". ""I am convinced that it is an agreement that every Christian Democrat will be able to identify with,"" he said. Marathon talks The deal has angered some CDA MPs who do not want to work with Mr Wilders. CDA MPs decided after marathon talks on Wednesday to leave the final decision on joining the coalition to a special conference on Saturday. Mr Wilders is well known for his controversial far-right views. He has campaigned to stop the ""Islamisation of the Netherlands"" and is due to stand trial next week on hate speech charges for allegedly insulting Islam. The Netherlands has been run by a caretaker government since February when a coalition led by the CDA's former leader, Jan Peter Balkenende, collapsed after a row over military involvement in Afghanistan. June's general election delivered a surge of support for the Freedom Party, which won the third biggest share of the seats.","A ban on wearing the full Islamic veil in the Netherlands will be part of the government's programme under a pact to form a coalition, party leaders say."
"By Alix KroegerBBC News What are the concerns about Xinjiang cotton? Rights groups say Xinjiang's Uighur minority (also spelled as ""Uyghur"") are being persecuted and conscripted for forced labour. Evidence shown to the BBC suggests that upwards of half a million Uighur minority workers a year are being marshalled into seasonal cotton picking under conditions that appear to raise a high risk of coercion. ""Right now, there is near certainty that any brand sourcing apparel, textiles, yarn or cotton from the Uyghur Region is profiting from human rights violations, including forced labour, both in the Uyghur Region and more broadly throughout China,"" says the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uyghur Region, whose members include Anti-Slavery International and the World Uyghur Congress. Who uses it? It can be difficult to pin down, since much of it gets absorbed into global supply chains. But if you bear in mind that Xinjiang cotton accounts for 85% of Chinese production and 20% of world supply, the chances are high that you've got some in your wardrobe. There are two ways of looking at it: top down, and bottom up. Retailers typically only know the first tier in their supply chain. For example, a retailer commissions a shirt from a supplier, who buys the fabric from a mill, which buys the yarn from a spinning mill, which bought the cotton from a broker, who bought cotton from any number of farms. Tracing cotton back to a specific farm is almost impossible - there are just too many. Think of the supply chain like a sand-timer: there are hundreds of thousands of farms and almost as many garment factories. The spinning mills in the middle are the pinch point, where the cotton is blended and turned into yarn. Certification schemes for cotton mills, such as Yarn Ethically & Sustainably Sourced (Yess), work to eliminate forced labour from the supply chain. But that's of limited help to you as a consumer if you're just ordering a pair of jeans off a retailer's website. ""If you really want to be confident of the traceability of the cotton in your jeans, you have to look for Soil Association organic cotton or Fairtrade,"" advises Clare Lissaman from Common Objective (CO), a sustainable fashion sourcing platform. What does China say? China rejects the accusations of using forced labour and denies holding Uighurs in detention camps. It says the camps are ""re-education"" facilities being used to combat terrorism. Many Chinese have called for boycotts of Western brands including Nike and H&M after they expressed concern about the alleged use of Uighur forced labour. H&M has been erased from Chinese e-commerce sites including Pinduoduo, JD.com and Tmall. Burberry lost a brand ambassador, actress Zhou Dongyu - and it wasn't the only one. In 48 hours, 27 celebrities cut ties with companies including Adidas, Calvin Klein and Nike. Where is Xinjiang and who are the Uighurs? Read more: Who are the Uighurs? You may also be interested in...","Xinjiang cotton is some of the best fabric in the world. It's also, human rights campaigners say, produced by forced labour. Some Western brands have removed it from their supply chains, leading to a backlash from Chinese celebrities and netizens. Welcome to the row over cotton from the Xinjiang region of China."
"At least 29 others were wounded in the blast in the west of the city, the interior ministry said. Some reports suggest most of those killed and injured were police officers. Earlier reports said most of the dead were civilians. The Taliban said they carried out the bombing - one of a string of attacks in Kabul and elsewhere in recent months. Monday's attack happened at the entrance of the headquarters of the National Civil Order Police, a unit that has a counterinsurgency role against the Taliban. Officials initially blamed a suicide car bomber, but later said the attacker had joined people queuing to get into the police station before he detonated his explosives. ""I saw three dead bodies on the ground and a number of other people wounded, then ambulances arrived and took all the victims away from the attack site,"" one man told Reuters news agency. A spokesman for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan, Brig Gen Wilson Shoffner, said: ""This attack on the Afghan police shows the contempt the Taliban have for the rule of law in Afghanistan and for those who commit themselves daily to defending the Afghan people. ""The Taliban have no plan for the development of Afghanistan. Targeting those who defend their fellow Afghans does not advance the cause of peace."" The bombing follows a spate of attacks in January, one of which killed seven staff from the Tolo media group in Kabul. Several other attacks were near foreign diplomatic missions. There has been speculation that the attacks may be aimed at destabilising attempts to revive peace talks with the Taliban. Others have suggested that the Taliban's winter offensive may be an attempt by their new leader to strengthen his hand in any talks. Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned that if negotiations did not start by April the conflict would intensify, with consequences across the region. ""Time is not a friend,"" he told the BBC. ""We all understand that February and March are crucial.""","A suicide bomber has killed 20 people at a police headquarters in the Afghan capital Kabul, officials say."
"By Rayhan DemytrieBBC News, Tbilisi Fewer than 1,000 cases of Covid-19 have been registered, and 15 people have died out of a population of 3.7 million. A group of public scientists, dubbed the three musketeers, are being praised for steering the Caucasus state's successful response to the pandemic. By comparison, coronavirus has been raging in neighbouring Armenia, a country of similar size. Hundreds of new cases of Covid-19 are being registered there every day, the total number of infections has exceeded 26,000 and the death toll stands at nearly 500. How did Georgia do it? Georgia's first Covid-19 case was registered at the end of February. The government's response was swift. By mid-March all schools, universities and non-essential businesses were closed and public transport was suspended. After the introduction of a state of emergency on 21 March, large gatherings and intra-city travel were banned. Nightly curfews were introduced. During Orthodox Easter, Georgia's most important religious holiday, the authorities banned private transport and closed cemeteries. ""We took note of the pandemic's threat a month before the first confirmed case,"" Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia told the BBC via email. ""Given our country's specifics, such as our location and small size, we could not use the examples of other countries."" An information campaign and regular updates were led by the country's top scientists and Georgia's National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC). The NCDC's Lugar Laboratory has been a constant target of Russian disinformation, which has accused it of being part of a US secret bio-weapons programme. But its scientists have led the country's fight against the pandemic. More from Georgia - and Russia's relations with it Who are the 'musketeers'? In Georgia, the NCDC's scientists have become widely respected for their decision-making. The trio included the head of the NCDC, Amiran Gamkrelidze, the man in charge of the Lugar lab, Paata Imnadze, and the main virologist, Tengiz Tsertsvadze, who is head of Tbilisi's infectious diseases, Aids and immunology research centre. Another popular figure was the face of the public health campaign, Marina Ezugbaia, who is medical head of Tbilisi's infectious diseases hospital. There are now 19 laboratories across Georgia testing for coronavirus. And on 30 June, the head of the NCDC, Amiran Gamrekhelidze, detailed Georgia's success. ""By the gold standard we have made almost 30,000 PCR tests per million of our population. The recovery rate has risen to 86%, but unfortunately we had 15 deaths which represents 1.6%. Compared to global rates it is very low."" Why did it work? Georgia's government has thanked the public for complying with its directives. There have been heavy penalties for those caught breaking the rules during the state of emergency - $1,000 fines for individuals and over $3,000 in fines for violations by businesses. ""Stay at Home"" warnings were digitally displayed at bus stops, and mobile phone operators broadcast the same message on people's devices. Despite a typically high degree of political polarisation, Georgian society broadly supported efforts to combat the epidemic. The prime minister said the co-operation of Georgians and their ""exemplary social responsibility in observing all relevant instructions and recommendations"" had helped flatten the curve of infections. The big test came on Easter Sunday when there were fears that thousands would attend midnight mass services in churches across the country. The country's powerful Orthodox Church went ahead with ceremonies and refused to stop using common spoons for holy communion, but most people followed the advice of the scientists and stayed home. Neighbouring countries Armenia, which (to date) has registered nearly 27,000 cases of Covid-19, started easing lockdown measures at the end of April, gradually reopening the economy in May. Its health minister, Arsen Torosyan, told the BBC that the number of new infections was soaring, but that the country could no longer afford to stay shut. ""We decided to live with the virus regardless of the numbers. We don't have an end goal to eradicate it. Because it is impossible. If we have to close borders for a year, close businesses for months and years we will die from other causes."" Neighbouring Azerbaijan also continues to register hundreds of new cases every day. Its critics have accused the government of using authoritarian methods to fight the pandemic - without success. Images on social media have been widely shared of police dragging people in their underpants from their homes for breaking quarantine. Restrictions lifted Many Georgian businesses and restaurants have reopened. The wearing of masks is obligatory in indoor public spaces and there are tight rules on distancing and restrictions on large gatherings. The Georgian government had been hoping to open its borders for international travellers from 1 July. That has now been postponed, so prospects for the country's tourism sector this year are bleak. The head of the NCDC remains cautious. ""If Georgia looks like an island and an oasis between the surrounding countries, it does not give us the right to rest for a minute,"" Dr Gamrekhelidze told a press briefing on 30 June. ""The fact that we only have daily new cases in single figures doesn't give us the right to relax at all. We need to be in a state of constant readiness.""",Georgia is enjoying the distinction of being included in a list of 15 non-EU states the European Union considers safe enough to open its borders to. It's the only former Soviet republic to achieve that status.
"A floating effigy, a bombshell interview and a meeting with the Queen - all against the backdrop of angry protests. To be honest, it was never going to be your usual visit by a head of state: the initial invitation, for a full state visit, had created so much outrage that it ended up being debated in parliament. So by the time Mr Trump finally touched down - fresh from a Nato summit which had been more than a little tense - the country was braced. Here is how the visit panned out. 1. The arrival Mr Trump and his wife Melania arrived on Air Force One at London Stansted - an airport more used to welcoming budget flights - on Thursday afternoon, fresh from that Nato summit in Brussels. The US First Couple were immediately whisked from the airport to central London, and the official residence of the US Ambassador, Woody Johnson, in Regent's Park. But not for the Trumps the joys - and traffic - of the motorway: they travelled via helicopter. In fact, Mr Trump and his entourage would go on to avoid travelling by road wherever possible, the road convoy travelling from location to location to meet the president as he disembarked from Marine One, his official helicopter. No doubt, this meant the president could travel more quickly and efficiently during a packed schedule. Avoiding protest-lined streets was a bonus too. 2. The dinner Unfortunately, travelling by helicopter did not stop him being a few minutes late reaching Blenheim Palace, where Prime Minister Theresa May was waiting to greet the president, along with 150 other guests. Blenheim Palace, by the way, was where Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill was born - the man whose bust Mr Trump placed back in the Oval Office, and in whose chair he has now sat: When they finally did arrive, they were greeted by marching bands from the Scots, Irish and Welsh guards. This is likely to have gone down well with Mr Trump, as we know he was impressed by a French military band in Paris last year. And if that wasn't enough to impress the president, Mrs May also had a host of thoughtful gifts ready for the Trumps - including an illustrated ancestral chart of his Scottish heritage, President Trump would later rave about how well the dinner - a smoked salmon starter followed by Hereford beef fillet and potatoes (surely a winner with the steak-loving president), topped off with strawberries and cream - had gone. But before it was over, British tabloid The Sun had dropped a bombshell. 3. The interview It came just before 23:00 UK time (22:00 GMT) in a series of tweets from The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn. Her dinner guest telling the world she had ""wrecked Brexit"" was the last thing Mrs May needed after a week in which two of her top cabinet members had resigned over her plan to leave the European Union. The Sun's exclusive also had Mr Trump suggesting Boris Johnson - who had quit as foreign secretary just days before - would make a great prime minister. Securing a good trade deal with the US after the UK leaves the European Union next March is hugely important to Mrs May and to whether Brexit will be a success. Which raised the question: Just how would the prime minister respond to such a slight? 4. The protests Mr Trump did not need to be making any more enemies in the UK. As soon as the visit was confirmed, people angry at the president's policies - ranging from the so-called Muslim ban, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - began to organise. The result was tens of thousands of people gathering in central London to protest against the visit. In fact, Mr Trump's schedule, with all meeting venues kept outside the capital, was arranged with the protests in mind - and it hadn't gone unnoticed by the president. 5. The Trump Baby In particular, it seems he had heard about the ""Trump Baby"", a six-metre (19.7ft) balloon depiction of the property mogul as a nappy (or diaper) wearing infant, complete with mobile and tan lines. More than 10,000 people signed a petition calling for the inflatable to be given permission to fly, although it was not universally popular. Some have described the balloon, which was inflated outside parliament on Friday morning, as ""a disgrace"" and ""disrespectful."" Mr Trump was certainly not happy. ""I guess when they put out blimps to make me feel unwelcome, no reason for me to go to London,"" he told the Sun. To which some protesters responded: that was the point. 6. The spouses Meanwhile, Mrs Trump and Philip May, the prime minister's financier husband, decided to undertake a far less stressful pastime: lawn bowls. But it was not Mrs Trump's skills at the Commonwealth sport which caught the eye of those watching. Rather, it was the 10cm Laboutin heels she was wearing, which - as anyone who has worn a pair of 10cm heels will know - do not mix well with grass. Mrs Trump was also wearing a Victoria Beckham dress, which was seen as a good, diplomatic choice by the former model who found herself in hot water over her choice of jacket on a visit to a migrant child detention centre last month. 7. The press conference Back at Chequers, Mr Trump and Mrs May were ready to face the press - and of course, there was only one question on everyone's lips: was the so-called ""special relationship"" still in good order? Yes of course, President Donald Trump insisted. In fact, it is ""the highest level of special"". He then rolled back on his comments in The Sun interview - which at one point he branded ""fake news"" - saying ""whatever"" the UK does after it leaves the EU is ""OK with me"". Mrs May, meanwhile, apparently shrugged off the highly critical interview, telling the president: ""Don't worry, it's only the press."" 8: The Queen From there, the world's eyes turned to Windsor Castle, where the Queen was waiting to greet Mr and Mrs Trump. Unlike the day before, Mr Trump and his entourage appeared to be on time to meet the 92-year-old monarch, who has some experience in this area, having previously met no fewer than 11 US presidents. We don't know exactly what the trio talked about over tea. However, it has previously been said that the event was the moment that Mr Trump was most looking forward to - and he certainly looks delighted in this picture: 9: Gliding on to the golf course From there, it was on to Scotland and Mr Trump's very own golf course, where he was clearly looking forward to a relaxing round at Trump Turnberry over the weekend. However, no sooner had the president arrived at his hotel and resort in Ayrshire on Friday, than a message arrived from the skies above. ""Trump: Well below par"" - read a banner attached to a paraglider who swooped in to within about 90m (roughly 300 ft) of Mr Trump, who was outside on the terrace of the hotel at the time and swiftly ushered inside. The paraglider stunt, which was organised by the environmental group Greenpeace, breached the no-fly zone at the Turnberry resort, police said. Police Scotland later said that a 55-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the incident.",It has been just days since the whirlwind that is Donald Trump landed in the UK for his first official visit since becoming US president - and what a couple of days it has turned out to be.
"Author Michael Wolff said White House employees believed Mr Trump's ""mental powers were slipping"". His book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, went on sale early despite the president's attempts to block its publication. Mr Trump says the book is ""boring and untruthful"" and Wolff a ""total loser"". He said it was being pushed by the media and others to hurt him. He added in a tweet: ""They should try winning an election. Sad!"" Mr Tillerson - who is alleged to have called Mr Trump a moron last year - told CNN: ""I have no reason to question his mental fitness."" He said Mr Trump was ""not typical of presidents of the past"". ""I think that's well recognised. That's also though why the American people chose him,"" he said. On Saturday, Mr Trump will begin two days of talks with senior Republicans to discuss policy priorities for the coming year. What are the questions on Trump's mental health? In a television interview on Friday, Wolff said ""100% of the people"" around Mr Trump questioned his fitness for office. His book alleges that Mr Trump failed to recognise close friends, and was prone to repeating comments. Wolff said that White House staff described the president as childlike because ""he has the need for immediate gratification. It's all about him... This man does not read, does not listen. He's like a pinball just shooting off the sides."" The president said he had not given Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book. But Wolff responded: ""What was I doing there if he didn't want me to be there? I absolutely spoke to the president... It was not off the record."" He said he had spent a total of three hours with Mr Trump, both during the election campaign and after the inauguration. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Wolff said staff had come to realise ""the emperor has no clothes"". What else is in the book? It cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump election campaign officials, including Mr Trump's son Donald Jr, as ""treasonous"". Both Mr Trump Jr and his father deny that any collusion with Russians to win the election took place. However Mr Bannon is quoted in the book as saying: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" The meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The book makes many other claims, including that: The accuracy of some excerpts has been criticised and questioned in US media. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, says BBC North America editor Jon Sopel. Will it actually hurt Trump? Analysis: BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Donald Trump's supporters have seen many a media storm over the past few years, and somehow their man always emerges (relatively) unscathed. The book may be generating considerable heat among the chattering class, but there's little to indicate that its lasting impact will be much more than confirming long-held suspicions of Trump critics and re-enforcing the bunker mentality in the White House. Outside Washington, in places where people don't devoutly follow every permutation of the presidential Twitter feed, the Trump administration is compiling a boast-worthy economic record. Despite some doom-and-gloom predictions following the 2016 election, the stock market has soared. Unemployment remains low. Major corporations are making high-profile moves to at least temporarily boost their workers' paycheques. And the president can start pointing to his party's tax bill as a tangible reason why the economy is humming along. If the current trajectory continues, Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans will be positioned to make the case to voters in the months and years ahead that despite all the drama - the often self-inflicted fire and fury - their agenda is to help Americans where it counts the most, in their pockets. That's the kind of message that can win. What will happen to Steve Bannon? Mr Trump said Mr Bannon - who was sacked in August - had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position, adding in a tweet that Mr Bannon had cried when he lost his job. Reports suggest that more conservative factions in the Republican party are rallying around Mr Trump. Billionaire conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, who had backed Mr Bannon financially and invested in the right-wing Breitbart news website that he heads, cut ties with the former strategist, and reiterated her support for the president. What else is happening at the White House? Despite the storm over the book, the Trump administration has been pressing ahead with its agenda. On Thursday it: On Friday, Mr Trump refused to answer questions about the book as he departed for Camp David from the White House. Mr Trump will spend two days meeting top Republicans at the retreat to discuss his legislative priorities for the year ahead.",US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says he has never doubted President Trump's mental health after a new book claimed staff saw him as a child.
"Up to 40in (102cm) of snow settled in parts, paralysing rail and air links, and cutting power to 200,000 people. A travel ban in New York, which saw its second highest snowfall on record, is set to be lifted later on Sunday. At least 18 deaths, from road accidents but also snow shovelling, have been blamed on the weather since Friday. The blizzard is now lessening and heading out towards the Atlantic Ocean. In pictures: #snowmageddon2016 What to do if it all goes wrong Why do so many people die shovelling snow? In other developments States of emergency were declared in New York, Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia Traffic jams lasting more than 12 hours were reported in Kentucky and Pennsylvania on Saturday. The heaviest unofficial snowfalls recorded by mid-afternoon on Saturday included New York's Central Park received 26.8in, the second-biggest fall recorded since 1869 and just shy of the all-time high, 26.9in, recorded in February 2006. ""This is going to be one of those generational events, where your parents talk about how bad it was,"" said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics. Under travel restrictions in the most populous US city, transport was suspended and bridges shut. Emergency vehicles and workers carrying out repairs are being allowed to use roads but those driving non-essential vehicles risk being arrested. Five out of six deaths attributed to the snowstorm were of people shovelling snow in New York city or state, the New York Times reports. The sixth was recorded in Maryland. On the Pennsylvania Turnpike, two university sports teams whose buses were marooned with some 500 other vehicles had to turn and head home. Further south in Kentucky, a 35-mile (56km) traffic jam cleared after thousands of drivers found themselves stranded on Interstate 75 by heavy snow and a number of accidents. The Red Cross erected shelters along the highway for those left in the traffic jam. The US federal government closed down at noon on Friday. President Barack Obama is remaining at the White House. Andrew Watson, who moved to Virginia for work about six months ago, told the BBC's News Channel that travel was restricted but families were enjoying the snow. ""The roads are now impassable and where we live it's pretty much a driving town so it's hard to get anywhere right now,"" he said. ""We've been told not to take to the roads, which is smart because the roads aren't gritted at all so they're very treacherous. I mean everyone's making light of it and having fun. The street we're living on the kids are playing out in the street now and having a great time."" Do you live in the eastern US? Are you affected by the blizzard?

"Currently applications are considered by the island's High Bailiff and a panel of magistrates. The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) wants to set up an independent Licensing Authority instead. Views on the planned changes are being sought in a consultation on the modernisation of Manx licensing laws. The DHA said the current licensing regime had become ""outdated, overly bureaucratic and inflexible"". An independently chaired new authority would comprise bodies currently involved in the licensing process, including representatives of the police and fire service. Only appeals over decisions would be heard by the judiciary, saving time and money. The new laws would see the rules governing the sale of alcohol largely remain the same. The legislation would make it possible for minimum unit pricing and below cost price sale restrictions to be gradually introduced in future. It would also see occasional short-term licences, like those granted during the TT, issued for multiple years rather than on an annual basis. The four-week consultation is available online and closes on 18 January. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter? You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk",Decisions over the granting of licences to sell alcohol could be taken out of the hands of the courts under proposals put forward by the Manx government.
"By Grace LivingstoneNeuquen, Argentina This site produces more shale gas than any other place in the world, outside the United States. Fracking could provide Argentina with cheap energy for generations, but Mapuche indigenous communities who live here say it is polluting their land. What is fracking and why is it controversial? Susana Campo is a Mapuche goat farmer. Last year, she says, 60 of her baby goats were born without hair. A week later they died. 'Enslaved land' She thinks fracking has contaminated the groundwater. ""The animals drank the water and then they gave birth to kids with just skin, no hair. That's never happened before."" Her sister Josifa say the water has made her sick. ""I've had stomach aches. I've also vomited. ""We know it's because the water is contaminated, but we have to continue drinking this water. ""Poor people can't afford to buy water."" Albino Campo is the leader, or lonko, of this Mapuche community called Lof Campo Maripe. ""The Mapuche people are angry. We feel like they have enslaved our land. It's as if someone came into your house without asking. ""They have contaminated everything,"" says Mr Campo. His community is an extended family of 125 people living on farms dotted over 11,000 hectares of land, although they only have a legal title to a small part of it. They have lived here since their grandparents migrated from Chile in 1919. There are five other Mapuche communities in this region, together comprising about 1,000 people. Huge investment Fracking involves injecting thousands of litres of water, chemicals and sand deep into the earth at high pressure to release gas. Fracking work began here in 2010 and since then, many foreign oil companies have bought concessions to drill gas wells. US oil company Chevron has invested $2.5bn (£1.9bn) in Vaca Muerta as part of a joint fracking project with Argentina's state-owned oil company YPF. So far, the YPF-Chevron partnership has drilled 420 wells and it plans to drill 200 more over the next two years. The two companies plan to invest a total of $16bn dollars in fracking here. 'No signs of contamination' Turkeys and chickens scurry around a farm belonging to Albino Campo's son. A well in the farmyard contains a long pipe to pump up the water. The pipe is covered with a greasy black substance and when the water is deposited in the bucket there is a greenish-brown residue in the bottom. ""A year ago, this water was crystal clear,"" says Albino Campo. ""This is how it comes out now."" The BBC asked Chevron for a comment but they told us to speak to their operating partner, YPF. Juan Garoby, an executive manager of YPF, says there is no evidence that fracking has contaminated the water. He says that the gas in Vaca Muerta is taken from a depth of 3,000m and the water being drawn by locals is only 300m under the ground so the two are separated by a big expanse of rock and layers of earth. When a well is drilled, the hole is cased in steel and then surrounded with cement. Another two layers of iron casing and cement are then added in order to isolate it from the groundwater. ""There is continuous monitoring of the water by the provincial environmental agency and it has found no signs of contamination,"" he says. According to Mr Garoby, there are no fracked wells near Mapuche animal farms. Untapped potential He also says that Vaca Muerta is a great opportunity for Argentina, a net importer of energy, to become self-sufficient. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that Argentina has the world's largest recoverable reserves of shale gas after China. Pro-government Congressman Eduardo Amadeo also thinks fracking is vital for Argentina's future. ""Argentina needs oil and gas. You cannot stop production for 45 million people because one or two thousand people feel that their rights are affected,"" he says. But Martin Alvarez of the campaign group Observatorio Petrolero Sur says that fracking not only poses an environmental risk to Mapuche communities, but to the wider rural population of 54,000 people in the province and to residents of the provincial capital, Neuquen. The group is calling for a halt to fracking on indigenous territory, farming land, nature reserves, urban areas and sites near water sources such as rivers, lakes and lagoons. Juan Garoby says these restrictions are not necessary because fracking is safe. ""If you take the precautions you need to take and if you are careful about isolating the surface water, there shouldn't be any problem about developing in any area. ""It's just a matter of being conscious and having the right environmental policies in order to have the minimum impact on the environment.""","The deep red craggy hills of Vaca Muerta, or Dead Cow, rise up against the horizon."
"The federal upper house (Bundesrat) took the case to the constitutional court in the western city of Karlsruhe. The petition argues that the NPD is racist and anti-Semitic, and poses a threat to Germany's democratic order. A previous attempt to ban the NPD failed in 2003 because the judges dismissed evidence provided by state agents who had infiltrated the party. The NPD is not represented at national level, but has members in the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state assembly in former East Germany. It also has one seat in the European Parliament, held by former party chief Udo Voigt. NPD members have joined regular ""anti-Islamisation"" marches by the right-wing Pegida organisation, based in Dresden. The NPD's anti-immigrant stance is part of widespread German anxiety about the influx of non-EU migrants, many of them Muslim Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans fleeing war and human rights abuses. Germany severely restricts the power to ban a political party - a legacy of de-Nazification after World War Two. Only the Bundesrat, Bundestag (lower house) or government can launch a banning procedure. And only the constitutional court can impose a ban, if two-thirds of the judges back it. Critics of the new case against the NPD fear that a ban could turn far-right extremists into martyrs. The party has about 5,200 members. There are two post-war precedents for such bans in Germany. The West German authorities banned the Socialist Reich Party in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany in 1957. A banning order forces a party to completely disband and its assets can be seized, the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.",Germany's highest court is considering whether to ban the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD).
"Foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg ""significantly broadened EU restrictive measures"", focusing on Iranian banks, trade and gas exports, officials said. The ministers reiterated their ""serious and deepening concerns"" over Iran's nuclear activities and their commitment to ""work for a diplomatic solution"". They suspect Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, something it denies. Analysts say the unilateral sanctions announced by the US and EU, as well as those imposed by the UN Security Council, have done significant damage to the Islamic Republic's economy. Earlier this month, riots broke out when Iran's currency, the rial, plunged to new lows against the dollar, according to local currency exchange websites, having lost 80% of its value since the start of the year. 'Persuasive' The Council of the European Union said the new sanctions agreed targeted Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and government revenues allocated to them. ""They are meant to persuade Iran to engage constructively by negotiating seriously and addressing the concerns of the international community,"" a statement said. ""The sanctions are not aimed at the Iranian people."" The Council prohibited all transactions between European and Iranian banks, unless they are explicitly authorised by national authorities under strict conditions. There will be a ban on short-term export credits, guarantees and insurance. Medium- and long-term commitments are already banned. The ministers also prohibited the export to Iran of further materials relevant to the Iranian nuclear and ballistic programmes or to industries controlled by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), including graphite, raw or semi-finished metals such as aluminium and steel, as well as software for integrating industrial processes. The import, purchase and transport of natural gas from Iran was also banned, mirroring the more significant embargo on oil imports which came into effect in July. European companies were also forbidden from providing shipbuilding technology and oil storage capabilities, as well as flagging and classification services to Iranian tankers and cargo vessels. Finally, the Council targeted 34 additional Iranian entities allegedly providing substantial financial support to the Iranian government and one person involved in the Iranian nuclear programme with an asset freeze and a travel ban. Those affected will be named on Tuesday. ""The objective of the EU remains to achieve a comprehensive, negotiated, long-term settlement which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme, while respecting Iran's legitimate right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy under the Non-Proliferation Treaty,"" the EU statement said. 'Room for negotiations' The EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, told reporters before Monday's meeting that there was still ""room for negotiations"" between Iran and the P5+1 - the UK, US, France, China, Russia and Germany. The P5+1 have asked Iran to stop enriching uranium to 20%. The Iranian government says it requires 20% enriched uranium for its medical research reactor in Tehran, but Western experts say it could be converted to weapons-grade material within six months. Meanwhile, Sweden has summoned Israel's ambassador in Stockholm. The move came after an Israeli foreign ministry official was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper as saying the Swedish government would oppose further sanctions to protect a deal between the telecommunications group, Ericsson, and the mobile operator, Irancell. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt condemned the ""mudslinging"", telling the TT news agency: ""This is not how I think mature nations should interact with each other and I will react quite sharply against Israel."" In a separate development on Monday, the leading European satellite provider Eutelsat took 19 Iranian state-run television and radio channels off air on Monday, citing ""reinforced EU Council sanctions"". People in the Middle East will still have access to most of the channels operated by Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (Irib) - including English-language news service, Press TV, and Arabic-language al-Alam - but they will no longer be available in Europe except via the internet.",EU member states have announced a new package of sanctions against Iran over its controversial nuclear programme.
"Both houses of Congress voted in quick succession to approve the deal, as well as pacts with Panama and South Korea. President Barack Obama said the deals were ""a major win for American workers and businesses"". But the accords, signed several years ago, were controversial both in the US and in the respective countries. President Santos said the vote was hugely significant for his country. ""Today is a historic day for relations between Colombia and the United States,"" he said. ""The free trade agreement ends the uncertainty that has been discouraging long-term investment and it now guarantees to all investors stability in the rules of the game."" But the head of Colombian trade union federation, the CUT, said the economy was not ready to compete. ""Our country isn't developed, it does not have the expertise much less the requirements for trade at this level,"" Tarsicio Mora told the Associated Press news agency. Ready to trade The Colombian deal, highlighting concerns among some Democrats about labour conditions in Colombia, had the least support in Congress of the three accords. ""I find it deeply disturbing that the United States Congress is even considering a free trade agreement with a country that holds the world record for the assassinations of trade unionists,"" said Congresswoman Maxine Waters. All three accords were signed during President George W Bush's administration. But concerns over tariffs, overseas labour practices and the effect of increased competition on US jobs meant the deals languished for several years before being put to a vote. The deal with South Korea was the biggest US trade pact since it signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico and Canada in 1994. Panama's government said their deal was a key for their economic policies which seek to increase foreign investment. ""We Panamanians have to be ready to take advantage of the benefits of this agreement,"" President Ricardo Martinelli said in a statement. The Obama administration says the deals will increase US exports by $13bn (£8bn) a year.","Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has hailed a ""historic day"" after the US Congress passed a long-delayed free trade agreement with Colombia."
"An internet watchdog based in Canada, Citizen Lab, said the surveillance software is only sold to governments. Last week, Citizen Lab also said that 12 journalists and human rights lawyers had been targeted. At the time, the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, described accusations that the government was involved as false. Mr Peña Nieto said surveillance software was only used for matters of national security and for fighting organised crime. He added that he had ordered an investigation by the attorney general's office. Citizen Lab said the head of the Conservative National Action Party (PAN), Ricardo Anaya, a PAN Senator, Roberto Gil Zuarth, and the party's communications secretary, Fernando Rodriguez, were targeted. ""There is strong circumstantial evidence implicating the government of Mexico"", the watchdog said. The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by the Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists. It is usually sent in a text message to a smartphone. If the person taps on it, the spyware is installed, and huge amounts of private data - text messages, photos, emails, location data, even what is being picked up by the device's microphone and camera - are hacked.","Three senior opposition politicians in Mexico have been targeted by spyware on their mobile phones, researchers say."
"The court came down heavily on federal and state governments over what it sees as a failure to curb pollution levels. On Monday, one judge said: ""Get explosives in 15 bags and kill them in one go. Why should people suffer this?"" Thick pollution has blanketed parts of northern India for weeks, with Delhi recording ""hazardous"" air quality levels. On Monday, the air quality index figures in Delhi reached 339. A good level is considered anything between zero and 50. Levels are expected to dip with rainfall predicted to hit the capital over the coming days. The judges said it held the federal and local governments responsible for failing to control crop burning by farmers in Delhi and neighbouring states. At this time of year, farmers tend to burn crop stubble to clear their fields, contributing to the high pollution levels. Vehicle fumes, as well as construction and industrial emissions, have also contributed to the smog over the past month. The court said the lifespan of millions of people had been shortened and that people in Delhi and the surrounding region are ""suffocating"" due to pollution. It called on Delhi's government to come up with a plan to install air purifying towers across the city within 10 days. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says a third of deaths from lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. Pakistan is also suffering from high levels of pollution. Amnesty International has called for its supporters around the world to campaign on behalf of the people of the Pakistani city of Lahore. ""The government's inadequate response to the smog in Lahore raises significant human rights concerns. The hazardous air is putting everyone's right to health at risk,"" says Rimmel Mohydin, South Asia campaigner at Amnesty International. The government there has shut schools down on at least three days this month.","India's Supreme Court has said the world is ""laughing at India"" over its air pollution issues."
"Deputy party leader Christos Pappas had been sought alongside five other MPs who were held a day earlier. In all 22 people have been held amid anger over the murder on 18 September of anti-racist musician, Pavlos Fyssas. A man held for the stabbing told police he was a Golden Dawn supporter, though the party strongly denies any link. It is alleged he spoke to Golden Dawn MPs after the attack. Earlier on Sunday, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, Golden Dawn's leader, was charged with belonging to a criminal organisation. Police earlier said they found three pistols, ammunition and thousands of euros in cash at Mr Michaloliakos's home. Other charges against some of those held include assault and money laundering. The latest arrest came as details emerged of the careful planning behind Greece's unprecendented clampdown on neo-Nazis. According to Greek media reports, several police officers thought to have had links to Golden Dawn were suspended ahead of the operation to prevent them potentially tipping off the targets. Greek police also arrested one of their own colleagues who was reportedly working as a bodyguard for the party, during a raid on its offices in the western town of Agrinio on Tuesday. 'Shame on them' The MPs arrested on Saturday were party spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, Ilias Panayiotaros, Nikos Michos and Ioannis Lagos. It is the first time since 1974 that a party leader and MPs have been arrested. Justice ministry officials will now have to decide whether to keep the suspects in custody until any trial, BBC Athens correspondent Mark Lowen reports. Mr Panayiotaros told reporters before giving himself up on Saturday: ""Shame on them, the people will lift Golden Dawn higher."" Golden Dawn issued a rallying call via a text message, saying: ""We call upon everyone to support our moral and just struggle against the corrupt system!"" Its call for members to gather outside the police headquarters in Athens was answered by some 200 supporters who chanted slogans and waved Greek flags. Resignations and suspensions The murder of Mr Fyssas, 34 - whose stage name was Killah P - had sparked protests in Athens and across Greece. George Roupakias, 45, who said he was a supporter of Golden Dawn, was arrested. He was charged with voluntary manslaughter and illegal possession of a weapon. The government then launched a crackdown, including raids on Golden Dawn premises. The government also began an inquiry into the activities of Golden Dawn, which won nearly 7% of the vote in 2012 elections. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has vowed not to let the party ""undermine"" democracy, and government officials say it must now be treated as a ""criminal organisation"". Golden Dawn has accused the government of carrying out a witch-hunt over the killing of Mr Fyssas. On Friday, Golden Dawn threatened to pull its 18 MPs out of the 300-strong Hellenic Parliament. Mr Samaras's coalition, which has 155 seats, would then face by-elections. Our correspondent says if Golden Dawn does pull out its MPs it could be the beginning of the end of any political representation for the party in the future. In recent months, Golden Dawn has been accused of perpetrating attacks on migrants and political opponents - including an attack on Communist Party members earlier this month which is said to have left nine people in hospital. Golden Dawn officially denies being a neo-Nazi movement, though its badge resembles a swastika, some senior members have praised Adolf Hitler, and its members wear black T-shirts and combat trousers at anti-immigrant demonstrations.",A sixth politician from Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party has been arrested after handing himself in to police in Athens.
"""At least we still have France,"" many people have joked on social media. Even French President Emmanuel Macron has got in on the act, telling Nigerians yesterday that now the Super Eagles are out of the World Cup, they should support France. Indeed, France has 14 players in the squad who would be able to play for an African country. Two French players have siblings who do so. Paul Pogba's brother, Florentin, plays for Guinea, while Steve Mandanda's brother, Parfait, plays for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Both previously played for France's national youth teams before opting to represent the countries where their parents came from. France's breakout star of the competition so far, 19-year-old striker Kylian Mbappé, was born to a Cameroonian father and French-Algerian mother. Belgium, meanwhile, has eight players of African parentage - with either one or both parents hailing from the continent. They are Kompany, Fellaini, Lukaku, Dembélé, Boyata, Batshuayi, Chadli and Tielemans. Fifa's nationality rules You may also like: Home from home: Footballers who chose to play for another country The making of Paul Pogba Sweden's Kenya connection Also left in the competition are England, Sweden, Uruguay, Brazil, Russia and Croatia. Players of known African parentage are England's Delle Alli - whose father hails from Nigeria - and his team-mate Danny Welbeck who was born in Manchester to Ghanaian parents. Perhaps Sweden's African connections are lesser-known. Sweden's John Guidetti lived in Kenya for three years as a child, showing early promise as player with Nairobi youth team Ligi Ndogo. Delighted Kenyan football fans have been sharing this image of the young Guidetti on social media: ""I still have a strong link with Kenya and every time I go back there I always get a warm welcome,"" Guidetti is quoted as saying by Kenya's Standard newspaper. Guidetti's former coach, Chris Amimo, told the same newspaper that Guidetti ""always made it to the team's starting line-up. He loved playing. ""His father used to work at the Swedish School which is directly opposite Ligi Ndogo grounds,"" he added. While Guidetti would fail in Fifa's eligibility test for Kenya by two years, his Sweden team-mate Martin Olsson was born to a Kenyan mother and so would in theory have had the choice between the two countries. But it reality, footballers' professional prospects often trump questions of national allegiance. ""Those professional prospects are often improved by playing international football,"" says BBC Africa Sport's Nick Cavell, ""and that means that plenty of players born or raised in European countries commit to play for African teams. ""Indeed just six of the 23-man Morocco squad at the 2018 World Cup were born in the country.""","Hearts were broken when all five African nations - Senegal, Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia - crashed out in the first stage of the World Cup - but some fans say hope is not lost."
"The route, operated by Guernsey's national airline Aurigny, saw a 3% increase in passenger numbers in 2018-19. The number of people using the Southampton service rose from 11,619 in 2017-18 to 11,968. It compares to a 7% fall in the number of flights operated by the airline from 2,726 to 2,584 in the same period. The connection is expected to see further flight reductions as one of Aurigny's three Dorniers will be taken out of service this year. A further 7,000 seats are due to be cut from April to September 2020, according to the States of Alderney. The figures form part of the first report to profile passengers arriving in Alderney via ferry or plane. The direct Southampton service accounted for 46% of the 26,177 air passengers who arrived in the island between October 2018 and September 2019. A total of 392 Alderney residents were recorded as requiring the flight path for medical treatment. Christian Harris, States of Alderney Chairman of the committee for tourism and economic development, said the findings were ""hard evidence"" of the importance of the Southampton link.

"By Milton NkosiBBC News, Johannesburg It was when another student picked up the dying 13-year-old Hector Pieterson that Nzima clicked to take one of the most iconic photographs in history, becoming a symbol of the brutality of the white minority regime, which flashed around the world. In a 2010 BBC interview, Nzima, who has died aged 83, recalled: ""I didn't know who it was. I saw a child falling down. ""I rushed there with my camera. ""And I saw another young man pick him up and as soon as he had picked him up, I started shooting the pictures. ""It was a very high risk because this picture was taken under a shower of bullets,"" he said. The self-taught photographer Born in August 1934, Nzima, the son of a farm labourer, was fascinated by photography after a teacher at school had shown him how to use his camera. A young Nzima bought his own camera and began taking pictures in the world renowned Kruger National Park. But his own story also illustrated the injustice of the apartheid regime which the students were protesting against. His father's employer, a white farmer, forced him to work in the Eastern Transvaal, now known as Mpumalanga. After nine months' hard labour, he ran away to the country's commercial hub Johannesburg, where he found a job as a gardener in one of the posh suburbs. In 1956 he was employed as a waiter at the Savoy Hotel and began to take portraits of his fellow workers. He continued honing his skills even after he moved to the Chelsea Hotel and that's where he began reading the Rand Daily Newspaper. He was transfixed by stories that were critical of the apartheid government written by the late award-winning journalist and editor Allister Sparks in the newspaper. Nzima started sending his own pictures to The World newspaper and also submitted a story he had compiled while travelling on a bus. The editor was so impressed with his work that he employed him as a full-time staff photojournalist in 1968. In 1976, high-school students began to protest against being forced to study in Afrikaans - seen as the language of the apartheid regime. This breathed new life into what had become a lethargic struggle against white minority rule. The government reacted with brutal force and hundreds of people were killed on that cold Wednesday morning in South Africa's largest township, Soweto. I was in the crowds and the singing of anti-apartheid liberation songs was powerful. I saw students with clinched fists raised to the air chanting Black Power. When the police fired into the crowds, who like me were wearing school uniforms, it was terrifying. It was the very first time I smelled tear gas and saw a trail of white smoke shoot into the air against a blue sky and coming down to choke us. But it was Nzima's internationally acclaimed photograph that came to symbolise the protests after it was published on the front pages of major newspapers around the world. Soon after the uprising, the white minority regime placed Nzima under house arrest for 19 months just for taking that picture. Time Magazine listed Nzima's iconic photograph as one of the 100 most influential images of all time. But it was only in 1998 that he finally won a long legal battle to own the copyright of the photograph which he had taken. It is believed that until then the picture's copyright belonged to the institutions he worked for. Nzima's son Thulani said this delay cost his father huge amounts of money. ""By the time we got the copyright, those who wanted to use the image for commercial purposes had already extracted the value,"" he said. ""The second thing is that it took about 18 years for even our own government to finally recognise Sam Nzima as the man behind the picture, while he is still alive. ""In that time, we have seen various applications of the picture, some without even asking for copyrights, and I'm talking even from our government structures."" You may also like: It is not known how much money he could have earned had his rights to the photograph been recognised from the start but his ultimate success in the courts did not lead to much of a pay-out. He owned a village liquor store, and was not a wealthy man when he passed away. He also served as a local councillor in Mpumalanga. 'The camera was an extension of his body' Nzima was honoured with the bronze National Order of Ikhamanga on Freedom Day in 2011, when the president bestows South Africa's highest honours to individuals who have contributed to the betterment of the republic. ""This means a lot to me and my family,"" he said at the time. ""I had so many awards in my life but this will be very close to my heart because it will be coming from the president of the country."" President Cyril Ramaphosa, one of the anti-apartheid struggle's student activists, also sent his condolences. In a statement he said: ""Sam Nzima was one of a kind. ""We will especially remember his iconic photograph of a dying young Hector Pieterson, which became a symbol of resistance against the imposition of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in the black schools."" An old friend of Nzima's, Prof Somadoda Fikeni said: ""Sam Nzima was humility personified. He was always down to earth and he inspired me to finish my own photography course."" ""I do think that a click of one image, which became iconic, was the best way to speak a million words to the world as to what was happening behind the iron curtain of apartheid,"" Mr Fikeni told local media. Veteran journalist Thami Mzwai who worked with Nzima in the 1970s, including covering Steve Biko's funeral together, said: ""He was a rare breed of a photo-journalist. ""The camera was an extension of his body. ""It automatically clicked. ""The image became a living testimony of what the journalist was writing about because the apartheid police were very quick to deny their acts of brutality."" He also did his best to inspire the next generation of photographers by setting up a photography school in Mpumalanga.",South African photographer Sam Nzima dashed to the scene of a shooting during the June 1976 students' uprising against apartheid just in time to see a child falling to the ground.
"Border authorities have instead been issuing visas on separate pieces of paper and stamping those issued previously as invalid. Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan have objected to the map because it shows disputed islands in the South China Sea to be a part of China. India is also embroiled a row over the map's inclusion of disputed areas. Official Chinese maps have long shown Taiwan and the South China Sea to be part of its own territory despite ongoing disputes with its neighbours. China's Communist party newspaper, The People's Daily, said that Vietnam and other neighbours were trying to contain China with help from the United States. Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan have already complained to China about the map on the new passport, which they say is an infringement of their sovereignty. The potentially oil-rich Paracel islands, claimed by Vietnam and also claimed by Taiwan, appear on the map, as do the Spratly islands, part of which are claimed by the Philippines. India, which disputes two Himalayan regions also claimed by China that is included on the map, is stamping its own map on visas it issues to Chinese citizens. Meanwhile, the Philippines is still currently accepting the new Chinese passports while it considers its options, says Foreign Ministry spokesman Raul Hernandez.

"They are full of praise for a king credited with smoothing Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy. But there is also agreement that Prince Felipe faces challenges ahead, both in restoring the monarchy's prestige and in confronting some pressing political issues. ""The monarch who smoothed the path to democracy has given up the crown to further its modernisation,"" says centre-left daily El Pais in a front-page piece titled ""A necessary king"". ""Prince Felipe will now have to win the confidence of Spaniards, building on qualities shown by his father and facilitating the modernisation that Spain urgently needs,"" it says. ""Felipe VI takes over in the midst of an institutional crisis,"" is centre-right El Mundo's headline. It hails Felipe as ""the best guarantee"" that the prestige of the monarchy can be restored in a Spain which it describes as being ""at a crossroads"". ""The first political reactions were a good indication of the difficult crossroads the country finds itself at. While the [governing] Popular Party and [opposition] Socialist Party supported the king's decision and showed their support to the prince, [Catalan leader] Artur Mas confirmed from Catalonia that the abdication does not slow down the process of independence,"" it says. ""If Juan Carlos had to invent a modern constitutional monarchy in Spain in 1975, Felipe will have to reinvent it,"" the paper says, while also lauding Juan Carlos's handover of the reins of the monarchy as a ""last great service"" to his country. ""A model king to the end,"" agrees conservative La Razon in its editorial. ""The fact that the king's abdication is not an institutional or social issue for Spain is the greatest praise there can be of his regal nature and the final summing up of his political work, which is without paragon in recent history,"" it says. ""Felipe VI's time has come"", proclaims the front page of Barcelona's La Vanguardia, adding that the king's announcement took even Prince Felipe by surprise. ""A new political, institutional and social stage begins. Without doubt, we are at a very important moment in the history of democratic Spain, decisive for the future,"" it says.

"Eight-year-old Nikita Vasava was on her way to a farm on Wednesday in Vadigam village when the leopard attacked her. The leopard was trapped in a cage, but angry villagers set the cat on fire. Leopards and other big cats have been known to stray into populated areas, and conservationists have warned that such confrontations may increase as humans encroach on animal habitats. Forest official RS Gadhvi told the BBC's Ankur Jain that forest workers had trapped the leopard hours after the girl was killed. ""We laid seven cages around the village and trapped the big cat. But angry locals came with cans of fuel and torched the cage with the big cat inside. Forest officials guarding the cage where shooed away,"" he said. There have been several instances of man-animal conflict in India in recent years. Alarming In July, a group of men killed a leopard with sticks and stones in Gujarat's Rojmal village. With 1,395 leopards, Gujarat has the second highest population of the cats in the country. More than a third of these cats live close to human habitation. Last year, more than a dozen people, mostly farm workers, were killed and over 100 were injured in leopard attacks. In many villages of Gujarat, people light small fires while working on fields to keep the cats away. In February, a male leopard entered a school in the city of Bangalore and injured six people trying to capture it. And in October last year, a male leopard spent five hours with its head stuck in a metal pot in a village in the northern state of Rajasthan.",A caged leopard died when it was set on fire by a mob hours after it had killed a girl in India's Gujarat state.
"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Mr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an ""example to the world in international co-operation"". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted ""vaccine diplomacy"". Mr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100. The euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was ""bending the Covid infection curve"". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was ""breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight"". Mr Modi was called a ""vaccine guru"". At the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat. In less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to a report by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission. India is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. ""They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,"" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences. Even India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive and administered more than 100 million doses by last week, vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand. Meanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was being played behind closed doors every evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies and attending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. ""It is beyond surreal, what is happening,"" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me. Experts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India. In mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants. By the end of the month, the BBC reported the surge and asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. ""We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,"" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time. Experts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in ""beating"" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. ""As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,"" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg. India's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to ""accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low"". Nobody quite took notice. ""There was a feeling of triumphalism,"" said K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,"" he said. A second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have ""postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,"" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of these variants could be driving the surge. ""We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,"" Mr Menon added. ""This was a significant turning point."" What are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow. ""We cant freeze human life,"" Professor Reddy said. ""If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.""","In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was ""in the endgame"" of the Covid-19 pandemic."
"Why are Israel and Iran enemies? Ever since the Iranian revolution in 1979, when religious hardliners came to power, Iran's leaders have called for Israel's elimination. Iran rejects Israel's right to exist, considering it an illegitimate occupier of Muslim land. Israel sees Iran as a threat to its existence and has always said Iran must not get a nuclear weapon. Its leaders are worried by Iran's expansion in the Middle East. What has Syria got to do with it? Israel has watched anxiously as its neighbour Syria has been consumed by war since 2011. Israel has stayed out of the fighting between the Syrian government and rebels. But Iran has played a bigger and bigger role backing Syria's government by sending thousands of fighters and military advisers. Israel is also worried that Iran is trying to secretly send weapons to fighters in Lebanon - Israel's neighbour - who also threaten Israel. Israel's prime minister has repeatedly said that his country would not let Iran create bases in Syria which could be used against Israel. So as Iran has become stronger in Syria, Israel has intensified its strikes on Iranian targets there. Have Iran and Israel ever actually been at war? No. Iran has long backed groups which target Israel - such as Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant organisation Hamas. But a direct war would be massively destructive for both sides. Iran has an arsenal of long-range missiles and heavily armed allies on Israel's borders. Israel has a very strong army and is said to have nuclear weapons. It is also solidly backed by the United States.",Israel has bombed Iranian targets inside Syria - leading to fears confrontations between the two powerful arch-foes could get worse. Here's the background to what is happening.
"Every school holiday, the train would pick up Daria Atkinson and her four siblings, all aged under 10, and transport them - along with thousands of other Aboriginal children from the countryside - to Melbourne, where they would spend up to two months living with a white family. ""We had to call the adults mum and dad,"" recalls Ms Atkinson, now 56. ""We were told how to sit at the table, how to eat properly. We weren't allowed to get dirty. We had to forget we were Aboriginal. But at least we got to go home - the Stolen Generations didn't."" Having experienced first-hand one of Australia's misguided assimilation programs, Ms Atkinson now works with members of the Stolen Generations in Victoria - people who were permanently separated from their families. Many of them are still trying to reconnect with their community, culture and traditional country. The quest has acquired a new urgency as Victoria paves the way for treaty discussions with the state's Aboriginal population - the first Australian jurisdiction to seek a formal agreement with its original inhabitants. What is a treaty in this context? Next year will see the creation of a statutory Aboriginal Representative Body intended to be the voice of indigenous Victoria, which will hammer out ground rules for treaty negotiations in conjunction with the state government. It has taken nearly three years of sometimes acrimonious consultations and more than $37m Australian dollars (£21m; $27m) of public funds just to get to this point. Now controversy surrounds the representative body, where - under an official model - 11 of the 28 seats would be reserved for officially acknowledged ""language nations"" which occupied particular regions before European settlement. There were, however, 38 such nations before colonisation. ""So the other 27 will have to fight over the leftovers,"" says Gary Murray, an Aboriginal elder, referring to the remaining 17 seats, to be decided via an election of all Aboriginal residents. ""And that's discriminatory."" Also potentially problematic is that only ""traditional owners"" - proven descendants of a language nation or clan (extended family) - will be eligible to stand in the election, or participate in eventual treaty talks, or share in benefits flowing from a treaty. That means that some of the ""stolen"" people could be, in a significant way, excluded from the treaty process - a process that indigenous Australians have been demanding for decades, and which they hope will deliver them social justice and economic self-sufficiency while helping to heal the wounds of the past. Meanwhile, there is a more immediate issue: a state election this Saturday, which could lead to the process being junked, if the Labor government of Premier Daniel Andrews loses power. In South Australia, the conservative Liberal government abandoned treaty negotiations with three Aboriginal nations after winning an election in March. The Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, is opposed to a state-based treaty, arguing that ""a national approach would be a much better way to go"". Australia is the only Commonwealth country yet to conclude a treaty with its First Nations, although the subject has been debated on and off for years. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised a treaty in 1988. With progress stalled at the federal level, several states and territories have embarked on their own treaty process. First off the block, in February 2016, was Victoria - where Mr Andrews' government has discovered how protracted and tortuous the process can be, even for just one state. ""It's mind-blowing, the amount of work that has gone into this to date,"" says Janine Coombs, one of the traditional owners on the Aboriginal Treaty Working Group, which advises the Victorian Treaty Advancement Commissioner. That work has included four state-wide forums, dozens of regional community consultations and ""roadshows"", a six-day ""community assembly"" in Melbourne, and legislation enshrining the route to treaty talks, which the government hopes would discourage an incoming Liberal administration from jettisoning the process. The election for the representative body, to take place across six voting regions, has thrown up multiple challenges. Should, for instance, traditional owners from interstate, now living in Victoria, be able to stand? What about indigenous Victorians living elsewhere - in some cases just across the Murray River, which forms a boundary with New South Wales? And how will the vexed question of who is eligible to vote - who is, in fact, Aboriginal - be settled? In Tasmania, in the early 2000s, bitter legal battles were fought over this issue, with the dominant Aboriginal community challenging the right of more than 1,000 people to vote in elections for an Aboriginal statutory authority. The difficulties involved in setting up a representative body in Victoria - in unifying all the disparate Aboriginal voices - are a legacy of the state's colonial history, which saw indigenous groups pushed off their land and dispersed to distant missions and reserves. Policies which later created the Stolen Generations severed yet more links with family, community and territory, resulting in a small, fragmented population which today numbers about 50,000. As in other southern states which were swiftly and brutally settled, most Aboriginal Victorians have mixed ancestry. Model criticised as 'symbolic genocide' The proposed model for the representative body, Ms Coombs believes, is the ""fairest and most inclusive possible"", with additional seats to be made available as more language nations complete a formal recognition process. Mr Murray, though, says that not giving automatic representation to all 38 nations is ""offensive, repugnant and symbolic genocide"". And he warns that if the model is not amended, he and other vocal opponents will lodge complaints with state and national anti-discrimination authorities. Treaty negotiations could still be years off, but they promise to be extraordinarily complex, with up to 100 different clan groups seeking separate treaties and, in some cases, disputing each other's territorial boundaries and ancestry. Nonetheless, some hope the Victorian process could kick-start a momentum that will lead to a federal treaty. Ms Coombs says: ""This isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. The here and now is about setting the foundations and structures right, so that my grandsons and the next seven generations will get the outcomes and benefits. ""Because this opportunity may never come around again.""",Australia is the only Commonwealth country never to make a treaty with its indigenous peoples. Why has it proven so difficult? Kathy Marks looks at the vast challenges in Victoria alone - a state that is working towards a national first.
"By Karen AllenSouthern Africa correspondent, BBC News ""I saw a woman in a field being carried off on a stretcher with her leg blown off,"" he says. One of the men trailing behind was carrying a fragment of what he would learn later was an anti-personnel mine. Trying to ensure others did not face the same pain and misery would become his life's work. As a young Mozambican growing up during the civil war in the late 70s and early 80s, Joao saw first hand how his country, like many others at the time, found itself embroiled in the enmities of the Cold War, fuelling its own internal conflicts. As he trained as a de-miner, it was no surprise to come across mines from the US, China, Russia, Hungary and Portugal littered in strategic positions to either protect infrastructure and key installations or deny territory to the ""enemy"". Joao describes in graphic detail the first time he identified a mine. It was about 08:00 and he picked up a signal from his metal detector under one of the many bridges heavily fortified in the north of the country. ""I was about to cry, I was so terrified,"" he says. It was a time when some 600 casualties a year were being reported as a result of landmines in Mozambique. That figure dipped down to just over a dozen in the last years of mine clearance. Two decades later, Joao's tears are now of relief that the last known anti-personnel mine has been removed from Mozambican soil and his children can grow up in a mine-free land. So what are the lessons Mozambique can offer to the world? The first lesson is that ""it is possible to clear a whole country"", according to Calvin Ruysen, head of Africa for the Halo Trust. ""The second is coordination,"" he adds. Dr Alberto Augusto, the director of Mozambique's National Institute for De-mining, agrees it is undoubtedly the coordination between the government and the humanitarian operators and the commitment to get the job done that has enabled Mozambique to achieve mine-free status. The way the government and its partners ""deal with communities living with mines around them"" is also critical, he says. Organisations such as the Halo Trust, which have been responsible for 80% of mine clearance in Mozambique, have trained and employed thousands of de-miners from the very communities affected. It more or less guarantees huge buy-in and an enduring incentive to recover roads, dams and fields, contaminated by landmines and re-engage them in productive activity. Ottawa convention Some 162 states globally have signed the Mine Ban Treaty known as the Ottawa convention on the prohibition and destruction of anti-personnel mines, which came into force in 1999. It is a commitment to destroy all stockpiles and work to clear sites contaminated by mines. Non-signatories to the Mine Ban Treaty: Armenia; Azerbaijan; Bahrain; Burma; China; Cuba; Egypt; Micronesia; Georgia; India; Iran; Israel; Kazakhstan; North Korea; South Korea; Kyrgyzstan; Laos; Lebanon; Libya; Mongolia; Morocco; Nepal; Pakistan; Russia; Saudi Arabia; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Syria; Tonga; UAE; US; Uzbekistan; Vietnam Mozambique signed the treaty at the outset but, like many other states, found a 10-year commitment unrealistic and had to request extensions to several deadlines in order to complete its work. Like Mozambique, many countries are emerging from conflict and need to build transitional governments from scratch before they can begin the gritty task of removing mines from the ground. The most heavily mined areas on the planet in terms of land mass, remain Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia and Turkey and ""very probably Iraq"", which are classified as having ""massive anti-personnel mine contamination"", according to data from the Landmine Monitor. Mines are still manufactured but in much smaller quantities than before the mine-ban treaty came into existence. Last year saw a dramatic milestone when the US was removed from the list of mine producing countries. The Landmine Monitor believes ""active production"" may be on-going in as many as four countries: India, Myanmar, Pakistan and South Korea. Much to do Mines may have been cleared from Mozambique, but there is still work to be done. Just across the border in Zimbabwe, where many Mozambicans regularly travel to trade, there remains a thick belt of anti-personnel mines. Accidents caused by unexploded bombs also continue, with a number of child casualties reported just a few weeks ago, and the Halo Trust is now in discussions with the government of Mozambique about clearing former military ammunition depots, according to Mr Ruysen. In countries such as Afghanistan, where old Soviet mines continue to litter the countryside, you quickly discover that the world for ""mine"" and ""roadside bomb"" are used interchangeably by civilians and the Afghan National Security Forces, causing considerable confusion. As landmine production and contamination wane and armed militias employ more guerrilla-style tactics, using trip wires, booby traps and roadside bombs detonated by mobile phones to intimidate, maim and kill, the type of help conflict countries require is changing. Assistance and training in clearing these types of deadly weapons are likely to eventually become the mainstay of mine-clearing charities' activities. And as conflicts continue in Syria, Iraq, Central and South Asia, de-miners are unlikely to be done out of a job.",Joao Madamol was just 11 years old when he witnessed the sheer terror and insanely random nature of anti-personnel mines.
"The former US president has been refusing to release the documents for several years, despite a precedent that presidential candidates should do so. A lower court had earlier ruled that the records were pertinent to a criminal investigation. The ruling does not necessarily mean the files will be made public. The financial documents should be provided as evidence to a grand jury to be scrutinised in secret, and might only later become public as part of an indictment. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution. The jury is given investigative powers and can issue subpoenas to compel people to testify. The US Supreme Court's decision is a blow to Mr Trump, who has been in a legal battle to protect his records from a grand jury for months. Last July, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr Trump's financial records could be examined by prosecutors in New York. But lawyers representing Mr Trump challenged that ruling, suggesting that the court filing was ""wildly overbroad"" and issued in bad faith. On Monday, the court rejected the lawyers' argument. According to US media, this was the last opportunity for the former president, who left the White House last month ahead of President Joe Biden's inauguration, to keep the records private. Mr Trump has continuously denied wrongdoing and has called the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"". In a statement on Monday, Mr Trump accused New York prosecutors of unfairly targeting him and said that the Supreme Court ""never should have let this 'fishing expedition' happen"". What's the background to this? Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, has been trying for months to obtain eight years' worth of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns. Mr Vance has been investigating allegations surrounding the payment of hush money before the 2016 presidential election to two women who said they had had sexual relationships with Mr Trump. The district attorney has said that the tax returns and financial records are pertinent to the case. It is alleged that the payments were made by Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Mr Trump denies the affairs took place and described the Supreme Court's ruling last July as ""purely political"". Lawyers for Mr Vance later said the inquiry would extend beyond purported hush money payments. They cited newspaper articles about supposed bank and insurance fraud at the Trump Organization and congressional testimony by Cohen, who said the former president would devalue his assets when trying to reduce his taxes. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Richard Nixon in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public.",Donald Trump has been ordered by the US Supreme Court to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York.
"The children were aged three to 14, reports French media. Three adults and a seven-year-old child are in hospital in a serious condition following the accident on Monday evening. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a tribute to the family. ""I share the immense pain of the relatives of the victims. My thoughts are also with those injured and all those who support them,"" Mr Macron wrote. An investigation has been opened to establish if the incident was caused by a technical failure or lack of vehicle maintenance, according to French media. At least 53 firefighters attended the scene of the accident, as well as three helicopters to transfer the survivors to a hospital in Lyon for patients with severe burns, reports France Bleu. The nine family members, from the suburbs of nearby Lyon, were travelling in a minivan intended for seven people, Valence prosecutor Alex Perrin said. It appears that the driver lost control of the vehicle after which it rolled over three or four times and caught fire, Mr Perrin said. The intense blaze has made identification of the deceased children difficult, he added. Before he lost consciousness, the driver told witnesses he had had difficulty braking, the prosecutor suggested. Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin thanked the emergency workers who attended the scene. ""Strong emotion following the terrible accident on the A7 in Drôme.

"Soutik BiswasDelhi correspondent Twenty four years later, the essay, Three Hundred Ramayanas:Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation, finds itself at the centre of a fresh controversy. It has been dropped from the history syllabus of Delhi University after protests from hardline Hindu groups and a number of teachers. They believe the many versions recounted in the essay offend Hindu beliefs. As Dr Ramanujan tells the story, the number of versions of the epic which have existed in India and the rest of south-east Asia for the past 2,500 years or more is simply ""astonishing"". Though Valmiki's Sanskrit poem Ramayana is the most influential among Indians, Ram's story is available in at least 22 languages, including Chinese, Laotian, Thai and Tibetan. Many of these languages have more than one telling of the epic. Popular epic Twenty-five or more renditions of the epic in various genres - epics, poems, mythological stories - have been in Sanskrit alone, wrote Dr Ramanujan. There are sculptures, mask plays, puppet plays and shadow plays around the epic. One researcher, Camille Bulcke, counted 300 tellings of the epic. Millions of Indians have read and ""watched"" the epic in a popular comic book and a hit TV series. I remember the soap nearly shutting down India on Sunday mornings in the mid-1980s - streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began. Hindu groups first protested against the inclusion of Dr Ramanujan's essay in the syllabus in 2008. At that time, the head of Delhi University's history department was also assaulted by some hot heads. But the teachers had stuck to their guns and refused to drop the essay. Three years later, bowing to renewed pressure, the university's top academic body decided to take the essay out of the history syllabus, though, reportedly, a minority of teachers protested against the decision. One of them, Abha Dev Habib, described the decision as ""very regressive and unfortunate"". So why have the right-wing groups railed against Dr Ramanujan's essay? Journalist Sugata Srinivasaraju suggests that the groups love the ""soap telling"" of the epic poem which iconises Ram and ""want the narrative to retain the structure and simplicity of a bedtime story so that you fall asleep in consent and total belief as you listen to it"". Literary critic Nilanjana S Ray writes in her blog that this may ""have been part of the general climate of intolerance and the battle over who had the right to tell the country's history and its myths that was part of the Indian landscape between the 1980s and the 2000s"". She talks about how self-appointed censors wilfully scan texts for ""offensive"" phrases. Ms Ray is correct. Last year Mumbai University withdrew Rohinton Mistry's novel Such a Long Journey - shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1991 - from its curriculum after the nationalist Shiv Sena staged protests against its ""derogatory"" references to party members. Mr Mistry said the move was ""a sorry spectacle of book-burning"". Last year the state of Gujarat banned Pulitzer Prize-winning author Joseph Lelyveld's incisive Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India long before it had been released in India. Gujarat's ruling Hindu nationalist politicians had been told that the book sensationalised Gandhi's friendship with a German man, who may have been homosexual. All this was far from true, but the ban stayed. 'Humiliated' And everybody remembers how India swiftly banned Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses in 1988 because some clerics said it had insulted Islam. The Indian-born Rushdie had said he was ""hurt and humiliated"" by the decision. The attacks on freedom of expression by the right-wing fringe extend beyond India. This July, a screening of Sita Sings the Blues, an award-winning take on the epic by American animator Nina Paley, in New York was cancelled after a local Hindu group bombarded the organisers with hundreds of protest emails. A man attending a lecture by American Indologist Wendy Doniger in London in 2003 threw an egg at her. He was apparently incensed ""by the sexual thrust of her paper on one of our most sacred epics"". Salil Tripathi, who has written a book on Hindu nationalist attacks on free expression, finds Hindu groups engaging in ""competitive intolerance"" after realising that other faiths are able to ""attract attention by challenging text, interpretations, films, books, music and imagery"". Many would agree with this. But the ease with which attacks on free expression can be mounted in a country which never tires of calling itself the world's largest democracy betrays a weak and inffectual state, which often fails to respect and protect dissenters. That, many believe, means mischievous, trouble-making minorities can easily subdue and attack dissent.","""How many Ramayanas ? Three hundred? Three thousand? At the end of some Ramayanas, a question is sometimes asked: How many Ramayanas have there been?"" wondered the late poet and scholar AK Ramanujan of the Indian epic in a compelling essay he wrote for a University of Pittsburgh conference in 1987."
"Hundreds of guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel were told to stay in their rooms as medical tests were carried out. The doctor is reportedly from the virus-hit Lombardy region. His wife has also now tested positive, sources say. Global cases of the virus have passed 80,000, the vast majority in China. Iran, one of the worst-affected nations outside China, on Tuesday said its deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, had tested positive for the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic - a situation where an infectious disease spreads easily between people in many countries. The proportion of infected people who die appears to be between 1% and 2%, although the WHO cautions that the precise mortality rate is not known yet. What's the latest from the hotel in Tenerife? Spanish media reports say that police are guarding the four-star hotel in the south-west of the island and making sure no one enters or leaves. But authorities are avoiding describing the situation as an enforced quarantine. Health authority spokeswoman Veronica Martin earlier said that guests were being monitored for ""health reasons"", adding that ""the degree of supervision will be assessed during the day, but so far, we're not talking about quarantine"". One guest posted on Facebook an image of a note put under the door of their room on Tuesday saying: ""We regret to inform you that for health reasons, the hotel has been closed down. Until the sanitary authorities warn, you must remain in your rooms."" Another guest, John Turton, told the BBC he and his wife had seen the note but then heard people walking outside and heading to breakfast. He said: ""The hotel has been cordoned off but we're trying to make the best of what's going on. We haven't been given any more information other than the note but we're going to just wait, try and enjoy the holiday and see what happens."" People had been walking around the hotel and using sun loungers, he said, but the police cordon was preventing people from leaving. Mr Turton said he had not yet been tested. Fellow Briton Nigel Scotland said he was most concerned that the man who had tested positive had been staying in the hotel for six days, and ""during that time, probably five or six hundred people must have left the hotel and gone back to various places in Europe"". The Italian doctor, who had been staying at the hotel with his wife, tested positive on Monday and has been placed in isolation at the University Hospital Nuestra Señora de Candelaria. He will undergo a second test to confirm the virus. His wife was taken to the same hospital where she also tested positive in the first analysis, Spain's Diario de Avisos reports. Meanwhile, a 36-year-old Italian woman has been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Barcelona. Spain previously had two confirmed cases, both tourists - one German and one British. What are the symptoms? The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. What should I do? Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. What does 'pandemic' mean?

"The post showed Scottish-born actress Louise Linton exiting a US military plane, and was tagged with the brand names of several fashion designers. It also featured a paragraph-long rant against one user who criticised her. ""I apologise for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response,"" she said late on Tuesday. ""It was inappropriate and highly insensitive,"" she said in a statement released to US media by her publicist. Her now-withdrawn Instagram post on Monday depicted her travels to Kentucky with her husband Steven Mnuchin, who is currently working to overhaul the US tax code. In what critics have suggested could be a government ethics violation, she tagged designers Hermes, Tom Ford and Valentino on to the image of her and her spouse exiting the blue plane with United States of America emblazoned on the fuselage. ""Glad we could pay for your little getaway,"" commented @jennimiller29, who is reportedly a mother-of-three from Portland, Oregon. ""Did you think this was a personal trip?!"" Linton wrote back, tagging the woman. ""Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?"" News outlets dubbed this Ms Linton's ""Let them eat cake moment"", a reference to a comment reputedly made by French queen Marie Antoinette upon hearing the citizens of Paris had no bread. A spokesman for the Department of Treasury told CNN: ""The Mnuchins are reimbursing the government for her travel, and she does not receive compensation for products she mentions."" This is not the first time Ms Linton has courted controversy. In July 2016, she published a memoir of her experiences volunteering in Zambia during her gap year, which provoked a huge online backlash as reviews and comments accused her of being patronising, inaccurate and misleading. Ms Linton and Mr Mnuchin were married two months ago at a black-tie event attended by President Donald Trump, his family, US cabinet officials and Wall Street executives. It featured Scottish bag-pipes, and the marriage ceremony was officiated by Vice-President Mike Pence. Mr Mnuchin made his fortune at Goldman Sachs before founding a Hollywood production company that has been behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise, Wonder Woman and American Sniper. The actress featured in 2016 horror films Cabin Fever and Intruder. She was briefly named interim chief executive of Dune Entertainment when Mr Mnuchin stepped down to become treasury secretary, the Hollywood Reporter writes. She is Mr Mnuchin's third wife, and he is her second husband.",The wife of the US treasury secretary has apologised for an Instagram post in which she boasted of her wealth and belittled a commenter.
"Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Joe Biden won the 3 November election. On Friday, he solidified his victory with a projected win in the state of Georgia - making him the first Democratic candidate to take the state since 1992. He now has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. However, Mr Trump has so far refused to concede. He has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and made unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud - but his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. What happened at the pro-Trump rally? Mr Trump's supporters kicked off the demonstrations at about noon local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday near Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House, and later headed towards the Supreme Court. As well as more mainstream Trump supporters, members of the far-right Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia group were among the marchers. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones addressed the crowd. Mr Trump's motorcade passed the gathering demonstrators on Saturday morning and did a circuit of nearby Freedom Plaza, but he carried on to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia without addressing the crowds. He later retweeted video of protesters, posted by White House official Dan Scavino, vowing ""We will WIN!"" While the daytime event was largely orderly, Trump supporters clashed with counter-demonstrators in the night. Video footage posted on social media showed fights breaking out. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. A growing sense of a fight losing its energy At the scene - Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC A gradual stream of pro-Trump supporters made its way towards Freedom Plaza, adorned with T-shirts and carrying placards which read ""Stop the Steal"" and ""Trump 2020"". The demonstrators were also identifiable by their lack of face-masks as many participants rejected measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. In that regard alone, this pro-Trump rally was seen by its critics as reckless and irresponsible. It took place with the United States grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths recorded in the country over the past 24 hours. None of that appeared to matter much to the participants who excitedly greeted President Trump's motorcade as it made an impromptu pass around the plaza. They are desperate to see this election result overturned and fully back his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and his refusal to concede. Still, although they may deny it, there is a growing sense of a fight losing its energy and that - like it or not - these supporters will see President-elect Joe Biden in the White House in January. What is Trump saying about the election result? The president continues to dispute the election result. In a slew of tweets on Saturday, he said checks on ballots in Georgia were a ""waste of time"", alleging problems with signatures but without giving evidence. A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but this is not expected to change the results there. On Friday, election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" However, Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the result suffered three setbacks on Friday: What's happening with the transition? Pressure is growing on Mr Trump to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access."" Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security. ""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"" he told Politico. A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings.",Thousands of supporters of US President Donald Trump turned out in Washington DC to back his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the election.
"By Alex Duval SmithBBC Africa, Freetown, Sierra Leone Dozens of volunteers like Jibrila Sesay are playing a central role in the gruesome clear-up operation after Monday morning's disaster. ""We have been collecting corpses and pieces of corpses and bringing them to the mortuary. It does not stop,"" says Mr Sesay in a break outside the Connaught Hospital mortuary. The volunteers are shuttled at high speed in police trucks and Red Cross vehicles to and from the devastated Regent area. The operation aims to prevent a health emergency - caused by rotting human remains on the hillside - from compounding the impact of the deadly landslide and floods. Inside the rundown city centre mortuary, chief pathologist Simeon Owis Koroma is writing his 350th death certificate since Monday. ""There will be more bodies, in smaller numbers in the coming weeks. That's how it is with disasters in Sierra Leone. But we cope. We are lucky because we are prepared,"" he says, paying tribute to the volunteers like Mr Sesay who were trained in safe burials during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Death certificates are completed once a body has been identified. At that point family members can choose to remove the body for a private funeral or, in most cases, given that survivors have lost everything, leave the burial to the government. Across the road from the mortuary, bereaved relatives stand lined up along the pavement under umbrellas. Many clutch photographs of loved-ones - curled or faded but priceless now. Sorrie Koroma's daughter was 12. She remains on his phone screen. ""I need to see my daughter's body just so my life can continue,"" he says. He believes his sister died along with her five children and his daughter, who was staying with them for the school holidays. Everyone here has lost several family members. They were asleep in their beds when the watery mud coursing down Sugar Loaf Mountain dislodged giant rocks. These in turn seem to have gathered incredible velocity and crashed through people's homes. Shacks were flattened, concrete houses suffered the same fate. During Wednesday, thanks to the tireless efforts of volunteers such as Mr Sesay, the mortuary became overfull. The stench of decomposing bodies pervaded Lightfoot Boston Street. A decision was taken to bag up body parts and all corpses damaged beyond possible identification. In a new volley of ambulance runs, Mr Sesay and his colleagues began transporting decomposing human remains to a mass grave designated for them at the Ebola cemetery at Waterloo. By now Mr Sesay seemed inured to his gruesome calling. He was just hungry. ""We have not been given a meal or a drink or even money for transport. At least during Ebola, international organisations took care of the volunteers,"" he says.","At least 600 people are still missing following a mudslide and flooding that devastated parts of Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown."
"Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said a strong request had been conveyed to the countries' ambassadors, where the group use ports and register their ships. Japan cut its annual Antarctic whale hunt short earlier citing ""harassment"" by the environmental activists. Commercial whaling was banned in 1986. Japan says its hunting is for science. Japan uses a regulation permitting hunting for scientific research. Iceland and Norway have lodged official objections to the ban and continue to hunt commercially. 'Obstructionist activities Japan stopped its whale hunt on Friday, saying ""harassment"" by the US-based Sea Shepherd activists had made it impossible to continue. The hunt had been halted temporarily last week, after Sea Shepherd boats blocked the stern of Japan's mother ship, preventing any harpooned whales from being loaded on. Sea Shepherd has been chasing the Japanese fleet for weeks in the icy seas of Antarctica. Japan's fisheries minister said the group's actions made it ""difficult to ensure the safety of the crew"". Japan's foreign minister said it was ""extremely regrettable"" that Sea Shepherd was not stopped. Mr Maehara said the foreign ministry had called in envoys from Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands to ""convey a sense of regret and reiterate a strong request to take effective measures to avoid the recurrence of Sea Shepherd's obstructionist activities"". The environmental group operates Dutch and Australian-registered ships. It also uses ports in Australia and New Zealand for its campaigns. Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson described Japan's decision to call off its hunt ""great news"" but said activists would tail the fleet until it was out of the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. ""Personally I don't trust them but I will take their word on this and we will follow them out. We're just not going to leave them until we know for sure they're out of the Southern Ocean,"" Mr Watson said. Japan's fleet involves 180 people on four ships, and is entitled to kill up to 945 whales in Antarctic waters during the southern winter season. Japan says the aim is to study their impact on fish stocks. Few Japanese eat whale regularly, but many object to what they see as unjustified foreign interference in a cultural tradition, the BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo reports. Anti-whaling nations, led by Australia and New Zealand, and environmental groups say the hunts are cruel and unnecessary. Australia is taking legal action in the International Court of Justice against Tokyo over whaling.","Japan has called on Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands to take ""effective measures"" against the anti-whaling group, Sea Shepherd."
"The governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, agreed to landfill work to develop a new base in a less densely populated part of the island, officials said. The agreement is a breakthrough following years of deadlock over where a new US base should be placed. The US has around 26,000 troops on Okinawa under a long-standing security alliance with Japan. However, the bases are unpopular locally and there is growing pressure from residents for the US military footprint to be reduced. The US Futenma airbase will now be relocated to a new site near Nago, a less densely populated area in the North of the island. The move comes after years of negotiations. In 1996, Japan and the US agreed to close the Futenma airbase. However, Okinawa's local government had been opposed to building a new base on the coast. Some critics have demanded that the US airbase move out of Okinawa prefecture completely and the decision has already prompted furious reactions. ""What the governor has done is unforgivable,'' Yuichi Higa, head of the assembly in Nago, where the new base is to be built, is quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. ""Residents who are opposed will surely resort to the use of force, such as blocking roads to stop this from happening,"" he adds. The decision is politically difficult for Mr Nakaima who was re-elected in 2010 opposing the relocation of the base on Okinawa. Mr Nakaima's decision came after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met him on Wednesday to urge him to agree to a new base. Mr Abe pledged an economic stimulus package to Okinawa every year until 2021. There has been a US military presence on Okinawa since the Americans invaded the island during World War II.","Japan has approved the relocation of a US military airbase on its southern island of Okinawa, officials said."
"It's early morning in a town near the Uzbek capital Tashkent and a large group of local teachers are queuing for a line of buses to take them to work. Among them is Elena Urlaeva, Uzbekistan's veteran rights activist and thorn in the side of the authorities. The teachers are not heading for schools and nurseries, but to nearby cotton fields, and Ms Urlaeva is trying to document the practice of forced labour in the cotton industry. The 58-year-old who heads the unregistered Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan is one of the few remaining independent rights defenders in a country tightly controlled by long-term authoritarian leader Islam Karimov. Ms Urlaeva is a regular observer of the cotton harvest, a vital cash crop, and on this morning she's chatting to teachers, trying to gather information about the mobilisation of government workers to do unpaid ""voluntary"" work. What happened next is based on her own account. The events cannot be verified, but are in keeping with what has happened to her and other activists in the past. Invasive search Ms Urlaeva says that when she started taking pictures, plain-clothed officers approached her and demanded her memory card. It's not in Ms Urlaeva's character to comply with officials easily. So she ran for it. She was caught and taken to the local police station where an officer accused her of destabilising the country and selling off state secrets. He hit her on the head. Such treatment was not new to Ms Urlaeva who has endured many similar encounters and whom international rights groups have called the ""bravest woman in Uzbekistan"". But what happened next was far worse. Doctors from a rapid psychiatric unit arrived at the request of the police and sedated her with three injections, she says. The body search that followed was described by the lobby group Human Rights Watch as a ""double cavity search"": Ms Urlaeva was held down by several people and the most intimate parts of her body were subjected to inspections. When that did not produce a result she was taken for an X-ray. The humiliation didn't stop there. Ms Urlaeva was refused permission to use the toilet and was told to go outside. ""We will film you,"" she says she was told. ""If you complain about what happened here we will put the footage of your bare backside all over the internet."" The brutality of the treatment Ms Urlaeva says she received has shocked her supporters. International rights groups from Amnesty International to Human Rights Watch reported her ordeal. The US and the European Union also expressed their concern. But the report doesn't come as a surprise. Persistence Ms Urlaeva has probably done more than anyone to observe, document and expose Uzbekistan's state-sponsored forced labour system, which has been condemned by international human rights groups and the International Labour Organization. ""The Uzbek government uses forced labour, including child labour to harvest a crop from which only the elite profit,"" Andrew Stroehlein from Human Rights Watch says. ""She was investigating this corrupt and abusive practice of forced labour."" Ms Urlaeva's persistent work contributed to an international campaign which ultimately led major global brands to join a boycott of Uzbek cotton. As a result, Uzbekistan began to eliminate at least the practice of child labour in the harvest with teachers, doctors and civil servants now making up the numbers. Elena Urlaeva's journey as a human rights activist began almost 20 years ago when she helped her brother who was caught up in a child custody case. It was the first time she fell foul of the authorities. She was charged with hooliganism and fired from her job with the state broadcasting company. Charges of hooliganism, detention and forced sectioning in psychiatric hospitals are well documented methods used by the authorities to silence and intimidate dissidents and activists - practices rolled over from the Soviet era. Ms Urlaeva has suffered all of them. She has been arrested, beaten, threatened - and was held in psychiatric institutions on many occasions amounting to many months of forced treatment and medication. She's campaigned on numerous issues, from opposing the destruction of homes for public building projects, to highlighting corruption, torture and false imprisonment. There seems to be almost no cause she won't pick up. This year she campaigned against the re-election of President Karimov. And on the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two she interviewed veterans to highlight poor living conditions. Her work, documenting abuses with photographs or first-hand interviews with relatives of victims, has been a rare source of information for human rights organisations as well as the media. In a country where public protests are unheard of, she has held numerous mini-demonstrations - often alone, holding a self-made placard. She's been whisked away many times - sometimes she's been stopped at her own front door. Her family has been put under pressure too. Ms Urlaeva's 11-year-old adopted son has suffered bullying at school and has been beaten up near his home by teenagers set up to ambush him. After every attack Ms Urlaeva has come back - although not always stronger. Her health has suffered, but not it seems her determination. In the latest correspondence following her ordeal Elena Urlaeva wrote that she was undergoing medical treatment for her injuries and looking for a lawyer to ""take on her abusers"". ""When I finish with the treatment I will continue my fight against modern day slavery,"" she wrote. In recent weeks she has since been arrested once more but is currently out of custody.","Elena Urlaeva was reportedly subjected to sexual violence by the Uzbek authorities, after years of arrests and beatings. The BBC profiles an activist renowned for her bravery."
"By Thom PooleBBC News As a rapper and producer, he has made some of the best-selling and most acclaimed music of our era. His marriage to a reality TV star has made him part of one of the most famous celebrity couples on the planet. He is a father and a successful fashion designer. He is not afraid of speaking out or courting controversy. He once accused President George W Bush live on air of racism and said the current incumbent has ""dragon energy"". He caused outrage by humiliating Taylor Swift on stage. Most recently he announced, not for the first time, that he is running for the US presidency. All of this and more have made him a figure of enormous public interest. Here's one important thing we don't know about Kanye West - the inner workings of his mind. That this remains unknown should be remembered in the light of a much discussed campaign launch and a follow-up series of tweets. The rally, and social media messages, have sparked alarm. Some people have mocked him. His behaviour has been called a ""meltdown"". So what to make of his latest actions? West's situation is complicated by the fact that he has been candid about his mental health. Last year, he stated he had bipolar disorder, describing being in a ""hyper-paranoid"" state and pleading for understanding. ""It's a health issue that has a strong stigma on it and people are allowed to say anything about it and discriminate in any way. This is like a sprained brain, like having a sprained ankle. And if someone has a sprained ankle, you're not going to push on him more,"" he said. On Wednesday, Kim Kardashian West publicly addressed the issue on Instagram. ""As many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand,"" she wrote. He is a ""brilliant but complicated person"" whose ""words sometimes do not align with his intentions"", she added. The condition, although varying in its symptoms and severity for individuals, can cause extreme mood swings, with patients suffering both depression and high-energy ""manic"" phases. Stick to what you know The overwhelming message from mental health experts is that, no one, not even professionals, should try to guess what an individual is going through, however famous they are. Speculation should be avoided, they say, not just for the good of a person in the public eye but for the wider understanding of mental health. ""You've got to think about all of the other people in the world who may be struggling with similar sorts of issues and think about what it means for those problems to be dragged up in the public eye,"" says Peter Kinderman, Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Liverpool. Prof Kinderman says unusual behaviour can be scrutinised but it is important not to link it to mental health conditions. ""If it were to be the case that a particular candidate for president was rambling and incoherent, say that he was rambling and incoherent. Give the evidence. If you think there is evidence that somebody is making bizarre and unsubstantiated claims, then say they are making bizarre and unsubstantiated claims. Whether or not somebody decides that that meets the criteria for a so-called mental illness of bipolar is another matter."" ""Stick to the facts, stick to what people do, and don't speculate to potential psychiatric causes of people's behaviour,"" he says. Be kind and constructive For counselling psychologist Dr Carolyne Keenan, a celebrity raising awareness about mental health and sparking a discussion can have a positive impact. But she says the condition needs to be separated from the figure. ""We have no idea who is in control of his social media accounts. So we take it at face value what's being put out into the world wide web are his words but actually, we don't know,"" she says. ""We have no idea what this man, the actual human man behind the celebrity face, is experiencing or going through."" ""I think everybody - members of the public, celebrities, need to remember that they don't know the full story. And so even making comment is really difficult because you don't know what you are commenting on."" ""Sensationalising these difficulties whether they are members of the public or celebrities is really problematic for anyone who is experiencing mental health because it gives a very small picture of what might be going on."" People should respond with ""curiosity and kindness"" if they feel they need to respond at all to West, she says. Or just don't say anything at all The idea of kindness might be anathema to the often brutal world of celebrity news and social media but despite the negative posts there has been a swell of concern and a wider discussion of the issues involved. Some commentators saw an element of hypocrisy amid the sympathy, pointing to the jokes faced by singers Azealia Banks and Britney Spears, who also faced public questions over their mental health. Others expressed concerns about attaching labels. One of the most shared responses came from singer Halsey, who called for understanding while admitting her own struggles with bipolar disorder.",A few things we know about Kanye West.
"Beltrán Leyva, 56, was one of four brothers who led the drug cartel of the same name which was known for its deadly rivalry with the Sinaloa cartel led by Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán. Héctor Beltrán Leyva, the last of the brothers to head the cartel, was arrested in October 2014. He had been posing as an art dealer. Family business Prison officials said they transferred Beltrán Leyva from his cell at a maximum security jail to a hospital in the nearby city of Toluca as soon as they noticed he was suffering from chest pains. He was facing charges of trafficking marijuana, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines. He took over the leadership of the Beltrán Leyva cartel after his brother Arturo was killed in a shootout with Mexican police in 2009. Two other brothers, Alfredo and Carlos, are in jail. The Beltrán Leyva brothers built up a powerful crime syndicate in the northern state of Sinaloa which later expanded into large parts of Mexico. Their cartel controlled many of the drug smuggling routes from Mexico into the United States. But they also expanded into extortion, racketeering and human trafficking. They built up a sophisticated intelligence network by infiltrating high levels of the security forces and even the government. Their cartel was engaged in a bloody turf war with the Sinaloa cartel and its leader, Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán. The brothers had once been allies with Guzmán and reportedly introduced the arguably most famous drug lord into the world of cocaine trafficking. But Guzmán and the Beltrán Leyva brothers split in 2008 and their battle for control of the state's drug routes escalated with the Beltrán Leyva seeking alliances with other cartels to defeat ""El Chapo"". Guzmán is currently on trial in New York under tight security as he escaped twice from high security jails in Mexico.","Mexican drug lord Héctor Beltrán Leyva has died of a heart attack in a hospital to which he was transferred from jail, government officials said."
"Gold, mining equipment and several aircraft used to take men and supplies into the remote region were seized. Police said the miners were causing grave environmental damage in the Yanomami indigenous reserve, near Brazil's border with Venezuela. The Yanomami have long complained of miners invading their lands. Five criminal groups involved in illegal gold mining were identified during a year-long investigation in Roraima state, the Federal Police said. The miners were using powerful pumps mounted on barges to dredge material from the bottom of the river and blast the river banks. The environmental impact was worsened by the use of highly-toxic mercury to separate gold from the river silt. Among those arrested are pilots, engineers and businessmen accused of funding the mining operations and selling the gold in the city of Boa Vista. ""The focus of the operation was to target the economic motor of illegal mining, which is to say the financiers and the planes used to invade indigenous lands,"" police superintendent Alexandre Silva Saraiva told O Globo newspaper. Around 20,000 Yanomami live in relative isolation in the indigenous reserve, which covers nearly 100,000 square km (38,610 square miles) of rainforest along the Venezuelan border. The tribe has been resisting encroachment by gold miners for decades, accusing them of destroying the rainforest and introducing diseases. In recent years the soaring price of gold on world markets has driven a surge in unlicensed gold-mining in many parts of the Amazon.","Brazilian police have carried out a big operation against illegal gold miners in the Amazon, arresting at least 26 people."
"The hashtag #JeSuisCharlie (I am Charlie) was trending as thousands posted messages honouring the victims. On 7 January 2015, militant Islamists shot dead 11 people in the magazine's Paris office, before murdering a policeman outside. It was the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France. On Tuesday, former French President François Hollande, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet were among those to pay their respects to the victims outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices in the capital. Several tributes took place, including readings of commemorative plaques, wreath-laying and a minute's silence. The weekly magazine, which published a special issue marking the anniversary with contributions from the victims' relatives, tweeted: ""It was five years ago, it was a century ago, it was yesterday. We do not forget and we will always continue: to speak, to write, to draw."" The message on the cover of the latest issue reads: ""New censorship... new dictatorship."" One of the images shared by many on Twitter was a mural by street artist Christian Guémy, which depicts the faces of the Charlie Hebdo editorial staff and others who were shot in the magazine's office five years ago. The French magazine's editor at the time, Stéphane Charbonnier, was among four cartoonists killed. Sketches and photos featuring Charbonnier, known as ""Charb"" - who was 47 when he died - were shared on social media. Philosopher Vincent Cespedes wondered what Charb would have made of the ""fiasco"" of the aftermath of the attacks. No lessons had been learned and divisions were deeper, he complained. Others shared images of support, showing crowds of people brandishing the French tricolour flag and banners reading: ""Je Suis Charlie"" Flowers were also placed outside a kosher grocery store in a suburb of the capital, which was targeted in the aftermath of the assault on Charlie Hebdo. A jihadist gunman killed three customers and an employee at the Hyper Cacher supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (Crif) has organised a separate ceremony for the victims of the Hyper Cacher supermarket, which is scheduled for Thursday evening. Three police officers were among the 17 victims of the gunmen on 7-9 January. In the days following the 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in unity marches across France, linking arms in an act of solidarity.

"Jon SopelNorth America editor@bbcjonsopelon Twitter Donald Trump now becomes the third member of the exclusive club that no one wants to be a member of. But the framers of the constitution with its impeachment provision could never have imagined the hyper partisanship - on both sides - that has been witnessed during today's sterile House proceedings. Each side with its own narrative, neither side listening to the other. And one can say with some certainty - I would bet all my yet to be gifted Christmas presents - that it will be much the same once this becomes a trial in the Senate in the New Year. Donald Trump will be acquitted. He won't be forced from office. So what changes? Well Donald Trump will have a place in the history books - and for a man with such a huge sense of self that will hurt. Acutely. But 2020? Far from this being a killer blow against Donald Trump, it might turbo charge his bid for a second term. The Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was always wary about going down the impeachment route. We'll discover next November whether that concern was well founded. Judging by what I saw in Michigan this week, Democrats will be acutely aware of the political risks. Want to find out more?",And so it is done.
"The closure - thought to affect 13 million students - will continue until the school year ends in late March. World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said the global outbreak had now reached a ""decisive point"" and had ""pandemic potential"". For the second day running, more cases have been reported outside than inside China. Dr Tedros urged governments to act swiftly and aggressively to contain the virus. ""This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,"" he said. What measures are countries taking? Globally, more than 80,000 people in more than 40 countries have been infected. Nearly 2,800 have died, the vast majority in China's Hubei province. Why is Japan closing schools? The closures are set to take effect on Monday and will last until the end of spring vacation - typically in early April. Mr Abe said the first weeks of March would be an ""extremely critical period"" for preventing virus transmission. ""The government attaches the top priority to the health and safety of children,"" he said. It follows China's decision not to reopen schools on the mainland after the Spring Festival holiday and instead ask nearly 200 million students to follow classes online from their homes. Hong Kong is also keeping schools closed until April. Many parents in Japan are concerned about what they will do with their children. ""My honest feeling - all schools on break? It's important to protect children, but what happens if they have working parents?"" one parent wrote on social media. Officials say child day care centres and after-school facilities can remain open. More than 200 people have so far been infected with the coronavirus in Japan. One woman in her forties in Osaka is said to have tested positive for a second time after earlier recovering. A tour guide who had come into contact with visitors from the Chinese city of Wuhan where the outbreak began, she first tested positive in late January and was discharged from hospital on 1 February, a statement said. Meanwhile, health officials in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong say some patients there who recovered and were discharged from hospital have again tested positive. The authorities in both countries say they will track former patients after they are discharged from hospital. Is it possible to be re-infected? By Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News There is still much that scientists don't know about this virus - and that includes the possibility of it infecting people more than once. Reports from China and Japan suggest that a small number of people recovered from the virus and then tested positive again within weeks. But there may be several reasons why that appears to be the case. Firstly, the virus may not have completely gone away before they were discharged and allowed home, and then may have got worse again. Secondly, although tests are used to determine if the virus is still present, they are not always accurate and may not be sensitive enough to detect dormant virus or very low-level symptoms. Anal swabs, which have been used, are not totally reliable at picking up the virus either. The fact is that more information on these specific cases is needed before scientists can come to any conclusions about whether the virus gives future immunity. If re-infection is possible, some experts say the virus could act like the flu or common cold and infect people on a seasonal basis. What is happening elsewhere? Iran has emerged as a major centre of coronavirus, with 26 deaths and nearly 250 confirmed cases. Several government officials are among those infected - including Vice-President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar, according to state media. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi and two MPs also have the virus. Ms Ebtekar's symptoms are reportedly not severe and she is not in hospital. The WHO's Michael Ryan said the extent of infection in Iran ""may be broader than we think"". But he said the country had a ""very high clinical capacity"" and the current 10% death rate for cases there probably reflected screening that was not picking up mild coronavirus cases. Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur called on Iranians to avoid ""unnecessary trips inside the country"". Kuwait and Bahrain recorded more cases on Thursday, all in people who had visited Iran, bringing their totals to 43 and 33 respectively. Lebanon has announced its third confirmed case, an Iranian citizen. South Korea saw new cases bringing its total infections to 1,261 with 12 deaths. Singapore said a 12-year-old student at the top Raffles Institution school was among three new cases, bringing its total to 96. In Europe, Italy had 453 infections and 12 deaths. Denmark recorded its first case in a man back from a ski holiday in Italy and Estonia saw its first case in someone returning from Iran. The US has recorded its first confirmed case on US soil, the 60th in the country overall. The unidentified person in California had ""no relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient"" with the virus, officials said. And Latin America recorded its first case in Brazil, in a person who had returned home from Italy. Have you been affected by the spread of coronavirus?

"Slovenia was the first former Yugoslav republic to join the European Union, in May 2004 - shortly after joining Nato. Unlike Croatia or Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia was swiftly won with relatively few deaths. The country also found the transition from a state economy to the free market easier than most. Long regarded as one of the best-performing new EU members, Slovenia was dragged into a deep recession by the European financial crisis in 2012. This prompted mass protests at corruption and economic mismanagement by successive governments.

He narrowly won re-election in November 2017, beating Marjan Sarec of the new LMS party. The role of president is largely ceremonial, but carries authority in defence and foreign affairs. Prime minister: Janez Jansa Elections in June 2018 saw major gains for the SDS anti-immigration party of veteran former prime minister Janez Jansa, but he was blocked from returning to office by a minority centre-left coalition. This fell apart in February 2020, when Prime Minister Marjan Sarec resigned in a failed bid to call early elections, allowing Mr Jansa to form a centre-right coalition that following month - in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak. He has pledged to build border fences to keep out migrants and boost benefits for families with children, in common with his populist neighbour Viktor Orban in Hungary. Janez Jansa has moved from the centre to the right in a long political career that was nearly derailed by a two-year jail sentence for corruption in 2013, before the Constitutional Court dismissed his conviction on appeal. MEDIA Slovenia's media scene is diverse and free. The main papers are privately-owned. The broadcasting sector is a mix of public and private ownership. Many households are connected to cable, satellite, or internet protocol TV (IPTV). There is an advanced digital terrestrial TV (DTT) network. By the end of 2015 almost 73% of the population was online. TIMELINE Some key dates in Slovenia's history: 1918 - After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Slovenia joins the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The kingdom later becomes known as Yugoslavia. 1941 - Slovenia is occupied by Nazi Germany and Italy during the Second World War. 1945 - At the end of the war, Slovenia becomes a constituent republic of communist Yugoslavia. 1991 - Slovenia, along with Croatia, declares its independence. The Yugoslav army intervenes and about dozens of people are killed before the European Union brokers a ceasefire. The Yugoslav army withdraws. 2004 - Slovenia joins the European Union. 2011-13 - Mass protests at corruption and financial mismanagement during the European sovereign debt crisis.","Slovenia is a small country in Central Europe, but contains within its borders Alpine mountains, thick forests, historic cities, and a short Adriatic coastline."
"The tax, similar to VAT in the UK or GST in Jersey, at a maximum level of 5% would have been explored under the proposals debated by the States. Politicians rejected the move by a vote of 28-18. A total of 17 changes to the report are due to be discussed before it is voted on. The decision not to pursue GST will only be confirmed if the whole report is approved. Just 13% of 248 responses to a public consultation, carried out as part of the overhaul, supported the introduction of such a tax. The review was launched because of the island's ageing population - an estimate from 2012 suggested the number of over-65s would double in 20 years. The proposals include raising the pension age to 70, changing personal tax allowance levels, means testing universal benefits, stopping free prescriptions for those aged over 64 and ending free TV licences for those aged over 74.","Plans to include a goods and services tax (GST) as part of an overhaul of Guernsey's tax, pensions and benefits system have been thrown out."
"Tensions between both countries are mounting over trade hostilities and China's increasingly assertive claims to territory in the South China Sea. Mr Mattis is the first Pentagon chief to visit China since 2014. He is on a trip across Asia, meeting several regional US allies. Mr Mattis said his talks with Mr Xi and other officials in Beijing on Wednesday had been ""very, very"" good, adding that the US was assigning a ""high degree of importance to the military relationship"" with China. Mr Xi added that China had peaceful intentions, but reasserted his view that there would be no concessions from China about what it considers to be Chinese territory. ""We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors,"" Mr Xi said, according to Chinese state media. ""What is other people's we do not want at all."" The US has repeatedly criticised China's movements in the South China Sea, accusing it of intimidating its neighbours and militarising the area, by building up facilities on artificial islands. Several countries have competing claims in the disputed sea, but China claims the largest portion of territory, saying its rights go back centuries. The area is a major shipping route, and a rich fishing ground, and is thought to have abundant oil and gas reserves. The defence secretary's Asia tour comes after a historic summit in Singapore which saw US President Donald Trump meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. On Thursday, Mr Mattis travelled on to South Korea and met the country's defence minister Song Young-moo. Mr Mattis sought to reassure Seoul that the US's commitment to the region's security remained ""ironclad"". He said Mr Trump's recent decision to suspend military drills with South Korea would create ""increased opportunity for our diplomats to negotiate, increasing prospects for a peaceful solution on the peninsula"". President Trump's move to cancel the joint military exercises, following his meeting with Mr Kim, was seen as a big concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. North Korea sees the annual exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, but the government in Seoul maintains they are defensive in nature.","China is committed to peace but will not give up ""even one inch"" of territory, President Xi Jinping has said, after talks with visiting US Defence Secretary James Mattis."
"So when rival brand Milka challenged its German monopoly on square chocolate, the battle lines were drawn. Milka achieved an initial victory in 2016 by getting the trademark deleted but that ruling was overturned. Finally, the case ended up in the Federal Court of Justice, where judges have now thrown out Milka's complaint and ruled in favour of Ritter Sport. First, the history The square bar dates back to 1932, when Clara Ritter came up with the idea, according to company legend. ""Let's make a chocolate bar that fits in everyone's jacket pocket without breaking and weighs the same as a normal long bar,"" she is supposed to have said (although in German). By 1970 it had come up with the slogan ""Quadratisch, praktisch, gut"" - quality, chocolate, squared, as the company likes to translate it. The family company registered the shape with the German patent and trademark office in 1993, so when Milka began marketing a square bar in 2010, the case went to court. Milka, now owned by Mondelez, won round one in the federal patent court but that ruling was later thrown out and the patent court decided the following year that Ritter could keep its three-dimensional monopoly. Milka's final challenge in the Federal Court of Justice has now also failed. What the judges said Normally a brand cannot claim protection in Germany if its shape gives the product ""an essential value"". But the judges in this case said Ritter Sport was different. Consumers considered the square nature of the chocolate bar as an indication of both where the chocolate came from and its quality, they concluded. They said there was no artistic value to the shape and it did not lead to differences in price. Their ruling means that the incumbent bar can remain the only top-brand square chocolate bar on the shelves in German shops.","For decades, Ritter Sport has marketed its chocolate bars on their unique, square shape."
"The foreign minister said the situation was ""unsustainable"". The Wikileaks founder has been confined to the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012, claiming political asylum. He was originally wanted on sexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped, but says he now fears extradition to the US. ""We're considering and exploring the possibility of a mediation,"" Ecuador's foreign minister, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said on Tuesday, adding that they could involve a ""third country or personality"". ""A person cannot live in those conditions for ever,"" she said. Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, made headlines in 2010 when his organisation leaked US military helicopter footage, which showed the killing of civilians in Iraq. London's Metropolitan Police says he will still be arrested if he leaves the embassy building, on the charge of failing to surrender to the court back in 2012 - and the UK refuses to guarantee he will not be extradited to the US. Ms Espinosa said: ""No solution will be achieved without international cooperation and the cooperation of the United Kingdom, which has also shown interest in seeking a way out."" In 2016, a United Nations panel ruled that Mr Assange was being ""arbitrarily detained"" and should be allowed to walk free. It said he should also be compensated for his ""deprivation of liberty"". The UK Foreign Office, however, rejected the ruling. Mr Assange's legal team have maintained his confinement to the embassy amounts to illegal detention. Responding to Ms Espinosa's comments, a UK Government spokesman said: ""The Government of Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice."" The sexual assault allegations against Mr Assange were dropped in May 2017. At the time, Ecuador said the UK should guarantee him ""safe passage"" to Ecuador if he leaves the embassy.",Ecuador says it is considering inviting a third-party mediator to tackle its long-standing disagreement with Britain over the fate of Julian Assange.
"The study aims to enrol 5,400 sexually active young men and women. About seven million people in South Africa are living with the virus, which is one reason why the trial is taking place there. Experts hope the vaccine will be ""the final nail in the coffin"" for HIV. The vaccine regime being tested is based on one used in a trial in Thailand in 2009, which had a protection rate of about 30%. Results from South Africa are expected in four years. Since the HIV virus was identified in 1983, efforts to develop an effective vaccine have proved unsuccessful. Researchers hope that this might come to an end with the current study, which is code-named HVTN 702. It is being led by South Africa's Glenda Gray, a university research professor and head of South Africa's Medical Research Council. ""It will tell us whether the initial success observed [at a smaller scale] will bear fruit in the form of a safe and effective HIV vaccine designed for the people of southern Africa,"" Dr Gray said. According to the United Nations, more than 30 million people have died from Aids since the 1980s. Recent breakthroughs in anti-retroviral treatments have improved the lifespan of Aids patients. However, in countries where such treatments may not be available, the only effective prevention remains abstinence or the use of barrier methods such as condoms during sexual intercourse. 'Making history' As part of the present trial, study participants will receive a total of five injections over one year, says the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is sponsoring the trial. Awethu Benenengu, a 20-year-old construction worker, who is one of the participants in the trial, told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Johannesburg that he volunteered because he wanted to help defeat Aids. ""I decided to get involved because I don't like the way my HIV-positive cousin is treated,"" Mr Benenengu said. ""There is so much stigma. I want to be part of a generation that changes this and I want my children to be proud one day of their father for getting involved in making history."" Participants who become infected with HIV during the trial will be referred to local medical providers for care and treatment, NIH adds. They will be advised on how to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus.","A new vaccine against HIV, the virus that causes Aids, is being tested in South Africa in what scientists say is the first large study of an HIV vaccine's effectiveness since 2009."
"Khaled al-Asaad had been held for about a month by the group, which seized the Unesco World Heritage site in May. The 81-year-old's family informed Syria's director of antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim that he had been beheaded. Mr Karim said IS militants had tried to extract information from Mr Asaad about where some treasures were hidden. He described Mr Asaad as ""one of the most important pioneers in Syrian archaeology in the 20th Century"". The murder has been denounced as a ""horrific act"" by Unesco, the UN cultural organisation. ""They killed him because he would not betray his deep commitment to Palmyra,"" Unesco Director General Irina Bokova said in a statement. ""His work will live on far beyond the reach of these extremists,"" she said. ""They murdered a great man, but they will never silence history."" IS has demolished several ancient sites in Iraq, and there are fears that it will destroy Palmyra, one of the archaeological jewels of the Middle East. 'Stores of gold' The Syrian state news agency, Sana, and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Mr Asaad had been beheaded on Tuesday at a square outside the museum in the modern town next to the ruins, also known as Tadmur, in front of dozens of people. Photos apparently showing Mr Asaad's body tied to what appears to be a lamp-post adjoining a main road have been circulated online by IS supporters. His severed head was placed underneath it. A sign attached to the body accused him of being an apostate who was in regular communication with and supported the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He was also accused of representing Syria at overseas conferences with ""infidels"", in addition to being director of Palmyra's ""idols"". The summary killing was one of several that have been carried out by IS in and around Palmyra since they took the city in May. Mr Asaad spent most of his life working to promote and protect Palmyra. He was in charge of the site for four decades until 2003, when he retired. He then worked as an expert with the antiquities and museums department. Khaled al-Asaad Profile of Syria's 'Mr Palmyra' IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Your memories of Palmyra Saving history from the jihadists Syrian ruins that influenced the West Jihadists in Palmyra were looking for ""stores of gold"" in the city, Mr Karim said, [but] ""I deny wholeheartedly that these stores exist"". Mr Karim described Mr Asaad as ""a scholar"", while denouncing the presence of IS in Palmyra as ""a curse and a bad omen"" on the city and ""every column and every archaeological piece in it"". Abdalrazzaq Moaz, co-director of cultural heritage initiatives at the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), told the BBC that Mr Asaad had devoted his entire life to the site and died trying to protect it. Since overrunning Palmyra, IS has destroyed a second century statue of a lion and two nearby Islamic shrines, which it described as ""manifestations of polytheism"". The group also released a video in July showing some 20 captured government soldiers being shot dead at Palmyra's theatre. Syrian government forces have sought to drive IS out of the Palmyra area in recent months and there has been fierce fighting in nearby towns. Also on Wednesday, new images were posted online appearing to show IS ""religious police"" vandalising ancient artefacts in the northern Iraqi province of Nineveh. Unesco's statement said that Mr Asaad's death was part of two intense blows within a week that had been endured by Syria's cultural heritage community. It said that Qasem Abdullah Yehiya, a senior member of the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums, was also reported to have been killed in a rocket attack on the Citadel of Damascus last week.",The archaeologist who looked after ancient ruins of Palmyra in Syria for 40 years is reported to have been killed by Islamic State (IS) militants.
"By James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, wrote in his seminal study Diplomacy that ""Beijing's diplomacy was so subtle and indirect that it largely went over our heads in Washington"". Governments in the West employed sinologists to interpret the opaque signals emanating from China's politburo. Under its former leader, Deng Xiaoping, the country's declared strategy was to ""hide its ability and bide its time"". Well, not any more. China has dispatched an increasingly vocal cadre of diplomats out into the world of social media to take on all comers with, at times, an eye-blinking frankness. Their aim is to defend China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and challenge those who question Beijing's version of events. So they launch salvos of persistent tweets and posts from their embassies around the world. And they hold little back, deploying sarcasm and aggression in equal measure. Such is the novelty of their techniques that they have been dubbed ""wolf warrior"" diplomats after the eponymous action films. Wolf Warrior and Wolf Warrior 2 are hugely popular movies in which elite Chinese special forces take on American-led mercenaries and other ne'er-do-wells. They are violent and extremely nationalistic in tone. One critic dubbed them ""Rambo with Chinese characteristics"". A promotional poster showed a picture of the central character raising his middle finger with the slogan: ""Anyone who offends China, no matter how remote, must be exterminated."" In a recent editorial, the Chinese Communist Party newspaper, Global Times, declared the people were ""no longer satisfied with a flaccid diplomatic tone"" and said the West feels challenged by China's new ""Wolf Warrior"" diplomacy. A new kind of language Perhaps the quintessential ""wolf warrior"" is Lijian Zhao, China's young foreign affairs spokesman. He is the official who made the unsubstantiated suggestion that the United States might have brought coronavirus to Wuhan. He has more than 600,000 followers on Twitter and he exploits that audience almost by the hour, relentlessly tweeting, retweeting and liking anything that promotes and defends China. This is of course what diplomats anywhere in the world must do: it is their job to promote their country's national interest. But few diplomats use language that is, well, so undiplomatic. Take the Chinese embassy in India which described calls for China to pay compensation for spreading the virus as ""ridiculous and eyeball-catching nonsense"". China's ambassador in the Netherlands accused President Donald Trump of being ""full of racism"". In response to Mr Trump's much mocked speculation about the best ways of tackling the virus, the chief spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing tweeted: ""Mr President is right. Some people do need to be injected with #disinfectant, or at least gargle with it. That way they won't spread the virus, lies and hatred when talking."" In London, China's ""wolf warrior"" is Ma Hui, number 3 at the embassy. His Twitter username includes the words ""warhors"" and he is as prolific as he is robust. He tweeted: ""Some US leaders have stooped so low to lie, misinform, blame, stigmatise. That is very despicable, but we should not lower our standard, race to the bottom. They don't care a lot about morality, integrity but we do. We can also fight back [against] their stupidity."" Now much of this may look like the familiar knockabout you get on social media. But for China, it is a huge departure. Research by the German Marshall Fund think-tank suggests there has been a 300% increase in official Chinese state Twitter accounts over the last year, with a fourfold increase in posts. Kristine Berzina, a senior fellow at the GMF, said: ""This is very unusual from what we have come to expect from China. ""In the past, China's public face has been to show a positive image of the country. There has been an encouragement of friendship. Cute panda videos would be much more common than harsh take-downs of various government policies. So this is a really big departure."" And it is clearly a policy choice by China's authorities. They could have chosen to focus their information campaign entirely on what has been dubbed their ""mask diplomacy"", namely the donation and sale of protective medical kit around the world. This promoted China's soft power as other countries struggled to cope. But such goodwill as was generated by this ""health silk road"" appears to have been dissipated by the aggression of the ""wolf warriors"". Angry ambassadors China's ambassador in Australia, Cheng Jingye, has been engaged in a furious row with his hosts. When the government backed an independent international investigation into the origins of the virus, Mr Cheng hinted China might boycott Australian goods. ""Maybe also the ordinary people will say, 'Why should we drink Australian wine or eat Australian beef?'"" he told the Australian Financial Review. Ministers accused him of threatening ""economic coercion"". Officials at the Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade called the ambassador to ask him to explain himself. He responded by publishing an account of the conversation on the embassy website, in which he urged Australia to stop playing ""political games"". China this week imposed import bans on some Australian beef processors and threatened tariffs on Australian barley. In Paris, China's ambassador Lu Shaye was summoned by the foreign ministry to explain comments on his embassy website suggesting that France had abandoned its elderly to die of Covid-19 in care homes. The pushback against Chinese diplomats has perhaps been strongest in Africa where a number of ambassadors - from Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana and the African Union - were summoned by their hosts in recent weeks to explain racist and discriminatory treatment of Africans in China. The Speaker of Nigeria's House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, published footage of him remonstrating with China's ambassador. In an article for Foreign Affairs magazine, Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister, argues that China is paying a price for its new strategy: ""Whatever China's new generation of 'wolf-warrior' diplomats may report back to Beijing, the reality is that China's standing has taken a huge hit (the irony is that these wolf-warriors are adding to this damage, not ameliorating it). ""Anti-Chinese reaction over the spread of the virus, often racially charged, has been seen in countries as disparate as India, Indonesia, and Iran. Chinese soft power runs the risk of being shredded."" The risk is that China's diplomatic assertiveness may harden attitudes further in the West, with countries becoming more distrustful and less willing to engage with Beijing. In the United States, China has already become an issue in the presidential election, with both candidates competing to be tougher than the other. In the UK, Conservative MPs are organising to impose greater scrutiny on Chinese policy. The question is whether these diplomatic tensions will deepen into a more serious confrontation between China and the West. This matters not just because of the general risks of escalation but also because there is much on which the world needs to co-operate. In the short term, the research, testing, development and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine will require international co-operation including China. In the longer term, most analysts expect some kind of global collective action to repair the world economy. But the chances of that are looking slim. Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said: ""If the US and China did not set aside their differences in order to work together to fight a global pandemic, it is hard to believe they are going to find a way to work together to bolster their economies."" Some strategists argue that while the West will have to increase its strategic independence from China after the pandemic, it will also have to find a new framework for co-operation. China's ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy may not be making that any easier.",Once upon a time Chinese statecraft was discreet and enigmatic.
"He was voted in as the country's prime minister in 2018, but in February 2020, found himself ousted in a twist of events that saw the collapse of the governing coalition. Mahathir had previously served as the country's prime minister from 1981 to 2003. But in 2018, he came out of retirement in a bid to take down former prime minister Najib Razak - who has been accused of embezzling hundreds of millions in state funds. Mr Mahathir, together with former coalition leader Anwar Ibrahim, successfully took down Mr Najib. But the alliance showed that it could not withstand the weight of internal rivalries. Mr Mahathir's resignation triggered the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan coalition, paving the way for a new prime minister. As quickly as it begun, Mr Mahathir was removed from the post, replaced by a former party member of his - Muhyiddin Yassin. Mr Mahathir has described the appointment of Mr Muhyiddin as illegal and a betrayal. But the saga is still far from over - and it's clear Mr Mahathir will not go down without a fight. Humble beginnings Mr Mahathir joined political party United Malays National Organisation at the age of 21 and ran a medical practice for seven years in his home state of Kedah before becoming a member of parliament in 1964. In 1969 he lost his seat and was expelled from the party after writing an open letter attacking the then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. He later wrote a controversial book entitled The Malay Dilemma. In it, he argued that the country's Malay population had been marginalised, but also castigated them for apathetically accepting a second-class status. It struck a chord with younger UMNO leaders and he was invited back into the party, re-elected to parliament in 1974, and appointed minister of education. Within four years he had become UMNO's deputy leader and, in 1981, he became prime minister. Under his rule, Malaysia transformed into one of the Asian economic tigers of the 1990s - prestige projects such as the Petronas Twin Towers demonstrated the extent of his ambitions. His authoritarian but pragmatic policies won him popular support at home, though this was tempered by his scant regard for human rights. Black eye for democracy Opposition politicians were jailed without trial under a much-criticised Internal Security Act. Most infamously, his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was sacked, accused of corruption and sodomy and later jailed on the latter charge, when he called for economic and political reforms in 1998. Frequent barbed comments about the West also earned Mr Mahathir a reputation abroad. Days before he resigned in October 2003, for example, he angered several foreign governments and Jewish groups by claiming a Jewish cabal ""ruled the world"". He said he left his post ""disappointed... because I have achieved too little in my principal task of making my race a successful race, a race that is respected"". Bitter medicine Even in retirement, he never really left the political arena. He publicly criticised his successor Abdullah Badawi and, after lacklustre election results for the ruling coalition in 2008, quit the party in what many saw as a way to pressure Mr Abdullah to go. That paved the way for Mr Najib to come to power. Mr Mahathir's initial support for Mr Najib changed, however, as accusations of corruption against him surfaced in regard to a heavily indebted state investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). He commanded enough loyalty from supporters within UMNO to press the case against Mr Najib from within the party and government. When they got nowhere, however, he, and several high-profile supporters quit UMNO and crossed over to the opposition in 2016. In January 2018, he announced his intention to contest the election, at the age of 92. On 9 May, he won a historic victory, ousting his former allies after more than 60 years in power. He, together with Mr Anwar and several other parties, formed the Pakatan Harapan coalition, which ruled the country for two years before it collapsed. Mr Mahathir threw the country's politics into turmoil in late February 2020 when he resigned, breaking his alliance with Mr Anwar. But after his resignation, he and Mr Anwar later announced that they had, in fact, reunited again and commanded majority support. But the king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, who had ultimate say on who should form a government, chose Mr Muhyiddin. A former interior minister, Mr Muhyiddin once controversially described himself as ""Malay first"" and Malaysian second.

"Opposition parties have accused the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of destroying lives. Four million people were excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) list, which was published on Monday. NRC head Prateek Hajela told the BBC that those left out ""are people from different religions and groups"". The NRC is a list of people who can prove that they arrived in Assam prior to 24 March 1971, before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence. The exercise, in a state with a history of communal violence, has stirred controversy. Mr Hajela, who was appointed by the Supreme Court to handle the NRC, told BBC Urdu's Shakeel Akhtar that the process ""is about a specific date and has got nothing to do with religion, caste or race"". But the opposition Congress party and some human rights groups have described it as an attempt to strip four million people, many of them Muslims, of their citizenship. Critics have also alleged that the BJP government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to publish the list for political purposes ahead of the general election next year. However the Indian government has maintained the process is needed to root out illegal Bangladeshi migrants. Home minister Rajnath Singh told the upper house of parliament that it was ""fair and transparent"" and that ""no Indian citizen would be left out"". Many Bengalis - a linguistic minority in Assam - are also worried they will be deported en masse. But Mr Hajela said the list was not final and those excluded can appeal as well as submit ""fresh documents"" to claim citizenship in the coming months.","Indian officials leading a charge to identify illegal migrants in the north-eastern state of Assam have said that the process ""is not targeting Muslims""."
"The far-right former army captain, for years a marginal figure, has insulted women and homosexuals. He has praised the country's former dictatorship and attacked political correctness. His comments deeply divided voters and, while some expressed a dislike for him, others felt he was the outsider needed to tackle rampant crime and rough up the establishment. This desire for change helped propel him to a big victory in his country's presidential election in October, in which he won 55.2% of the vote to see him take office on 1 January 2019. 'Excessive ambition' The 63-year-old graduated from the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Rio de Janerio in 1977 and served as a paratrooper. An assessment conducted during his years in the military reportedly said he showed ""signs of excessive ambition to be financially and economically successful"". But his military career did not pass without controversy. In 1986, while still an army captain, he was arrested after signing an article complaining about low salaries received by the military. When he was first elected to Congress four years later he continued to defend the interests of the armed forces, which were his main electoral base at the time. Few imagined at that time that he could become a serious contender but his outspoken rhetoric has appealed to many who blame the left for Brazil's problems. Mr Bolsonaro has portrayed himself as the defender of a Brazil of decades past, suggesting that the country should return to the hardline tactics of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship. He has praised this era, in which thousands of people were imprisoned and tortured, as a ""glorious period"". ""I am in favour of torture - you know that,"" he said during a television appearance in 1999. ""And the people are in favour of it, too."" Law and order During his seven terms in Congress, in which he largely remained a fringe political figure, his priorities evolved beyond the military. He has focused on the broader issues of public safety and law and order, which made him popular with many voters in crime-wracked Brazil. In 2017, he controversially said that ""a policeman who doesn't kill isn't a policeman"". On the campaign trail he reinforced his position as a hardliner who aimed to restore safety to the streets. ""Safety is our priority! It is urgent!"" he wrote on Twitter. ""People need jobs, they want education, but it's no use if they continue to be robbed on the way to their jobs; it's no use if drug trafficking remains at the doors of schools."" On this issue, he has pledged to reduce crime and increase security by relaxing the country's gun laws. Just days before taking office, he tweeted about plans to ensure that any citizen without a criminal record would be permitted to possess a firearm, and said he would work to ""fight the Marxist trash"" he claimed was being taught in schools. 'Trump of the Tropics' Some media have nicknamed him the ""Trump of the Tropics"", comparing his anti-establishment populist style and social media presence to that of the US leader. Mr Bolsonaro campaigned as a nationalist and among the comparisons with the US president include his promise to move Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem as he looks to strengthen ties with the country. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in Brasilia for Mr Bolsonaro's inauguration, said just hours ahead of the ceremony that Brazil's president-elect had told him that the move was a matter of ""when, not if"". A provocative figure One of the candidates who ran against him in the first round of the presidential elections, Ciro Gomes, went as far as dubbing Mr Bolsonaro a ""little tropical wannabe Hitler"". His statements on issues ranging from abortion to race, and from migration to homosexuality, have proved provocative and garnered much attention. ""I'd prefer [to see] a son of mine to die in an accident than [to be] a homosexual,"" he told Playboy in a 2011 interview. In 2016, he provoked outrage by remarking that a fellow lawmaker was not worth raping because he thought she was ""very ugly"" and not his ""type"". He has also described having a female child as a ""weakness"", and said that he would not employ women equally because ""[they] get more labour rights than men"". Mr Bolsonaro has dismissed the criticism of these comments as ""political correctness"". ""Political correctness is a thing of leftist radicals,"" he said in an interview with daily newspaper Correio Braziliense. ""I am one of the most attacked persons."" New supporters On 6 September 2018, Mr Bolsonaro was stabbed at a campaign rally in the south-east state of Minas Gerais. He had already been doing well in the opinion polls but the intense media attention which followed was new even for him. Even though he was confined to a hospital bed following the attack, unable to return to the campaign trail, he kept rising in the polls and continued to attract new supporters. Many in the business sector liked his strong backing of free-market economics. Some young people were attracted to his plain speaking and his social media presence. Evangelicals, who account for one in every four voters, liked his conservative outlook. All of these groups will now be hoping he can deliver on his campaign promises and lead Brazil in a new direction. Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.",Jair Bolsonaro was courting controversy long before he launched his successful bid for Brazil's presidency.
"Mr Dodik, who has close links with Russia, has urged Bosnian Serbs to secede, saying Bosnia has failed. The main Bosnian Muslim party, the SDA, said its candidate Sefik Dzaferovic would be the Muslim representative. Croat voters returned centrist Social Democrat Zelijko Komsic to their presidential seat. Turnout for Sunday's vote was 53%, election commission president Branko Petric told reporters. If officially confirmed, Mr Dodik will take turns as head of state with the two other winners. The three-member collective presidency - Croat, Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) and Serb - was established as part of the US-brokered 1995 Dayton peace deal that ended the war in which 100,000 people died. The country is still split into two entities - the Serb Republic (Republika Srpska) and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Why is Dodik so divisive? Mr Dodik, who has led Republika Srpska since 2006, defeated the incumbent Bosnian Serb member of the three-member presidency, centre-right politician Mladen Ivanic. ""My first priority will be the position of the Serb people and of the Republika Srpska,"" he said, claiming victory in the northern town of Banja Luka. ""I believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina also may progress if everyone is respected."" Even aside from his calls for secession from the Bosnian state, Mr Dodik is a divisive figure on the national scene. He was a key supporter of a controversial referendum to make ""Republika Srpska Day"" a holiday on 9 January - marking the founding of the state in 1992, which was one of the triggers for the bloody war that followed. He has consistently challenged national institutions in favour of those in Republika Srpska. How complex was the vote? The run-up to the election was marred by ethnic abuse and intimidation, observers say, more than 20 years after Bosnia was torn apart by civil war. Under Bosnia's complex political system, voters had to elect a total of five presidents and 14 prime ministers. Candidates stood for the central government - two chambers of parliament and the tripartite presidency - plus governments for the two separate entities. In Republika Srpska voters had to elect MPs, a president and two vice-presidents. In the Muslim-Croat Federation a bicameral parliament had to be elected that included a president and two vice-presidents. In addition, voters cast ballots for assemblies that run the federation's 10 cantons. In all, nearly 7,500 candidates stood for 518 offices across the country. The parliamentary results will be announced later on Monday. Election monitors complained that campaigning was marred by ethnic leaders using divisive rhetoric harking back to the war. Little progress Analysis by Guy De Launey, BBC News, Belgrade One in five people are unemployed and almost half the country's young people can't find a job. Those who are in work earn an average of around €400 (£350; $460) a month. Many people have lost hope that the country can offer them a future. Almost 200,000 have left to work abroad in the past five years - 5% of the population. But Bosnia's politics remain firmly based on ethnic leaders using fear to divide, rule and profit and this election will be no different. The EU announced a grand plan for reforms three years ago, but there's been little progress. Whatever the results, it's not clear that a new government could actually be formed. The Constitutional Court invalidated parts of the electoral law two years ago, and parliament has failed to revise it.","Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik has won his community's seat on Bosnia-Herzegovina's three-person presidency, election officials say."
"Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton denies he acted improperly in halting the deportation of Alexandra Deuwel. The decision helped a wealthy family, and followed a plea by their relative - a prominent sporting chief executive. Local media said Mr Dutton had overruled a senior official's advice. Critics have compared the case to Mr Dutton's unwavering commitment, as immigration minister, to keeping asylum seekers in overseas detention - a long-time controversial policy. Mr Dutton failed in two attempts to become prime minister last week, ultimately losing out to Scott Morrison. What is the au pair controversy? Ms Deuwel, 27, had her tourist visa cancelled on arrival in Australia in 2015, on suspicions that she had intended to work. However, Mr Dutton used his ministerial discretion to reverse the decision. Ms Deuwel had previously worked for pastoralists Callum and Skye MacLachlan in South Australia. Their relative, Australian Football League boss Gillon McLachlan (who uses an alternative spelling), had lobbied Mr Dutton to intervene in Ms Deuwel's case. Adding to public scrutiny, Callum MacLachlan's father, Hugh, has donated about A$150,000 (£84,000; $110,000) to the governing Liberal Party since 1999, local media reported. Mr Dutton's decision to grant a visa to at least one other au pair is already the subject of a Senate inquiry. What has Mr Dutton said? On Thursday, the minister strongly rejected any suggestion that the MacLachlan family had influenced his decision. He said he had assessed Ms Deuwel's case on its merits, telling radio 2GB that she had no criminal history and had agreed not to work in Australia. ""I thought it was an application of common sense,"" he said. Mr Dutton has not responded to reports that an Australian Border Force official warned him in 2015 that some evidence ""does not support the Minister intervening"". Why has it caused such interest? Aside from scrutiny of the case specifically, observers have pointed out that it has only become public now - days after Mr Dutton's failed leadership bids. ""It suggests that somebody behind the scenes is trying to do as much damage as they possibly can to Peter Dutton in circumstances where he's obviously been in the headlines,"" ABC political correspondent Laura Tingle said on Tuesday. But it has also ignited allegations of double-standards on visa issues: among those angered are supporters of a Tamil family involved in a high-profile effort to stay in Australia. The family, who have lived for years in Queensland, are now facing deportation - despite a petition to Mr Dutton that gathered almost 120,000 signatures. Others have made similar comparisons about Australia's policy of sending asylum seekers who arrive by boat to Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The policy has been criticised by human rights groups as inhumane. Recently, it has been reported that child asylum seekers in particular have been struggling acutely with mental illness. Australia argues its offshore detention policy is necessary to disrupt human trafficking and save lives at sea.","An Australian minister is facing growing questions over why he personally intervened to grant a visa to a French au pair, in a case that has attracted national attention."

"The OPCW has yet to release the details of the declaration, leaving the size of Syria's arsenal subject to speculation. But experts believe the stockpile, considered to be one of the world's largest, contains the blister agent sulphur mustard, the nerve agent sarin, and the more potent and persistent nerve agent VX. Following a deadly chemical weapons attack in Damascus on 21 August 2013, the United States and Russia agreed a plan with Syria to remove and destroy its chemical weapons by mid-2014. Weapon development and delivery The US stated in 2002 that Syria had a ""long-standing chemical warfare programme"", which was first developed in the 1970s. A recent report from the US Congressional Research Service said Syria probably began stockpiling chemical weapons in 1972 or 1973, when it was given a small number of chemicals and delivery systems by Egypt before the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Damascus started acquiring the materials and knowledge necessary to produce chemical weapons in the 1980s, reportedly with the help of the Soviet Union. Equipment and chemicals are also thought to have been procured from European companies. In 2011, the US director of national intelligence concluded that Syria remained ""dependent on foreign sources for key elements"" of its chemical weapons programme, including precursor chemicals, which are generally dual-use chemicals that can be combined to produce blister or nerve agents. Before the uprising, the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre (CERS) was believed to run at least four chemical agent manufacturing plants - at Dumayr, Khan Abou, Shamat and Furklus - and operate additional storage sites dispersed across the country in some 50 different towns and cities. The exact size of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal is not known, but in June 2012, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Deputy Chief of Staff Maj Gen Yair Nave described it as ""the largest in the world"". According to a French intelligence assessment published in September 2013, Damascus has more than 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents and precursor chemicals, including: According to the White House, the Syrian military has access to ""thousands of munitions"" that can be used to deliver chemical warfare agents, including a variety of long- and short-range ballistic missiles, aerial bombs and artillery rockets. Since the beginning of the uprising, ammunitions carrying lesser volumes are believed to have been developed for more focused and local tactical use. Regarding the chain of command, the French intelligence assessment said the section of the Syrian military responsible for filling munitions with chemical agents and for security at storage sites - ""Branch 450"" of the CERS - was staffed only by members of the president's minority Alawite sect and was ""distinguished by a high level of loyalty to the regime"". ""Bashar al-Assad and certain influential members of his clan are the only ones permitted to give the order for the use of chemical weapons. The order is then transmitted to those responsible at the competent branches of the CERS,"" it added. ""At the same time, the army chiefs of staff receive the order and decide on targets, the weapons and the toxic agents."" Sulphur mustard Syria is widely believed to possess large quantities of the blister agent sulphur mustard. The term ""mustard gas"" is commonly used to describe the agent, but it is liquid at ambient temperature. Sulphur mustard sometimes smells - like garlic, onions, or mustard - and sometimes has no odour. It can be clear to yellow or brown. People can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact or breathing if it is released into the air as a vapour, or by consuming it or getting it on their skin if it is in liquid or solid form. It causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. Though exposure to sulphur mustard usually is not fatal, there is no treatment or antidote to mustard which means the agent must be removed entirely from the body. Syria started to produce tube and rocket artillery rounds filled with mustard-type blistering agents in 1993, presumed to be the first weaponisation of its kind. Sarin Sarin is a neurotoxic organophosphorus compound that is highly toxic and lethal. It is considered 20 times as deadly as cyanide and is impossible to detect because it is a clear, colourless and tasteless liquid that has no odour in its purest form. It can also evaporate and spread through the air. As with all nerve agents, Sarin inhibits the action of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which deactivates signals that cause human nerve cells to fire. This blockage pushes nerves into a continual ""on"" state. The heart and other muscles - including those involved in breathing - spasm. Sufficient exposure can lead to death via asphyxiation within minutes. Sarin, like VX, is believed to be stocked in a ""binary manner"" by the Syrian military. This means it is kept as two distinct chemical precursors, which are combined just before use, either manually or automatically inside a weapon when launched. According to a report by UN chemical weapons inspectors, there is ""clear and convincing evidence"" that surface-to-surface rockets containing sarin were fired at suburbs to the east and west of Damascus in an attack on 21 August that killed hundreds of people. According to US, British, French and Israeli officials, there is also evidence that Syrian government forces used sarin against rebels and civilians on several previous occasions. French intelligence said analysis of samples taken from the northern town of Saraqeb and the Damascus suburb of Jobar in April showed that munitions containing sarin had been deployed. However, doubts have been expressed about the chain of custody of those samples as they travelled from their original locations in Syria to laboratories in other countries. VX VX, another neurotoxic organophosphorus compound, is the most toxic known chemical warfare agent - about 10 times more toxic than sarin. It is an oily liquid that is amber in colour, and is odourless and tasteless. Once it is released into the air, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact or inhalation. Symptoms appear within a few seconds after exposure to the vapour form of VX, and within a few minutes after exposure to the liquid form. As with sarin, VX attacks the nervous system. VX evaporates about as slowly as motor oil and can persist for a long time under average weather conditions, unlike sarin. It therefore poses both a short- and long-term threat.","Last September, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) received an initial disclosure from the Syrian government of its chemical weapons programme, the first time the country had made a formal declaration. Syria also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and agreed to the destruction of its chemical weapons."
"About 150 people had gathered near the interior ministry, demanding the release of political prisoners. It follows Tuesday's ""day of rage"" when hundreds calling for democracy protested in Damascus and Aleppo. The interior ministry said ""infiltrators"" tried to stir chaos. But among those held was a 10-year-old boy. Activists say he was with his father - and both were detained. Others included 69-year-old Damascus university philosophy professor and author Tayeb Tizini, and leading human rights activist Suhair Atassi. ""They pulled Suhair by her hair and took her away,"" one demonstrator said, according to Reuters. Journalist and activist Mazen Darwish told the BBC that he was set free only after being held for five hours in the military security branch's detention centre alongside 20 others, including women. A further 15 were still being detained by state security, he said. ""When I showed them my international press card they shouted and said 'Why were you standing among protesters and not among the journalists?',"" said Mr Darwish, head of the Syrian Centre for Freedom of Speech. No further information about those detained was immediately available. No dissent The ruling Baath party has dominated Syrian politics for nearly 50 years. President Bashar al-Assad - who came to power in 2000 after three decades of rule by his father Hafez - has moved slowly to open up the economy, but his administration does not tolerate any dissent. Some of the 150 protesters who gathered held photos of those they said had been imprisoned for their political views. ""After a long wait and rumours of an impending release of prisoners of conscience in Syria, our hopes have vanished,"" said a statement from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The organisation - which groups together the families of 21 jailed human rights activists - had said it planned to demonstrate in front of the ministry on Wednesday. Reports said that shortly after the protesters gathered a counter-demonstration was held in the same square with people chanting that they would defend the Syrian president ""with our soul, with our blood"". The interior ministry denied that the initial protest was political in nature. ""There were some persons who took advantage of this call to slip among these people and tried to shout some slogans,"" said Gen Mohamed Hassan al-Ali, of the interior ministry's moral guidance department. There are thousands of political prisoners in Syrian jails, and major opposition groups are banned. The government also blocks access to several internet sites and maintains strict control of the media though authorities have lifted bans on Facebook and YouTube in the wake of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. In January, President Assad told the Wall Street Journal that Syria was more stable than Tunisia and Egypt. He said that there was no chance of political upheaval, and pledged to press on with a package of reforms. The BBC's Lina Sinjab, in Damascus, said that many had doubted that any protests would take place in Syria, but observers here believe events over the past couple of days have broken the silence that dominated the country.","At least 35 people have been arrested after they defied a ban on demonstrations and protested in the Syrian capital, reports say."
"The Nazi swastika, and the words KKK and white power were inscribed across the wall and several headstones at the Fingal Head cemetery, a burial ground for Aboriginal people in the north of New South Wales state. The desecration is thought to have happened early Tuesday, reports say. Police are investigating the incident. 'Traumatic' New South Wales Aboriginal Affairs Minister Victor Dominello expressed outrage over the incident: ""Any racist attack on a site that is the designated final resting place for people of any culture or heritage is disgusting and sickening."" Burial sites are deeply sacred places in Aboriginal culture and even saying a dead person's name is taboo because it is considered disrespectful, correspondents say. A local indigenous man said the act of vandalism at the cemetery, which was used by Aborigines between 1864 and 1964, was distressing. ""There was a photograph which they smashed and left lying there, so that's pretty traumatic for the family,"" Kevin Slab told reporters. Local Mayor Barry Longland said the attack took the community by surprise. ""There is a very close-knit community there with a strong indigenous representation.""","The desecration of an Aboriginal burial site in eastern Australia has been condemned as ""disgusting and sickening"" by Australian officials."
"A statement on a government website said PM Nguyen Tan Dung had ordered police to investigate and take action against those responsible. He has also ordered civil servants not to read the blogs, which he said, had ""agitated against... the state"". Media in Vietnam is state-owned and operates under strict regulations. Three blogs - including the popular Dan Lam Bao (People Doing Journalism) and Quan Lam Bao (Officials Doing Journalism) - were named in the government statement. ""This is a wicked plot of the hostile forces,'' the statement said, adding that the blogs had ""slandered the country's leadership, fabricated and distorted information, agitated against the party and the state, and caused suspicion and mistrust in society"". 'Secret world' Two of the blogs said they would keep publishing, with one saying its bloggers were prepared to be jailed. The government, which does not allow freedom of expression, has been under pressure from a number of blogs and bloggers over corruption cases or human rights issues. ""Dan Lam Bao and its companions are prepared to be repressed and imprisoned rather than leading the life of a dumb dog that dares not to bark, subservient to those who abuse their power,"" one of the blogs being targeted said in response to the statement. Quan Lam Bao began publishing only in May but quickly became one of the most popular blogs in Vietnam. It mostly publishes unverified sensational news about the power struggle at the top of the leadership and details of personal lives of Communist Party leaders, says the BBC's Nga Pham. In an atmosphere lacking information and transparency, it offers a glimpse - albeit unsourced in many cases - into the secret world of these leaders, our correspondent says. The blog also clearly targets the prime minister and this may be the reason why he is targeting the blog, she adds. Human Rights Watch has accused the Vietnamese government of jailing dozens of bloggers and peaceful activists. In July, the mother of a prominent blogger died after setting herself on fire to protest against the detention of her daughter, Ta Phong Tan, who is among a group of bloggers facing charges of anti-state propaganda.","Vietnam's prime minister has hit out at three blogs critical of the government, ordering that those behind them be ''seriously punished''."
"Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, known as Ahok, is a Christian and was Jakarta's first non-Muslim governor in 50 years. But he was convicted of blasphemy in 2017 in a case seen as a test of religious tolerance in the Muslim-majority country. His case sparked protests in support and condemnation of a politician once tipped for the presidency. Mr Purnama was released early - for good behaviour - on Thursday morning after serving 20 months of a two-year sentence. He was greeted by supporters who had gathered outside the detention centre in the hope of meeting him. ""My heart told me I had to be here,"" supporter Heni told the BBC. ""I am overjoyed that he is free. I feel like a weight has been lifted from all of us."" Singing songs, some people broke down in tears on hearing the news that he was free. The politician's eldest son posted a photo of himself with his father on Instagram with the message: ""He is back! My dad is free! Thanks everyone for the support."" Blasphemy accusations Ahok was accused of blasphemy over comments he made during a pre-election campaign in September 2016. In a speech, he implied that Islamic leaders were trying to trick voters by using a verse in the Koran to argue that Muslims should not vote for a non-Muslim leader. An edited video of his remarks was widely shared online. It sparked outrage among religious hard-liners who staged regular large rallies calling for him to face trial. ""His prosecution will not be forgotten"" Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia correspondent In his last public letter from jail, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama made it clear he wanted to start a new chapter in his life. He asked his supporters to now call him by his initials BTP instead of Ahok. He said he was grateful to God for the time he spent in jail and that if he had stayed in power he would have been ""more arrogant, ruder"" and hurt more people. There is now talk of him going on an international speaking tour, creating a YouTube channel and getting married. But his prosecution will not be forgotten. It changed Indonesia and has had lasting political and social impacts. It sent a clear message that freedoms of expression and religion in Indonesia are tenuous. And has made it harder for non-Muslims to rise to positions of power in this multi-faith county. Throughout the trial, Mr Purnama denied wrongdoing, but did apologise for his comments. The eventual verdict had been met with strong protest. Hard-line Islamic groups who called for the maximum penalty of five years said it was too lenient, but Mr Purnama's supporters said it was too harsh and that he should be acquitted. Anti-corruption stance During his term as Jakarta governor from 2014 to 2017, Mr Purnama was known as a straight-talking technocrat. His policies included the setting of minimum wages, calling for free school education and healthcare, reducing traffic congestion and tackling corruption among government officials. These policies, along with his strong anti-corruption stance, made him very popular in Indonesia and he was tipped as a possible future president. But in May 2017 he lost the governorship to conservative Muslim candidate Anies Rasyid Baswedan. Mr Purnama's subsequent imprisonment deeply divided the nation. ""This ruling is sending a clear message to the minorities that they can't play around with the majority or this is what will happen to you,"" Bivitri Susanti, one of the founders of the Centre of Study for Law and Policy, told the BBC at the time. Jakarta is a melting pot of many ethnic groups. Despite being a majority Muslim country, Indonesia has a pluralist and multi-faith constitution that recognises six official religions.","The former governor of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, has been released early from his jail term for blasphemy."
"The ruling, officially announced on Thursday, overturns a 1994 rule barring women from small ground-combat units. But the military will have until 2016 to argue for any specific posts they think should remain closed to women. President Barack Obama welcomed the ""historic step"". At a Pentagon press conference, Mr Panetta said: ""Female service members have faced the reality of combat, proving their willingness to fight and, yes, to die to defend their fellow Americans."" 'Valour knows no gender' He acknowledged a complaint frequently voiced by women denied combat roles - that military careers are hindered by a lack of combat experience. ""I fundamentally believe that our military is more effective when success is based solely on ability and qualifications and on performance,"" said Mr Panetta. Military chiefs will be asked to report back to Mr Panetta by 15 May on their initial plans to implement the new policy. A senior defence official said about 237,000 jobs would be newly open to women ""who can meet the standards"". President Barack Obama said: ""This milestone reflects the courageous and patriotic service of women through more than two centuries of American history and the indispensable role of women in today's military. ""Many have made the ultimate sacrifice, including more than 150 women who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan - patriots whose sacrifices show that valour knows no gender."" Mr Panetta hopes to have the process complete by 2016. The US is likely to have withdrawn all combat troops from Afghanistan well ahead of that time. Some jobs are expected to be opened to women this year, while others - including for special forces such as the Navy Seals and the Delta Force - could take longer. One of the most high-profile female combat veterans in America is US Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who lost her legs when the Army helicopter she was piloting in Iraq was shot down. On Thursday, she quipped on NBC's Today show: ""I didn't lose my legs in a bar fight. I'm pretty sure I was in combat."" Restrictions were first eased a year ago, when the Pentagon opened up 14,500 roles, closer to the frontline, which had previously been off limits to female personnel. In November, a group of four women in the military sued the defence department over the ban, arguing that it was unconstitutional. One of the plaintiffs, Marine Corps Capt Zoe Bedell, said existing rules had blocked her advancement in the Marines. During the Iraq and Afghan wars, US female military personnel have worked as medics, military police and intelligence officers, sometimes attached but not formally assigned to frontline units. As of 2012, more than 800 women were wounded in those wars, and more than 150 have died. Women comprise 14% of America's 1.4 million active military personnel.","US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has lifted the military's ban on women serving in combat roles, potentially opening hundreds of thousands of frontline positions to women."
"Paulina Vega had come under pressure to quit after her country's condemnation of the pageant owner, Donald Trump. Mr Trump caused a furore last month after he said Mexican immigrants who came to the US brought drugs and crime. Ms Vega called Mr Trump's comments ""unjust and hurtful"", but said she would continue as Miss Universe. ""The fact that I am not giving up my crown doesn't mean I am changing my stance about everything I said,"" Ms Vega told local radio on Monday, adding that the Miss Universe organisation did meaningful social work. ""I have kept doing my job as Miss Universe all these days. The work continues as always despite all this craziness going on,"" she added. Boycott Mr Trump had attacked Ms Vega for keeping her crown, saying: ""Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticised me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crown - hypocrite."" While announcing his candidacy for the US presidency last month, Mr Trump had accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States. He also pledged to build a ""great wall"" on the US border with Mexico and insisted it would be paid for by Mexicans. He later insisted he was criticising US lawmakers, not Mexican people. Following Mr Trump's remarks, several TV networks across the Americas said they would no longer air Miss Universe, including the Spanish language network, Univision and NBC. Mexico also announced that it would not send a contestant to the pageant.","The reigning Miss Universe says she will not give up her crown, despite her home country Colombia withdrawing its bid to host the competition."
"Deputy Al Brouard's motion calls for the right to live in Guernsey to lapse if people move away from the island for a period longer than they lived there. This would not affect anyone born in Guernsey or who moves to the island as a child and subsequently gains residency qualification. Changes to how the population is controlled go to the States next week. Currently there are 13 different ways a person can become a qualified resident. Deputy Brouard said: ""I don't think it is fair that people can work in Guernsey then 40 years later they can come back to retire despite only spending 15 years in the island and, say, 30 years somewhere else. ""It is just putting a marker down to say... once you leave the island you would have to come back within the amount of time you spent here originally.

His motion is among 11 proposed amendments to the population plan, which consists of 45 recommendations including replacing the island's current right to work permit and housing licences.","People who move away from Guernsey may not be allowed to retire to the island, if a States proposal is approved."
"Members of France's main opposition party voted to support the rebranding on Friday, with 83% of members approving the move. The move has sparked widespread debate in France, with critics arguing that all French people are Republicans. Mr Sarkozy is widely expected to try for the presidency again in 2017. According to one opinion poll, almost 70% of the public - and 40% of UMP supporters - said that no political party had the right to use the Republican label. In an editorial in Le Monde (in French), a group of three writers and politicians said: ""For Nicolas Sarkozy to name his party in such a way that claims to represent all Republicans, as though there is no-one else apart from him, is insulting and irresponsible."" Left-wing sympathisers had challenged the plan in court, arguing that - thanks to the French Revolution - every citizen of France is a Republican, not just those who vote for Mr Sarkozy, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris reports. However, the court rejected their call for a ban. Mr Sarkozy says that the rebranding was a ""rallying call to all who are distressed to see the Republic decline day after day and who want to stop this decline"". The former French president is expected to try for the presidency again in 2017, having lost to Francois Hollande in 2012.",Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has changed his party's name from Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) to The Republicans.
"By Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna Asylum seekers will be forced to hand over their mobiles so the authorities can check their identities and where they have come from, the cabinet has agreed. If an applicant is found to have previously entered another EU country where the ""Dublin regulation"" is in force, they could be sent back there. Under the Dublin rule, people typically have to seek asylum in the first EU state they reach. In 2015, at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, over 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria, more than 1% of the country's population. Initially the refugees were welcomed, but the mood in the country quickly changed. Support for the far-right, anti-immigrant Freedom Party - then in opposition - grew, and Austria's centre-right conservative People's Party, led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also campaigned strongly against migration. These days, since measures were introduced to try to close off the Balkan route, the number of migrants reaching Austria has dropped significantly. In the first three months of this year, 3,992 people claimed asylum in Austria, compared with 14,400 in the same period in 2016. But the government is continuing with its hard line. It wants to end what Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, of the Freedom Party, calls ""abuse"" of the asylum system. The bill does not just target mobile phones. It will also allow the authorities to seize up to €840 ($1,037; £730) in cash. The money will be used to pay for the upkeep of migrants as they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. Austria is not alone. Denmark, Germany and Switzerland have also permitted the confiscation of valuables belonging to refugees to pay for their stay. In Denmark, some reports suggest the authorities have not received large amounts of money from the policy. ""We have very deliberately set ourselves the goal of fighting against illegal migration but also against the misuse of asylum,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said at a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting. 'Disproportionate interference' The bill, which must now be passed by parliament, would also force hospitals to tell the government when asylum seekers will be discharged, to ensure effective deportations. And the measures mean that refugees will only be able to apply for Austrian citizenship after 10 years, as opposed to six years which is currently the case. Deportations of asylum applicants convicted of crimes will also be speeded up. Opposition parties and human rights groups have condemned the plans. Amnesty International said the plans to seize phones was ""a completely disproportionate interference in people's private affairs"", and that displaced people were being lumped together as cheats or a security risk. It said the only thing the bill achieved was to create more ""uncertainty and mistrust among the population"". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","Austria's government surged to power late last year with a promise to stop illegal migration and crack down on refugees, and its latest move is to target their phones."
"The move follows allegations of corruption within President Edgar Lungu's administration. The UK takes a ""zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption"", the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) said in a statement. Ireland, Finland and Sweden have also suspended aid. More than 50% of Zambia's 17 million people live below the poverty line, the World Bank says. The aid freeze by the UK is believed to affect the education, health and nutrition sectors, as well as social cash transfers for the poorest Zambians. An inquiry ordered by Zambia's president had uncovered the ""misappropriation"" of $4.3m, his spokesman Amos Chanda told BBC Focus on Africa. The money had gone missing from the Social Cash Transfer programme, which allocates money that is paid directly to the poorest, Mr Chanda confirmed. The government was committed to taking action but was still awaiting the final results of its four-month audit, Mr Chanda said. ""The president wants answers within a week,"" he added. 'Expensive vehicles bought with diverted money' DfID said it had put direct financial support to the Zambian government on hold while investigations continued. ""There is no evidence that confirms any loss of UK taxpayers' money,"" it added. A statement from the Swedish government's aid agency, Sida, said there had been ""strong suspicions of irregularities"". The corruption has also affected Zambia's health and education ministries, the UK-based journal, Africa Confidential, reports. It says that a report by Zambia's auditor general highlighted that people in the ministry of education established shell companies to divert funds. Money from the Social Cash Transfer programme was used to buy expensive vehicles, Africa Confidential adds. The UK government has not confirmed the amount of aid that has been affected. The aid suspension comes as Zambia's debt levels face increasing scrutiny. The International Monetary Fund said it has suspended lending to the country as it is worried that its debt is unsustainable.","The UK has frozen aid funding to Zambia, after its government admitted that $4.3m (£3.3m) meant for poor families had gone missing."
"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter Not only has he tweeted what would normally be a highly classified, military-quality satellite image showing the devastation around the launch pad at Iran's main space centre following a significant explosion. He has gone further by apparently taunting the Iranians, insisting the US was not involved in the ""catastrophic accident"" but also wishing Iran ""good luck"" in finding out what happened. Was this presidential sarcasm or misinformation? Was he implying that somebody else might indeed have been involved? Or was it just the president's regular habit of responding by saying the first thing that came into his head? It's hard to say. But, as ever, Mr Trump's intervention raises more questions than it answers. For some weeks now experts have been reporting preparations for an Iranian space launch. Commercial satellite imagery of the space centre showed the launch pad being made ready. The mission, according to Iranian reports, was to put a small telecommunications satellite - Nahid 1 - into orbit. Two previous launch attempts at the start of this year had ended in failure. This one, too, appears now to have ended in disaster. The difference, though, is that the full magnitude of the calamity has been revealed by President Trump himself. So what caused Iran's rocket to explode so dramatically on the launchpad? We simply do not know. But there are two obvious answers. Firstly it could have been down to a simple technical malfunction; a problem with fuel or some kind of error in the rocket's manufacture - a faulty weld seam or whatever. These things happen; think back to some of the disasters during America's own space programme. Even the most technologically advanced nations have setbacks. But Iran's track record with launches is very poor. A New York Times article back in February, drawing heavily on interviews with unnamed US officials, suggested that Iran's two earlier failures this year were part of a pattern. It suggested that some 67% of Iran's orbital launch attempts over the past 11 years had failed. It described this as ""an astonishingly high number"" compared to the average 5% failure rate for comparable launches worldwide."" The article indicated that the Trump administration was moving to reactivate a sabotage programme against Iran's missile efforts by introducing faulty parts into the supply chain and so on. A previous US effort had been phased out by President Obama. So could sabotage be implicated in this latest accident? Who knows, but Mr Trump himself has only muddied the waters by his Twitter intervention. There is a significant history of external forces attempting to hamper Iran's military research. Israel and the US were involved in efforts to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment programme using a computer virus. Iranian scientists and technicians have been assassinated. And of course both the US and Israel see Iran's space programme as inextricably linked to its wider missile efforts. However, the most extraordinary aspect of this affair is the president's publication of a normally classified high-resolution satellite image that could only have come from a military source. This has thrown the missile and arms control community on the Twitter-sphere into a frenzy. It is an amazing thing for a US president to do, giving all Washington's enemies a very public insight into its extraordinary intelligence-gathering capabilities.",President Donald Trump has set a new standard for extraordinary presidential behaviour.
"Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter@awzurcheron Twitter On immigration, deregulation, taxes and cultural flashpoints, the president offered policies - and claimed victories for accomplishments - that have won him the praise of his base and stirred the ire of his political opponents. Last year in his address to Congress, Trump laid out an ambitious agenda, but aside from tax reform, many of his big-ticket legislative directives were either derailed in Congress or languished without ever becoming concrete proposals. On Tuesday night it was time to reform the battalion and head, once more, unto the breach. Here are some key takeaways - as well as an early judgement on how they might fare in the battles to come. A change of tone, but… Eleven months ago, the newly inaugurated president gave a speech to Congress that was warmly received, even by some Trump critics on the left. Mr Trump at one point pledged to put ""trivial fights behind us"". It hasn't exactly turned out that way. Now the president is again preaching national unity. The question is whether a divided American public - nearly half of whom ""strongly disapprove"" of the president - can still be converted. Claims of a ""new American moment"" and lines like ""for the last year we have sought to restore bonds of trust between our citizens and our government"" may fall on deaf ears among all but the president's loyal followers. In particular Democrats may have tuned out because that ""trust"" line came immediately after talk about honouring the flag and standing for the national anthem - not-so-veiled references to the president's sharp attacks on NFL player protests. The president has a list of accomplishments of which he can - and does - boast, but they were largely moves to please his base. His task, which will take more than one night, is to convince more of the public that his accomplishments are in their interest. There's a reason Mr Trump touted the US economy right at the top of his speech. He hopes Americans, many of whom view the nation as on the wrong track, will change their minds when they look at their bank accounts in the months to come. Outlook: Just a few days after his last congressional speech, Mr Trump tweeted about his suspicions that Barack Obama had his ""wires tapped"" during the campaign. The ""kinder, gentler"" Trump was gone in a flash. How long can this one last? Immigration 'open hand' Democrats want protections for undocumented migrants who entered the US as children. The president wants sweeping changes to rules governing legal immigration and billions of dollars for border security, including his border wall. Mr Trump promised in his address on Tuesday to extend an ""open hand"" to Democrats. Several weeks ago he said that any comprehensive agreement needed to be a ""bill of love"". In between those two lines, however, was a government shutdown and considerable acrimony. The president has belittled his Democratic opponents and accused them of endorsing open borders and increased crime. And that ""open hand"" quote, which was released to the press before the speech, looked considerably different when it turned out to be surrounded by extended passages about immigrant crime, gangs and a not-so-veiled swipe that ""Americans are dreamers too"". Perhaps this is all just part of his negotiating style, to be shrugged off when a deal is near. But with Democrats worried that their base won't allow them to back down from a fight, a promise of co-operation probably won't be enough. Outlook: An open hand can be a gesture of kindness or the prelude to a slap. The chasm between the two sides is just as wide as it was yesterday. In fact, it may be wider. Catch me up 'Infrastructure week' revisited It has become a running joke in Washington circles to exclaim something like ""infrastructure week is off to a great start"" any time an administration-friendly news cycle is upended by a Trump-created conflagration. A White House focus on an infrastructure investment programme has been frequently promised and oft-delayed. Now it's back as a topic of conversation - this time, with an anti-regulation twist. The president received cross-party cheers for calling for big spending - $1.5tn - but Democrats sat on their hands when told it could come from subsidised private investment. He also held out the hope that building projects would be easier to accomplish by cutting red tape. ""We built the Empire State Building in just one year,"" Mr Trump said. ""Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?"" There were other areas of possible bipartisan compromise - on lowering prescription drug prices, job training, prison reform and family leave legislation - but they were only mentioned in passing. Infrastructure, it seemed, was where the president is most likely to make an extended effort. Outlook: Spending money on bridges and roads is popular. It creates local jobs and makes constituents happy. Democrats like it. Republicans like it. The president likes it. While deregulation may be a sticking point, this is a deal waiting to get done.","Donald Trump took a measured tone. His speech was garnished in flowery, high-minded language. But beneath it all was the same hard edge."
"The States said Nelson Place in Smith Street, St Peter Port, is now under offer with a 12-month option. This reserves the building for the prospective buyer, Ossory Estates Limited, for a year while redevelopment negotiations take place. The building was put up for sale as part of Guernsey States efforts to rid itself of assets it no longer needs. Sympathetic development Large retail units are mostly expected to occupy the redeveloped site. The Nelson Place building has historic importance in the town and the preservation of architectural features, particularly the frontage, will have to be addressed in a sympathetic manner, officials have said. Ossory spokesman Brett Allen said meaningful discussions can now take place regarding the redevelopment with both the Environment Department and potential retail occupiers. ""We shall be working hard to achieve a result for the benefit of the States and to diversify the retail opportunities on offer in the town,"" he said. The estimated sale price of the building in 2008 was about £3m.",The old post office building in Guernsey could finally be sold - two years after it was put on the market.
"Jérôme Hamon had his first transplanted face removed last year after signs of rejection following a treatment with an incompatible antibiotic during a cold. The 43 year old remained in a hospital in Paris without a face for two months while a compatible donor was sought. He said: ""The first [face] I accepted immediately. This time it's the same."" Mr Hamon suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic condition that caused severe disfiguring tumours on his face. His first transplant, in 2010, was a success, but he caught a common cold in 2015 and was given antibiotics. The drug was incompatible with the immunosuppressive treatment he was having to prevent a rejection of the transplanted material. The first signs of rejection came in 2016 and last November, the face, suffering from necrosis, had to be removed. Mr Hamon lived without a face in a room at Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris without being able to see, speak or hear until January, when a face donor was found and the second transplant carried out. To avoid further rejection, Mr Hamon - dubbed ""the man with three faces"" by French media - had special treatment to clean the blood prior to the transplant. 'It's good' His new face remains smooth and motionless, and his skull, skin and features are yet to be fully aligned. But he is positive about his recovery. ""If I hadn't accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It's a question of identity... But here we are, it's good, it's me,"" he told AFP news agency from the hospital, where he is still recovering. ""I'm 43 and the donor was 22 so I'm 22 again,"" he told French TV. The hours-long operation was led by Prof Laurent Lantieri, a specialist in hand and face transplants who carried out Mr Hamon's initial surgery eight years ago. ""Today, we know that a double transplant is feasible, it's no longer in the field of research,"" he told Le Parisien newspaper (in French). Anaesthetist Bernard Cholley said: ""Anyone who loses their face and then has to wait for a hypothetical transplant for an unknown length of time - that's something that no-one has ever had to go through here. ""I'm amazed by the courage of a patient who has been able to get through such an ordeal."" The first face transplant was carried out in 2005 in northern France. Since then, some 40 operations have been performed around the world.","The first person in the world to receive two facial transplants says he is feeling well, three months after his latest groundbreaking operation."
"Jatuporn Promphan and Nisit Sinthuprai were among nine opposition leaders charged with terrorism after the street protests in Bangkok a year ago. On Wednesday, historian Somsak Jeamteerasakul also faced a complaint that he insulted the monarchy. Thailand goes to the polls in early elections on 3 July. Mr Jatuporn was one of the most prominent ""red-shirt"" leaders during opposition protests last year. The ten-week protests, ended by a military crackdown on 19 May, left more than 90 people dead. Mr Jatuporn is a candidate for the Puea Thai political party, aligned to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and was reported to be planning to campaign from jail if necessary. Lawyers for the men said they would appeal the decision to revoke bail and offer higher sureties. The lese majeste complaint rests on rival interpretations of speeches given on 10 April this year to mark the anniversary of the first attempted crackdown on last year's protests. 'Political prisoners' The Department of Special Investigations (DSI) has tried repeatedly to get bail revoked for all the ""red-shirt"" leaders on the grounds that a condition for them not to incite unrest had been continually violated. Mr Jatuporn's immunity as a member of parliament expired on Tuesday when the house was dissolved to prepare for elections. Complaints of lese majeste and accusations of sedition have been lodged against more than a dozen ""red-shirts"". Thai academic Somsak Jeamteerasakul went to a police station on Wednesday to acknowledge a complaint laid against him by the country's powerful military. He told the Bangkok Post that the army had gone ""beyond the call of duty"" in pursuing such a wide range of lese majeste accusations. He described all those currently accused of lese majeste as ""political prisoners"" and said he would be fighting the complaint. The political temperature in Thailand has risen with the announcement of general elections, six months earlier than necessary. Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva says the polls will allow the country to move on from bitter divisions in recent years.

They note that no-one has been brought to court for the deaths that occurred during two military crackdowns on the protests last year.","A Thai court has revoked the bail of two ""red-shirt"" leaders and sent them to jail, citing security concerns about alleged insults against the monarchy."
"Pell was jailed for six years in March after being convicted of abusing two boys in Melbourne in the 1990s. The former Vatican treasurer is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes, but he has consistently maintained his innocence. After losing an earlier appeal, Pell now hopes his case will be heard by Australia's top court. However, there is no guarantee that the High Court of Australia will agree to review it. Last December, a jury unanimously convicted Pell of sexually abusing the 13-year-old boys inside Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral. The convictions included one count of sexual penetration and four counts of committing indecent acts. The verdict was kept secret from the public until February, when additional charges of sexual offences against Pell were withdrawn by prosecutors. The Australian cleric filed his application in the High Court of Australia on Tuesday. In his failed first appeal, Pell asserted that the guilty verdict had relied unreasonably on the testimony of one victim. His second victim died of a drug overdose in 2014. The grounds for his latest appeal bid have not been made public. Pell's conviction has rocked the Catholic Church, where he had been one of Pope Francis's closest advisers. He was demoted from the Pope's inner circle last year, but the Vatican continues to face calls for Pell to be defrocked. Pell will be eligible for parole in October 2022.",Cardinal George Pell has launched a final bid to overturn his convictions in Australia for child sexual abuse.
"Prominent figures, including princes, ministers and businessmen, were taken into custody last month. A statement said that 320 people have been called in for questioning while 159 are currently being detained. Those who denied the allegations or refused settlements face prosecution. The names of those held has still not been made public, but last week Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was once seen as a contender to the throne, was released after agreeing an ""acceptable settlement"" with authorities of more than $1bn (£750m). The nature of the charges also remains unclear but the attorney general's statement said ""internationally applied procedures"" had been followed. Detainees have been held in a luxury hotel in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has rejected as ""ludicrous"" analysts' suggestions the anti-corruption campaign was a power grab. Prince Mohammed, who at 32 is heir apparent, heads the anti-corruption committee and is the Saudi defence minister, told the New York Times many of those detained had already pledged allegiance to him. Many ordinary Saudis have welcomed the move to tackle corruption with the hope that some of their nation's oil wealth will be redistributed to the general population.","Most of those detained in a sweeping anti-corruption drive in Saudi Arabia have agreed settlements with the authorities in exchange for a pardon, the attorney general says."
"The Israeli-made spyware was only sold to governments, according to Citizen Lab, which is based in Canada. Mexican journalists, human rights activists and opposition politicians have made similar allegations. Mexico's government denies using the spyware to snoop on its opponents. It says it has only used intelligence tools in the interest of national security or to fight organised crime. The students, from an all-male college in the southern town of Ayotzinapa, were declared dead after disappearing in 2014 in the south-western state of Guerrero. Their relatives have accused the authorities of a cover-up. Some Mexicans have held out hope that members of the group may yet be found alive. Who are the latest alleged targets? The foreign experts, convened by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, were called in to investigate the disappearance of the students. The team has repeatedly accused the Mexican government of blocking their work. Citizen Lab, which is based at the University of Toronto, says in its analysis that it has found forensic evidence to show that the investigators' mobile phones were being targeted by Israeli-made spyware. One member, Spanish investigator Carlos Beristain, said the attempt to install spyware could be a ""more serious crime given the diplomatic protected status"" the group held. Attempts to infect their devices reportedly took place in March 2016, shortly after the group accused the Mexican government of hampering its inquiry, and as they were preparing a final report. How does the spyware work? The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by the Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists. It is usually sent in a text message to a smartphone. If the person taps on it, the spyware is installed, and huge amounts of private data - including text messages, photos, emails, location data, the device's microphone and camera - are hacked. One message sent to investigators in March was from someone pretending to pass on personal information about a funeral. ""Here are the details. I hope you can come,"" it read. According to the New York Times, the same link was sent last year to an academic trying to impose a sugar tax in Mexico and, in that case, the message was confirmed as a Pegasus trick. Mr Beristain said he had received the message but had not opened it as he suspected some form of espionage. Who are the missing students'? On the evening of 26 September 2014, a group of 43 Mexican students disappeared in Guerrero. They had been studying at an all-male teacher training college that has a history of left-wing activism. Before they disappeared, the students reportedly clashed with municipal police while on their way to a protest. Police opened fire on their buses. According to the official government report, the group was then handed over by corrupt officers to members of a local drugs gang. The government version of events says their bodies were burnt in a fire at a rubbish dump. Authorities identified one student, Alexander Mora, from charred bone they said they had found at the site, and they partially identified another. The international investigators have disputed the fire theory, saying they have yet to find sufficient evidence. The Mexican attorney general has declared them all dead but their relatives still want proof of what happened that night, and justice. The case is so well known in the country and across Latin America that the students are widely known simply as ""The 43"".","International experts investigating the suspected abduction and murder of 43 students in Mexico three years ago were targeted with government spyware, an internet watchdog says."

UoA's Dr Barbara Cheney said it was ""nice to know she's safe and sound"".

"Interfaith and inter-caste marriages have long been frowned upon in conservative Indian families, but in recent years, the conversation around such unions has become even more fractious. And most scorn is reserved for alliances involving Hindu women and Muslim men. Just how deep the chasm is was brought into sharp focus last month when popular jewellery brand Tanishq withdrew an advertisement featuring an interfaith couple after a right-wing backlash on social media. The ad showed a baby shower organised for a Hindu mum-to-be by her Muslim in-laws. Tanishq, owned by the Tatas, one of India's biggest companies, called its new range Ekatvam - which translates from Hindi as ""unity"". It was meant to celebrate the concept of ""unity in diversity"", but it ended up doing the exact opposite - it laid bare the fissures that exist in Indian society. Radical Hindu groups said the advert promoted ""love jihad"" - an Islamophobic term that implies Muslim men prey on Hindu women to seduce them and marry them with the sole purpose of converting them to Islam. Social media trolls led calls to boycott the brand, taking it to the top of Twitter trends. The company said in a statement that it withdrew the ad keeping in mind the safety of its employees. Two weeks after the row over the ad, journalist couple Samar Halarnkar and Priya Ramani and their journalist-writer friend Niloufer Venkatraman launched the India Love Project on Instagram, describing it as ""a celebration of interfaith/inter-caste love and togetherness in these divisive, hate-filled times"". Mr Halarnkar told the BBC they had been ""thinking about the project for a year, even more"" and that the controversy over the Tanishq ad lent it an immediacy, turning it into an idea whose time has come. ""We've felt very strongly about - and been disturbed by - the fake narrative around love and interfaith marriage,"" he told me. ""There is a narrative that there are other, more insidious, motives for marriage, that love is being weaponised. But we didn't know anyone who was thinking like that, who had any other motive than love for getting married."" Through India Love Project, he says, ""we are just providing a platform where people can share their stories"". Since 28 October - when the project kicked off with the first story by Ms Venkatraman about her Parsi mother Bakhtawar Master and Hindu father S Venkatraman - a new story has been published every day. The response, Mr Halarnkar says, has been overwhelming. ""We are struggling to cope. Every day we hear from people who say 'I want to tell my story, or my parents' story or my grandparents' story. It also shows that interfaith and inter-community marriages are not new, they were happening all along."" But, he adds, ""it's important to talk about them now more than ever"". ""At a time when hate is being manufactured, it's important to tell these stories of love and how widespread it is and that it's not just a flash in the pan."" In India, more than 90% of all marriages are arranged - and families rarely look beyond religion and caste while fixing alliances. According to the India Human Development Survey, only about 5% of marriages are inter-caste. Interfaith unions are even rarer - one study put them at just over 2.2%. And those choosing to marry outside of these boundaries often face violence - and can even be killed. In recent years, with a Hindu nationalist government in power, conservatism has gained support in India and religious polarisation has grown. And interfaith marriages - especially those involving Hindu women and Muslim men - are being ascribed a much more sinister motive. ""In February,"" Mr Halarnkar says, ""the government told the parliament that 'love jihad' was not defined by law and that no such cases were reported by any government agencies, but the idea persists. In recent days, at least four BJP-ruled states have announced plans to introduce legislation to curb this 'social evil'."" It is this ""narrative of hate"" that India Love Project seeks to challenge through its bank of personal stories, often described as ""warm and fuzzy"" by readers. The short 150-word stories are written with affection and humour; and tell tales of couples who believe that love does not recognise man-made boundaries. Rupa, a Hindu Brahmin, writes about her mother's first reaction when she told her that she was planning to marry Razi Abdi, a Muslim. ""He'll say 'talaq, talaq, talaq' three times and kick you out,"" her mother said, worried about the practice of instant divorce in Islam, now outlawed in India. ""However, once my parents met Razi and realised what a wonderful human being he was, their misgivings faded,"" she writes, describing them as ""relatively open-minded"". It's been 30 years since Rupa and Razi got married. They have two adult sons and celebrate the Muslim festival of Eid and the Hindu festival of Diwali in their home. Writing about his marriage with Salma, journalist TM Veeraraghav says in their home religion isn't ""as important as curd rice versus mutton biryani!"" ""I remain vegetarian, she enjoys her mutton and the product of our love [their child Ainesh] gets the best of both worlds. Ainesh is a Hindu or Muslim, depending on what's cooking."" In a recent post, Tanvir Aeijaz, a Muslim married to Vineeta Sharma, a Hindu, writes about the story of naming their daughter, Kuhu. The couple were asked whether it was a Hindu name or a Muslim name? And what religion would their daughter follow when she grows up? ""That our Hindu-Muslim marriage can be a role model of secularism seems to belie people's expectations,"" he writes. ""They're dumbfounded, almost disappointed that our love would have to be called love, and not love jihad."" The Instagram account also features stories of other interfaith and inter-caste marriages. Maria Manjil, a non-vegetarian Catholic from a liberal family in Kerala, who married Sadeep Jain, a north Indian vegetarian Jain from a conservative family, writes about the ""many challenges"" they've faced in their 22 years of marriage but is convinced that she did the right thing by marrying him.

"A statement from the prime minister's office said that an inquiry had unearthed ""major security breaches"" at Sri Lankan Airlines. The statement alleges irregularities in a $2.3bn purchase of 10 aircraft made under the previous government. The loss-making airline is 95% state-owned and 5% owned by staff. It is the latest in a string of corruption allegations made against the administration of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. 'Serious mishaps' The statement, issued by the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, accuses Mr Rajapaksa of making management changes within the airline to allow the $2.3bn-dollar purchase of 10 new aircraft ""despite the availability of more cost-effective alternatives"". The former chairman of the airline, Nishantha Wickramasinghe, is also singled out by the statement, accused of a ""gross abuse of power"". Mr Wickramasinghe - who is Mr Rajapaksa's brother-in-law - is accused of exposing the airline to ""reputational damage"" by his ""penchant for young air hostesses"", as well as falsifying documents to lease a luxury sports car. The statement also accuses the airline of attempting to ""hush-up two serious flying mishaps"", although no details are given. Mr Rajapaksa, in power since 2005, was defeated in an election in January 2015, by Maithripala Sirisena.","The Sri Lankan government has launched a criminal investigation into the country's national airline over allegations of ""shocking"" corruption."
"The DSCPA say two individuals attempted to ship the puppies from Dublin Port to Holyhead Port in North Wales. The dogs were held in ""hugely inappropriate"" conditions, cramped into small containers with ""little or no space, no food or water"". The raid was part of Operation Delphin, a collaboration between animal welfare organisations and other agencies. The puppies are thought to be about six or seven weeks old and the breeds included beagles, basset hounds, labradoodles and pomeranians. They have now been returned to Dublin and under DSPCA care. A number of them are ill and are undergoing veterinary care at a shelter in Rathfarnham. The operation was part of an intelligence-led raid and involved the border force intercepting two vehicles on different ferry crossings. Ian Briggs, of the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: ""These poor puppies were being carted into Wales in deeply inappropriate conditions in the early hours of the morning. ""Sadly, to unscrupulous dealers, these young pups are nothing more than a cash bonanza - and dealers would have been targeting tens of thousands of pounds from these shipments. ""This is another shocking example of people being readily prepared to act illegally and compromise the welfare of defenceless animals to make a quick buck - but, fortunately, they were stopped in their tracks."" Brian Gilles, CEO of the DSPCA, added, ""We are delighted with the outcome of this operation. ""We in the DSPCA believe that cooperating with agencies on both sides of the Irish Sea in sharing intelligence, resources and cooperating together will ultimately prevail against those who are involved in this disgusting, greedy trade.""",Almost 100 puppies have been seized as part of an operation into the illegal puppy trade from Ireland to the UK.
"Mr Santos said the death of Mono Jojoy marked the ""beginning of the end"" for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). He urged the rebels to demobilise or face a similar fate. Mono Jojoy was killed in a large-scale military assault on his jungle stronghold in eastern Colombia. President Santos was speaking on a visit to congratulate some of the hundreds of soldiers who took part in the raid. ""This operation against Mono Jojoy is a turning point, and I believe, with a good margin of confidence, that we can say this is the beginning of the end for the Farc,"" he said. 'No let-up' The president said he had ordered security forces to intensify their pursuit of the rebels in the wake of the most recent success. ""We are going to hunt them in the rivers, in the mountains, in the forests, in the swamps. There is no corner where we will not reach them"". Mr Santos added that information found on computers captured in the operation would allow the security forces to pursue ""each and every member of the organisation, their support networks, and their sources of finance"". Mono Jojoy, 57, also known as Jorge Briceno, was the Farc's military commander and led its strongest fighting unit, the Eastern Bloc. He was killed in a raid on a Farc stronghold in the Macarena mountain range in the eastern Colombian region of Meta. After a massive bombardment by air force planes and helicopters, around 800 troops attacked the camp on 22 September. The army said Mono Jojoy's body was found the next day, alongside at least 20 other dead guerrillas. He is the latest in a series of senior Farc leaders to die in recent years. The group suffered severe setbacks during the eight-year government of Mr Santos's predecessor, Alvaro Uribe, who made fighting the rebels his top priority. But it has shown that it is still has substantial offensive capability, killing at least 40 members of the security forces in attacks since Mr Santos took office in August. The Farc has been written-off as a fighting force several times during its five-decade campaign to take power, only to fight back, supported by revenues from cocaine-trafficking. The rebels have said they are prepared to find a political solution to the conflict, and have appealed to Mr Santos to enter talks.

"Charles Jenkins, 77, lived in Japan where he had settled with his family after his 2004 release. He was among four US soldiers who defected in the 1960s and later became North Korean film stars, but was the only one who was released. The others reportedly died in North Korea, including James Dresnok who was said to have died of a stroke in 2016. Charles Jenkins died on Sado island on Monday, where he was living with his wife Hitomi Soga, also a former prisoner of North Korea. He collapsed outside his home, Japanese media reports said, and later died of heart problems in hospital. His wife said in a statement that she was ""very surprised"" by his death and ""cannot think of anything"", according to AFP news agency. A plan that went wrong Mr Jenkins had led an extraordinary but also difficult life in North Korea, which he would later chronicle in a memoir and several interviews. In 1965, while stationed with the US Army in South Korea by the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), Mr Jenkins decided to abandon his unit and defect to the North, fearing he would be killed in patrols or sent to fight in the Vietnam War. He said he thought that once in North Korea, he could seek asylum with the Russian embassy, and eventually return to the US in a prisoner swap. One January night, Mr Jenkins said he downed several beers, walked across the DMZ, and surrendered to North Korean soldiers there. He was only 24 years old. But Russia did not grant him or the other Americans asylum. Instead, they were held as prisoners by the North Koreans. ""Thinking back now, I was a fool. If there's a God in the heaven, he carried me through it,"" said Mr Jenkins in a 2005 interview with US broadcaster CBS. The men were forced to study the teachings of then-leader Kim Il-sung; did translation work; and taught English. But they also became minor celebrities when they acted in North Korean propaganda films, starring as Western villains. Mr Jenkins said his captors often beat him, and conducted medical procedures on him that were sometimes unnecessary or brutal, including cutting off a US Army tattoo without anaesthesia, an experience which Mr Jenkins had described as ""hell"". 'Oyasumi' and 'Goodnight' But one bright spot in his life was Ms Soga, who was abducted from Japan to teach North Korean spies her language. In 1980, North Korean officials moved her in with Mr Jenkins. Within two weeks they were forced to marry, according to Mr Jenkins, but they eventually fell in love, bonded by their mutual hatred of their captors. ""Well, I'll put it like this. I looked at her one time. I wasn't letting her go,"" he told CBS. In his memoir, Mr Jenkins said that every night before they went to bed, he would say ""oyasumi"" (Japanese for goodnight) to his wife and she would respond in English. ""We did this so we would never forget who we really were and where we came from,"" he wrote. You might also like: The couple had two daughters, Mika and Brinda. Mr Jenkins said that as foreign prisoners, they were treated better than ordinary North Koreans and given rations, even during the famine that swept North Korea in the 1990s. In 2002, Ms Soga was freed after negotiations by the Japanese government. Pyongyang then allowed Mr Jenkins to leave two years later, along with their daughters. The family reunited under intense scrutiny from the press in Japan, where there was widespread sympathy. In Japan, he surrendered to the US Army, almost four decades after he had defected, and was court-martialled. He was eventually given a 30-day prison sentence, and a dishonourable discharge. 'North Korea wants me dead' The family settled in Sado island, Ms Soga's hometown, and Mr Jenkins eventually found work as a greeter in a tourist park. But he had to cope with the culture shock of adapting to the modern world, after spending so many years in an isolated country. He claimed he had never touched a computer, let alone used the internet, and was surprised to see many women serving in the army as well as black people working as policemen, according to CBS. He also suffered from lingering complications from medical procedures he received in North Korea and had to be hospitalised after his release, he told the Los Angeles Times in one of his last media interviews published in August. Even while living in freedom, Mr Jenkins still remained afraid of his former captors, and was constantly worried that he or his family would eventually be assassinated. ""North Korea wants me dead,"" he told the paper.",A former US sergeant who defected to North Korea and became Pyongyang's prisoner for nearly 40 years has died.
"Thousands of workers, who are paid on average $1.50 (£0.94) an hour, walked out a week ago demanding better wages. Unions say the strike paralysed operations at Papua province's Grasberg facility, where gold is also mined. The firm had played down the impact of the strike, saying it had stockpiled enough material to fulfil its orders. The workers returned to the mine on Wednesday. ""We agreed because the management have agreed to all of the union's demands,"" union official Virgo Solossa told Reuters late on Tuesday. Sinta Sirait, vice-president of the firm's Indonesian arm, told the Associated Press that Freeport and the union would open talks for a new contract on 20 July. ""We need everyone to get back to work as quickly as possible,"" she told reporters. ""Many sites are filling up with water. We have to get them dried out."" Freeport claims the Grasberg mine has the largest recoverable deposits of copper in the world, as well as the largest single gold reserve. Analysts say the strike, combined with bad weather and industrial unrest in Chile, has pushed up the price of copper around the world. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Jakarta says rights groups have often accused Freeport of stripping Papua of its rich natural resources without returning anything to the local community. But the company maintains that it is one of the largest employers in Papua, and without the jobs the Grasberg mine provides, many Papuans would be far worse off.

"In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements as marriage. Some, such as the UK couple who challenged the ban on civil partnerships for heterosexual couples, see traditional marriage as a patriarchal structure that ""has held women back"". Civil partnerships are referred to under different names in different countries around the world. Some call them civil unions, whilst other prefer to label them as domestic partnerships. But where are heterosexual civil partnerships permitted around the world? What's the situation in other European countries? The picture regarding civil partnerships varies greatly across Europe. Some countries have made their civil partnerships gender-neutral - that is to say, applicable to both same-sex and heterosexual couples. Others have restricted civil partnerships to same-sex couples only, and a few have scrapped the concept of civil partnerships after making same-sex marriage legal. In France, the civil solidarity pact gives both same-sex and heterosexual couples the right to enter into a civil partnership. These ""pacts"" give couples many of the same legal benefits as married couples, but they are easier to annul during the divorce process. Similar gender-neutral civil partnerships exist in the Netherlands (since 1998), Belgium (since 2000), Luxembourg (2004), Andorra (since 2005), Greece (they were originally set up for opposite-sex couples in 2008, however they have been gender-neutral since 2015), Gibraltar and Malta (since 2014), Cyprus (since 2015), and Estonia (since 2016). On the other hand, a number of European countries used to have civil partnerships for same-sex couples only, but got rid of them when they legalised same-sex marriage. Denmark was the world's first country to introduce civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 1989, scrapping the concept when it introduced same-sex marriage in 2012. Other Nordic countries (and Germany and Ireland) carried out similar processes, legalising civil partnerships but scrapping them when marriage for same-sex couples was legalised. What does a civil partnership offer? What's the situation in the Americas? In the US, laws regarding civil partnerships (known as ""civil unions"" or ""domestic partnerships"") are passed at a city or state level. New York City has offered domestic partnerships to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples (if they above 18 and resident in New York City) since 1997, while San Francisco has given legal recognition to the ''domestic partnership'' of homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples since 1989. In California as a whole, domestic partnerships have existed for same-sex couples and for opposite-sex couples in which one person is above the age of 62 since 2000. Similar laws exist in the states of Washington and New Jersey. In the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Maine and Maryland, gender-neutral civil partnerships are legal. In Brazil, co-habiting couples have similar rights to married couples, but they do not have the automatic right of inheritance. In Ecuador, civil unions between two people were legalised by the 2008 constitution, without any reference made to gender, opening the option to both heterosexual and same-sex couples. Uruguay permitted gender-neutral civil unions from 2008 too. Other countries that permit gender-neutral civil unions In South Africa, same-sex and heterosexual couples can register their relationships as either marriages or civil partnerships, with no legal difference. In Israel, a heterosexual couple are can enter a civil union-type agreement, where they are said to be ""known to the public,"" granting them legal rights without having to get married. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 26 countries around the world.","The UK's Supreme Court decided on 27 June to make civil partnerships available for heterosexual couples as well as same-sex couples,"
"Mark UrbanDiplomatic and defence editor, BBC Newsnight Somehow, the public seems to believe these things possible despite a public spending crisis, France's adherence to the new European Union Fiscal Compact (that will supposedly compel deficit reduction), and needing to improve its international competitiveness. Having attended campaign events in the past few days by incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Luc Melenchon - the presidential candidate of the Left Front - it is remarkable the degree to which these electoral realities have stood the campaign on its head, at least to somebody whose expectations are conditioned by the ""Anglo-Saxon"" political template. At his foreign policy launch, Mr Melenchon, who represents communists and trades unionists, spoke of France's, ""singular position"", noted it was the world's ""second most important maritime power"", and employed ""the world's second ranking diplomatic network"". Rejecting the clash of civilisations paradigm of confrontation with militant Islam, he asserted, ""France is not a Western country, it is a universalist country"". His presentation was full, in other words, of expressions of French exceptionalism, and of a national destiny based upon its unique culture and revolutionary ideals. Mr Melenchon has a particular anti-American axe to grind, but leaving that to one side, many of his measures of France's standing - such as the size of its diplomatic network or navy - crop up in the campaign statements of the centre left Socialist Party too. In this election the left, even the hard left, brandishes the national nuclear force with pride and is also very particular on the point of defending national sovereignty when it comes to EU austerity plans. The Socialist Party, whose candidate Francois Hollande currently looks like the man most likely to win the contest, has promised to renegotiate the Fiscal Compact formulated by ""Merkozy"" (ie France and Germany) last December. As for Mr Sarkozy, who represents the centre right, you might expect he would use an even more nationalistic political language. His slogan ""France Forte"" or ""Strong France"" seems to suggest such an agenda. But when you examine his positions in detail they can appear more moderate, and indeed internationalist, than those of his leading competitors. While Mr Sarkozy and those around him say that remaining within the new EU budgetary orthodoxies will not require the sacrifice of the French Model welfare state, they do hint at economic pain. Some close to the president acknowledge too that they have adopted an essentially German model of budgetary prudence rather than claiming they have a distinctively Gallic solution to the country's woes. Where has Mr Melenchon's curious marriage of communist and nationalist ideology got him? To fourth place in the polls, behind Sarkozy, Hollande and Marine Le Pen of the National Front as far as first round preferences go. The Left Front leader's 14% marks an increase of four points just in the past few weeks' campaigning. Some suggest he may even clinch third place, ahead of the two mainstream candidates. As for Mr Sarkozy, certain polls mark a small improvement in his first round standing, something critics argue has resulted from him taking right-wing positions on immigration, and security issues. However, when people are asked about how they might vote in the second round run-off that must follow if no candidate gains a majority on the first ballot (on 22 April), most polls show the president is stuck, 8% behind Mr Hollande. In that second stage of voting, with just two candidates, much of the Left Front vote could easily fall behind the Socialist leader. These then are the curious realities of this campaign: that the French public is worried that its way of life is under threat and is reluctant to choose austerity. The left meanwhile, even the hard left, knows that the soothing song of national greatness works far better for them than any British-style hair shirt politics of national sacrifice.","PARIS: In the presidential election campaign going on here, the candidates must tailor their message to a public that wants to protect the ""French model"" of a welfare state, coupled with a high-profile role in international politics and a strong defence."

"The northern city has been a key point of tension between Hindus and Muslims. In the past few months, there have been renewed calls to build a temple on the spot, where a 16th Century mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. The BBC explains why the holy site is back in the news: Why are people gathering in Ayodhya? Between 100,000 and 200,000 Hindus are expected to gather at Ayodhya on Sunday, demanding that a Hindu temple be built where the 16th Century Babri mosque once stood. Hindus believe the religious site in the state of Uttar Pradesh is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram. But Muslims say they have worshipped there for generations. Tensions between the two communities came to a violent head in 1992 when a Hindu mob destroyed the mosque. Nearly 2,000 people were killed in subsequent riots across the country. But now, after various attempts to claim ownership over the land by both religious groups, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been scaling up efforts to build a Hindu temple there. The crowds who are expected to gather at the site are from various hardline right-wing groups, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Shiv Sena. Local media reports say that walls in districts surrounding the site have been plastered with posters that show Lord Ram going to war. Others contain slogans that are essentially war cries against what they call the inability by previous governments to get the temple constructed. The situation has prompted a sense of panic and fear among Ayodhya's Muslim residents, many of whom have plans to leave the area before the crowds descend. ""This is the biggest build-up in favour of a temple since the mosque was destroyed. They are provoking the public. They are stirring up emotions,"" Ahmad, a Muslim community leader, told the Reuters news agency. Why is it back in the spotlight? The call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud in the last few months and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP. Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, sends more MPs to parliament than any other state. A big win in the state is essential for any party hoping to form the next government. Correspondents say the BJP appears to be attempting to galvanise Hindus in Uttar Pradesh along religious lines once again. The party's strategy paid off in 2014, when it managed to win 71 of the state's 80 seats. The BJP's projection of a united Hindu identity that superseded caste and class divisions and positioned them against those from ""other"" religions, is largely seen as having been responsible for that performance. This same momentum helped the party sweep state elections last year. But since that victory, and the instalment of the controversial Hindu hardliner Yogi Adityanath as chief minister, the BJP has lost several key local elections. One was a parliamentary by-election in Mr Adityanath's home constituency. Analysts say this could be due to a number of reasons, including farmers who are unhappy with the government after being badly affected by drought and declining productivity. The BJP may see Ayodhya as offering a way of reversing this trend. What is the row actually about? Hindus and Muslims have been at loggerheads over the Babri mosque for more than 100 years. Hindus say the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, and insist the Babri mosque was built there only after Muslim invaders destroyed a Hindu temple that stood there first. Muslims claim they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed idols of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols. Over the decades since, the two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site. What are the important legal developments so far? The Supreme Court, which is hearing a batch of pleas about the disputed site, has deferred its next hearing until January 2019. But there have been several interesting legal landmarks so far. In 2010, the Allahabad High Court said that the main site where the mosque stood should be split into three parts, with two-thirds given to Hindus and one-third to Muslims. The ruling also marked the first time any court had acknowledged the disputed site as the birthplace of Lord Ram. In 2011 the Supreme Court suspended this ruling after both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed. Since then, some 14 civil petitions have also challenged it. But another judgement worth noting is one from 1994 when the Supreme Court, which was ruling on a wholly separate case at the time, remarked that the mosque was ""not integral to Islam"". This particular line has bolstered the case made by Hindus who want control of the entire site. In April 2018, a senior lawyer named Rajeev Dhavan filed a plea before the top court, asking judges to reconsider this observation. But a few months later the Supreme Court declined to do so. As recently as last month, the same court rejected an urgent hearing into the civil petitions. ""We have other priorities,"" chief justice Ranjan Gogoi said, adding that the matter would be taken up early next year. Have religious tensions eased in India in recent years? Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions. Rabble-rousing by hardline ministers and Hindu groups has led to what many call greater anxiety in social relations. Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of more than 20 people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle. An uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism has also contributed to religious tension. The recent revival of the demand by some Hindu groups to construct the temple at Ayodhya through executive fiat - ignoring proceedings in the Supreme Court - is seen by many a renewed attempt to polarise the voters on religious lines ahead of the crucial 2019 elections.","Tens of thousands of Hindus, including monks and right-wing activists, are descending on the flashpoint Indian religious site of Ayodhya."

According to human rights group Amnesty International, prosecutors used 17 photos of Mawada against her as evidence of ""indecency"". Mawada said these images had been leaked from her phone after it was stolen last year. Mawada and the other four women began an appeal against their convictions on Monday, and the next hearing is scheduled for 14 September. At the very least, Rahma hopes her sister's sentence will be reduced. Mawada fainted when she heard the initial verdict, according to her lawyer, Ahmed Bahkiry. ""She's totally devastated - the charges are very vaguely worded."" ""Prison cannot be a solution, even if some of her videos go against our social norms and traditions,"" he adds. ""Prisons create criminals. The authorities could have resorted to rehabilitation instead."" There are mixed feelings in Egypt towards the case. Some in this largely Muslim, conservative country view TikTok videos such as Mawada's as indecent. Others say the girls were only having fun and do not deserve prison. Human rights groups see the girls' arrests as a further attempt by the authorities to restrict freedom of expression and as a sign of what Amnesty called ""new repressive tactics to control cyberspace"". There are, campaigners say, tens of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt, including liberals, Islamists, journalists and human rights lawyers. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi insists there are no prisoners of conscience in his country, while the state has questioned the credibility of critical human rights reports. 'Reckless and licentious' Among those calling for the girls' release is the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, a Cairo-based human rights organisation. Its executive director, Mohamed Lotfy, says the case shows clear signs of gender discrimination. ""Women are only allowed to express themselves on social media according to the state's dictations,"" he says. ""The girls are accused of breaching Egyptian family values, but no-one has ever defined these values."" Even if they were to be released, Mr Lotfy says a warning has already been sent to young girls. ""The authorities have made it clear: you are not free to say or do whatever you like, even if you are not talking politics at all. There are lines which are not to be crossed."" In recent months, the public prosecutor's office issued statements highlighting what it called the ""potential dangers threatening our youth via digital platforms, which are not subject to any sort of supervision"". It called on parents to help stop young people being ""misled into adopting a reckless and licentious lifestyle, in search of worthless fame and success"". ""They pursued illegal paths to make money, falsely believing this is a form of freedom of speech,"" it said. Meanwhile, as a result of what has happened, Rahma says their mother ""barely leaves her bed now"". ""She cries all the time,"" she says. ""Sometimes she wakes up at night and asks if Mawada is back home."" You may also be interested in:","""We were left in utter shock. She did nothing wrong - my sister is not a criminal,"" says Rahma al-Adham, talking of her younger sibling, a social media influencer in Egypt."
"By Nick ThorpeBBC News, Bulgaria Nodding quietly on the television screens, Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev looks perplexed. With good reason. Prime Minister Boiko Borisov has resigned and taken with him his entire cabinet. The opposition Socialists and third-placed Movement for Rights and Freedoms demand early elections in late April or early May. But the tens of thousands of Bulgarians whose street protests brought down the government insist that the parliament stay in place long enough to enact basic reforms which would fundamentally change Bulgarian democracy. The riot police outside the parliament building seem uncertain whether they are there to stop protesters getting in, or to help the protesters stop the deputies getting out. Fortunately for the president and the police, Bulgaria has long experience with street protests, caretaker governments and new political movements. 'No change' In 1997 the Socialist government fell after weeks of street barricades and hyper-inflation. The former King, Simeon of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, swept to parliamentary victory in the 2001 election, but never quite settled into the prime minister's chair. Boiko Borisov's GERB - Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria - won a handsome victory in 2009 with promises to root out corruption and end poverty - neither have succeeded. ""You could say that the fall of the government shows how responsive to the will of the people Bulgarian democracy is,"" said Daniel Smilov of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia. ""But from the point of view of those who want lower bills and higher incomes, nothing has changed. If anything, the situation has deteriorated. There is no address to whom to deliver the message."" While some commentators suggest that the prime minister's resignation was cowardly, others say he had no choice, and that Bulgaria would have faced a real revolution this week if he had clung on any longer. As the prime minister, a former bodyguard, came down the steps of parliament after the National Assembly approved the fall of his government, he looked apprehensive, even frightened. He headed first towards his own stalwart supporters, got entangled with a group of reporters and security men, headed back towards the building, then reluctantly shook hands with a few fans. Moments before, he had accused the leader of the mostly Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms of taking part in a plot to assassinate him. It later turned out that the alleged plot was eight years old. The former head of the secret services accused the prime minister of bandying state secrets around the floor of parliament. 'Getting carried away' ""The people on the streets range from the poorest, to the middle classes,"" said Angelo Slavchev, 31, one of three young men catapulted to prominence by the demonstrations. He was chosen by a loose assembly of protest organisers from 30 Bulgarian cities which met last weekend in the central town of Sliven. What does he think of the violence by some in the crowds, which led to bloody clashes with riot police a week ago? I asked. ""We conducted our own enquiry,"" he said. ""Our conclusion was that it was youths who got carried away. It won't happen again - we proved that on Sunday."" Tens of thousands marched through Sofia and other cities that day, in the biggest show of strength since the government fell. The task facing Angelo Slavchev and his fellow organisers of the protests looks as daunting as that faced by the president - how to keep the momentum of the street protests, and how to channel all the demands of the streets into a programme. ""We will not form a political party,"" he insists. Socialist boost In Socialist Party headquarters in Pozitano Street, Sergei Stanishev, the party leader and Bulgaria's prime minister from 2005 to 2009, chose his words carefully. ""We are in favour of a radical change, for a democratic and social Bulgaria,"" he told the BBC. ""The democratic achievements of the past two decades, including the building of civil society and a welfare state, was dismantled by this government. ""The thousands on the streets do represent an important part of society but there are many other people who have party-political sympathies. And for the first time, we are leading in the polls."" Vihren, a psychologist who joined the protest on Sunday with his wife Maja and two daughters, said: ""I came here today for truth, for liberty and for justice. ""Especially justice, because this is a big problem in our society.""",A week of turmoil in Bulgaria has seen politics spill out of parliament and on to the streets again.
"After that time, during which Venezuelans will be able to deposit them into their account or exchange them for different notes or coins, the banknotes will no longer be legal tender. While people will be given a 10-day grace period in which they can exchange the bills at the central bank, many fear that long queues and the sheer number of 100-bolivar notes in circulation - six billion - will make it impossible for everyone to do so. Twitter user @RPolicial imagined what his trip to the bank would look like. Many suggested alternative uses for the bills. One of the most popular ones was using the notes as toilet paper, which has been scarce amid the chronic shortages of basic goods Venezuela is experiencing. Satirical website La Patilla joked that they could be used instead of candles on the Christmas tree and set alight. Others suggested using the bills to play Monopoly. Some compared the short time span people have been given to exchange the notes with the film Saw (Spanish title: Juegos Macabros, or Macabre Games) in which the two protagonists have been trapped by a sadistic serial killer and must complete a perverse puzzle to survive.","Venezuelans have been trying to think of uses for their highest-denomination banknote, the 100-bolivar bill, after President Nicolas Maduro announced it would be taken out of circulation within 72 hours."
"Earlier Russia's best-known gay rights campaigner, Nikolay Alexeyev, had gone to court hoping to overturn the city council's ban on gay parades. He had asked for the right to stage such parades for the next 100 years. He also opposes St Petersburg's ban on spreading ""homosexual propaganda"". The European Court of Human Rights has told Russia to pay him damages. On Friday he said he would go back to the European Court in Strasbourg to push for a recognition that Moscow's ban on gay pride marches - past, present and future - was unjust. The Moscow city government argues that the gay parade would risk causing public disorder and that most Muscovites do not support such an event. In September, the Council of Europe - the main human rights watchdog in Europe - will examine Russia's response to a previous European Court ruling on the gay rights issue, Russian media report. In October 2010 the court said Russia had discriminated against Mr Alexeyev on grounds of sexual orientation.

"Those detained include eight Saudis, a Turk, and a Lebanese citizen. Eighteen people were arrested in the same case in March. Saudi Arabia, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim, has recently repeatedly found itself at odds with Iran, an overwhelmingly Shia Muslim nation. Iran has denied any involvement in spying in Saudi Arabia. Those arrested in March included an Iranian, a Lebanese and 16 Saudis. The Lebanese suspect has subsequently been released, officials said. Shortly after their detention, the Saudi authorities said the suspects were gathering information about installations and vital areas, and were linked to Iranian intelligence services. Saudi Arabia's Shia minority is concentrated in the country's eastern province, and community leaders there were quoted by Reuters news agency as saying all the Saudi suspects detained in March were Shia.

"It was discovered during repair work at Castle Cornet in Guernsey. During the 17th Century conflict, the Channel Island was on the side of Parliamentarians but the castle remained the last stronghold in the British Isles loyal to King Charles I. The under-siege fortification was often fired on from nearby St Peter Port. Today, the castle is connected to Guernsey by a causeway, but during the conflict it was a cut-off island fortress, which held out for nearly ten years (1642-51). The 350-year-old cannonball was found ""quite deep"" in a castle wall by stonemasons, Guernsey Museums' Dr Jason Monaghan said. More Guernsey stories and news. ""It's probably why nobody ever breaked it out. ""In the past they picked up the cannonballs that were fired here and basically fired them back - because they didn't explode in those days,"" Dr Monaghan added. During the English Civil War the castle was the home of Guernsey's governor, appointed by the king. It relied heavily on supplies by boat from the neighbouring island of Jersey, which was also Royalist. These boats were often targets for parliamentarian cannons, Dr Monaghan said. ""This probably came from one of those exchanges. ""We know there was a battery up at St Barnabus that used to shoot at the Castle - it's exactly the right sort of distance and direction for a cannonball to come thumping in,"" he said. Neighbouring Jersey's Royalists were eventually subdued following Charles I's defeat by Cromwell at Worcester, cutting the Guernsey castle off, and forcing it to surrender in 1651.","A ""small football-sized"" cannonball thought to have been fired during the English Civil War has been found wedged in a wall."
"The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusations in a tweet. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. What happened in the attack on Eritrea? On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday, in a tweet, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. Analysis: Two men with a common enemy By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. How bad is the violence? Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. Why are the government and TPLF fighting? The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join. The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea. The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.",The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated.
"The 55-year-old, whose real name is Mark Calaway, said in a recent documentary that there was ""nothing left for [him] to conquer"". His words suggest plans to retire after a career spanning three decades. But neither Mr Calaway nor the WWE have formally announced his retirement from the league. The Dead Man, as he is nicknamed, made the comments during the new WWE biopic The Last Ride. He spoke about his most recent match against wrestler AJ Styles, which ended with him burying his opponent and riding away on a motorcycle. ""It was a perfect moment. You don't necessarily always get those. If there was ever a perfect ending to a career, that right there was it,"" Mr Calaway said. ""It's time this cowboy really rides away,"" he added. ""I can do more good outside the ring than I can inside. I'm finally at a place where I can accept that."" He said he would consider returning for one last match, but that ""only time would tell"". Mr Calaway has been a multiple world heavyweight champion, six-time tag team title holder and winner of the Royal Rumble. He began his career with World Class Championship Wrestling in 1987, and moved to the WWE in the 1990s as a final member of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Team. Mr Calaway is also known as a WWE pioneer. He was part of the first Casket Match at Survivor Series in 1992, the first Buried Alive match in 1996 and the inaugural Hell in a Cell match in 1997. Despite enormous popularity, however, he has not chosen to follow superstars like John Cena or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson into movies. He told the BBC last month that he ""had opportunities to do so"" but had decided against it. ""It doesn't work for me,"" said Mr Calaway. ""Wresting and WWE is my passion. It's where I've completely invested and where my heart is at."" On Sunday, he tweeted a clip from The Last Ride and wrote ""you can never appreciate how long the road was until you've driven to the end"". His revelation has prompted a wave of supportive messages on social media, using the hashtag #ThankYouTaker. AJ Styles said he would be ""honoured"" if their fight had been The Undertaker's last. Ring announcer Mike Rome also paid tribute to the wrestling star, saying ""thank you for making our childhood so cool."" There has been speculation in previous years about his retirement. In 2017, after losing a match to Roman Reigns, Mr Calaway dropped his iconic gloves, hat and trenchcoat in the middle of the ring before walking backstage.","WWE wrestling star The Undertaker has received an outpouring of support on social media after saying he had ""no desire to get back in the ring""."
"At his annual news conference, Vladimir Putin said contacts between the Trump team and Russian officials before last year's election were normal. He said the US opposition was not treating those who elected Mr Trump with respect. The Trump campaign is being investigated for collusion with Russia. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump, but Mr Putin denies the allegations. ""It's all invented by those in opposition to Trump to make his work seem illegitimate,"" Mr Putin said, when asked about the investigation. He added that Mr Trump was responsible for some ""quite serious achievements"" but had not been in a position to improve relations with Russia. He expressed hope that this would happen, adding that globally ""there are many things we can do more effectively"". Also mentioned by Mr Putin: What about the election? Earlier Mr Putin addressed the presidential elections, due to be held next year. He has already said he will stand for a fourth term, but announced that he would stand as an independent candidate rather than from the ruling United Russia party. What does he think about the opposition? Asked why he had not faced any effective opponent for the presidency, he said the opposition had to come up with specific proposals to improve people's lives and had so far not done so. ""It's not up to me to nurture competitors,"" he said. ""But... I've been thinking that our political environment must be competitive just like the economic environment. ""I hope this will happen, and the sooner the better."" But he said if his opponents won in the presidential election next March, it would destabilise Russia. ""Do you want attempted coups d'etat?"" he asked, in response to a question about the opposition. Mr Putin did not mention opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is banned from standing in the elections because of a criminal conviction. The Council of Europe has condemned the conviction as ""arbitrary and unfair"". In response to Mr Putin, Mr Navalny tweeted (in Russian) a link to his recently published election programme, with the words: ""You're really trying very hard not to notice this."" Election rival asks a question Another opposition presidential candidate was noticed by the president, however. Kseniya Sobchak, a celebrity and political talk show host, has announced she will be running against Mr Putin as a ""referendum on trust"" so that people can vote against him. She came to the news conference as a journalist for the opposition Dozhd TV and asked Mr Putin about the repression of the opposition, including Mr Navalny, and whether the authorities were afraid of competitors. He responded by warning of rabble-rousing politicians destabilising the country, and he cited Ukraine as a country where instability was rife. ""I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of Russians don't want this,"" he said, adding that he was not afraid of anyone. Mr Putin is known for his marathon performances at his news conferences, where he frequently uses hard-hitting, colourful language. The record for a Putin news conference was set in 2008, at four hours 40 minutes. This year's, which went on for nearly four hours, has also set a record, with 1,640 journalists said to be accredited for the event. Putin has removed all serious rivals Analysis: BBC's Steve Rosenberg, Moscow There was an element of farce to the president's end-of-year media extravaganza. Reporters shouted from their seats and waved signs to attract his attention and ask him a question. One man who asked Mr Putin about fish admitted half way through his question that he wasn't a reporter at all, but the head of a fish processing factory who had lied to get in. At one point, Mr Putin pointed to a sign he thought read Bye Bye Putin. Instead it read Grandfather Putin in the Tatar language. Russia isn't likely to be saying bye bye to its president any time soon. Mr Putin will run for re-election next March and is expected to win. The system of power he has built in Russia - often referred to as ""managed democracy"" - has managed to remove all serious rivals There will be other challengers, among them the liberal TV personality Kseniya Sobchak, who was at the conference. In the increasingly farcical world of Russian politics, Ms Sobchak is widely viewed as a spoiler candidate, hired by the Kremlin to boost the legitimacy of the election and to split the opposition vote.

"He told the BBC the causes of that conflict were complex and Kigali should not be singled out for blame. He also said it was wrong to withhold aid to Rwanda, as many Western countries have done. Rwanda denies a UN accusation that it has been backing the Congolese M23 rebel group. About 800,000 people have been displaced in fighting since May 2012 when the rebels launched a rebellion against the DR Congo government. Last year, a report by the UN Security Council's Group of Experts said that M23 leaders ""receive direct military orders"" from Rwanda's chief of defence staff, Gen Charles Kayonga, ""who in turn acts on instructions from the minister of defence"", Gen James Kabarebe. Mr Blair acts as a personal adviser to Mr Kagame - who came to power after the 1994 genocide - and one of his charities, the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), employs people inside the Rwandan government. ""If you read, and I have read, both the UN report and the very detailed rebuttal of those claims by the Rwandan government, you've got to say there's a dispute over the facts,"" Mr Blair told the BBC's Focus on Africa TV programme. He said there were a dozen different small militias in DR Congo, complicating the situation for the government. ""I'm not disputing the need to make sure that everybody abides by the right international principles here, I'm simply saying it isn't right to put all of this on Rwanda ,"" he said. Rwanda had made good use of the aid money and there had been massive poverty reduction in the country, Mr Blair said. Rwanda had ""virtually eliminated measles in the country, now moving on to rubella"". ""The way they've reduced malaria deaths by something like 60%. These are massive achievements done through aid. ""To withdraw the aid in those circumstances seems to me a way to punish the Rwandan people without necessarily helping the issue of the conflict."" Mr Kagame's critics accuse him of leading a repressive regime, which jails opponents and cracks down on the media. Last October, opposition leader Victoire Ingabire was convicted of treason and sentenced to eight years in jail. She denied the charge.","Former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has defended Rwanda over its part in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Humeyra Öz was attacked in the bike-shed at Rotterdam's Design College shortly after her lessons finished on Tuesday afternoon. A 31-year-old man has been arrested. The girl's friends said she had broken up with him some time ago and had complained of being threatened by him. Police confirmed that she knew the suspect but did not give further details. 'How could it happen?' The college has some 300 students and some of them were in the bike shed at the time of the shooting and saw what happened. Both the victim and suspect were described as members of the Dutch-Turkish community, and Turkish consul Aytac Yilmaz visited the school on Wednesday. Fellow pupils struggled to take in the killing, while parents were concerned about safety. ""She was a lovely, pretty, clever girl,"" a schoolfriend told Dutch media. ""We're still really scared. How could it happen?"" College chairman Marc Otto said he was unable to talk about any threats made against the victim as it was part of the police inquiry, but insisted that safety at the school was not in question. ""This is about someone older who suddenly comes into a school - this isn't a prison,"" he said. Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb said the attack should not be considered as a school shooting but involved a deranged man who could have carried out the attack anywhere. Once the Christmas holidays were over, he said, he hoped things could return to normal. 'Why was he still free?' Humeyra Öz had got to know the suspect, identified as Bekir E, via Facebook two years ago and had ended their relationship on the site too, Dutch media said. ""Her family even went to talk to his family. They said she was too young,"" a cousin told the Volkskrant website. ""But he kept harassing and threatening her."" Friends said her father would take her to school because of the threats made against her. The cousin said the family had filed a complaint against Bekir E around a year ago and that he had recently been given a two-year jail term. Public prosecutors have confirmed that the suspect was convicted recently and was under the supervision of the probation service, but did not specify the charge.","Students, teachers and families in the Dutch city of Rotterdam have expressed their shock after a 16-year-old pupil was shot dead in the grounds of her college."

"UN figures tracking registered refugees show the human tide began in earnest in early 2012, as widespread protests gave way to armed conflict, and reached a peak early last year amid claims the government had used chemical weapons. Ahead of the country's presidential elections on 3 June, the ongoing violence continues to force people to flood across the country's borders. Notes on the data: The data above reflects the date when Syrians registered as refugees (sometimes many days or weeks after fleeing) up to the end of April, according to figures collected by the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR. Figures are regularly reviewed, meaning some months may see a dip in numbers. Figures reflect registrations and not every person who has fled Syria. The true figures are estimated to be much higher. Impact on regions Perhaps unsurprisingly, data from the UN also shows the largest exodus to four of the main destination countries has been from provinces that have seen the greatest conflict. Deraa - the starting point of the uprising - Homs and Aleppo have seen most people flee. The figures below show the regional breakdown for people leaving for Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. A breakdown by region of origin for other destinations is not available. Notes on the data: The UNHCR tracks the origin of Syrian refugees registered to receive assistance in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. Comparable data is not available for North Africa or Turkey. In Turkey, information is collected separately by the Turkish government. Figures reflect registrations up to the end of April 2014 and not every person who has fled Syria. The ethnicity factor The refugee registration data also suggests that while the largest departures have come from regions with strong anti-government movements, fewer Syrians have left provinces that are home to ethnic groups regarded as government supporters. However, the figures do not cover departures to North Africa or Turkey, the nearest countries to some of those areas, which may explain some of the shortfall.

"By Bill HaytonAuthor The reality is a little more complex. Although passions are certainly rising over the fate of a few specks of rock in the South China Sea, this is not simply jingoism at work. The first clue is that those most of the ""Chinese"" factories that are being smashed up aren't, in fact, Chinese. Journalists have no access to the industrial parks where the protests have been concentrated so we can only make informed guesses about what is going on and why. However, going on the information reaching my colleagues in the BBC's Vietnamese Service, the riots tell us more about the conditions inside those factories than about geopolitics. This is not to deny that many Vietnamese are livid about China's attempt to drill for oil in waters claimed by Vietnam. There were angry protests about the issue outside the Chinese embassy in Hanoi and its consulate in Ho Chi Minh City over the weekend. These were the usual small affairs and they were tolerated by the government. That tolerance can be explained by the ruling Communist Party's need to impress two audiences: its own people and its foreign sparring partners. The Communist Party of Vietnam is an intelligent organisation. It knows that there is widespread anger about China's moves in the South China Sea (or the East Sea as it is known in Vietnam). It also knows that its critics, particularly overseas-based anti-communists, accuse it of kowtowing to China. If it cracks down too hard on ""patriotic"" demonstrators, the party will be accused of betraying the national interest. It also knows that its negotiating position with China will be much stronger if it can prove that the domestic cost of making compromises will be too great. This is the usual explanation for instances of anti-China demonstrations in Vietnam (and, not coincidentally, also of anti-Japan protests in China). The party is furious about China's installation of an oil rig near the Paracel Islands. A bit of street action helps to bolster its position in dealings with its brother communists in Beijing and allows hotheads to let off a bit of steam. 'Invaders' However, the scale and extent of the vandalism and rioting that we have seen in the past few days is something new and shocking. It has a different explanation. There are several accounts of what triggered the rioting. Some say it began at an officially-sanctioned protest that got out of hand. Others have suggested that an American-based organisation of anti-Communist Vietnamese exiles, Viet Tan, may have played a role. Both may be true but neither would explain why the protests became so large and so violent so quickly. There are other factors at work. Thomas Jandl is an expert on Vietnam, based at American University in Washington DC. He points to the growing discontent among Vietnam's rapidly-growing industrial workforce. ""Riots can easily start over minor issues that then get conflated with others. These are factory workers, not political science or history scholars. They have 'Chinese' overseers, they feel that these people are not nice to them and now they - or someone like them - is invading the country,"" he says. Over the past few years there have been dozens of strikes at foreign-owned plants in Vietnam. Complaints about low pay, bad workplace conditions (poor canteen food, limits on using the toilet and so on) and bullying management have triggered disputes. These complaints have focused on plants owned by Taiwanese and Korean companies in particular. However, Thai and Singaporean plants have also been affected. Perfect storm? To these traditional complaints, a major new one has been added. Some factories, particularly Taiwanese-owned plants have been employing Chinese workers in favour of local Vietnamese. This appears to have been the trigger for the trouble in the central province of Ha Tinh, in which one Chinese person was killed and 90 others injured. What we are witnessing in Vietnam is an inchoate sense of anger - partly against China but more urgently against bad employers. This is a nightmare scenario for the Communist Party of Vietnam. It will be easy for protestors to paint it as betraying the national interest out in the South China Sea (by failing to stand up strongly enough to China) and weak at home for failing to ensure that foreign companies treat their workers fairly. Add in a myriad of other personal and local grievances and a wrong move could stir up a perfect storm of anti-""system"" protest. The party has the means to put hundreds of thousands of security personnel on the streets within hours if the threat to its rule becomes significant. However that would be a last resort for an organisation that claims to be the living embodiment of the people's will. The ramifications of the decisions the party takes in the next few days will be felt for some time. Bill Hayton, who works for BBC Media Action, is the author of Vietnam: rising dragon (Yale 2010) and The South China Sea and the struggle for power in Asia, to be published by Yale in September.",Dramatic images of Vietnamese workers vandalising Chinese-owned factories appear to be yet more proof that an angry nationalism is taking hold in East and South East Asia.
"Hatice Cengiz, a Turkish citizen, tweeted that the ""heinous murder does not have a statue of limitations"". Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018. Saudi officials say this was a ""rogue operation"" not sanctioned by the state. This account has been doubted globally. Among those questioning the official Saudi line were some intelligence agencies and the United Nations. Khashoggi had been writing for the Washington Post newspaper and living in the US before his death. After offering changing accounts of his disappearance, Saudi authorities eventually admitted he was killed in a botched operation by a team tasked with getting him to return to the country. In December 2019, a court sentenced five unnamed men to death for their role in his killing after a secretive trial in Riyadh. A UN special rapporteur, Agnes Callamard, labelled the Saudi trial the ""antithesis of justice"" and urged an independent investigation. What has Khashoggi's fiancée said? On Friday, Hatice Cengiz wrote on Twitter that Jamal Khashoggi had become ""an international symbol bigger than any of us, admired and loved."" Ms Cengiz added that ""Jamal was killed inside his country's consulate while getting the docs to complete our marriage. The killers came from Saudi with premeditation to lure, ambush [and] kill him."" There are two, diametrically opposed versions to this story. In one, widely carried by the Saudi government-controlled media, the family of Jamal Khashoggi has forgiven his killers. This would be in line with the public stance adopted by his son, Salah, who was filmed accepting the condolences of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the man suspected by many of being personally behind the killing. But Salah still lives in Saudi Arabia, and there are suspicions he has been coerced into issuing the pardon. So the opposing view, as voiced by Khashoggi's fiancée and also by the UN special rapporteur who investigated the murder, is that this is all part of a cover-up by the Saudi authorities. They believe that the true culprits are still at large and that justice has yet to be served. None of this is likely to receive much attention in the media in Saudi Arabia, a country now hit by the twin blows of coronavirus and collapsing oil revenues. What about Khashoggi's son's comments? Earlier, a statement was posted to the Twitter account of Salah Khashoggi, one of the late journalist's sons who lives in the Saudi city of Jeddah. ""In this blessed night of the blessed month [of Ramadan] we remember God's saying: If a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah,"" it said. ""Therefore we the sons of the Martyr Jamal Khashoggi announce pardoning those who killed our father, seeking reward God almighty."" Death sentences can be commuted in light of a pardon by the victim's family under Islamic law, but it is not clear whether that will apply in this case. Salah has previously issued statements expressing his confidence in, and support of, the Saudi investigation. He has also previously criticised ""opponents and enemies"" of Saudi Arabia who he said had tried to exploit his father's death to undermine the country's leadership. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Khashoggi's children had received homes and monthly payments as compensation for the killing of their father. But Salah, Khashoggi's eldest son, was the only sibling who intended to carry on living in Saudi Arabia, the newspaper said. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The journalist - who had gone into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017 - went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 seeking documents to get married to fiancé Hatice Cengiz. Investigators believe that he was murdered and dismembered while she waited outside, but his remains have never been recovered. Saudi officials initially claimed he had left the building alive and their account of events changed several times in the weeks after his disappearance. Details of his gruesome killing shocked the world, and a subsequent UN report said there was credible evidence that the crown prince and other high-level Saudi officials were individually liable. The prince has denied any involvement in the murder, but has said he took ""full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government"".","Murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's fiancée has said ""no-one has the right to pardon his killers"" after his son said he forgave them."
"On Friday he congratulated Socialist Party leader Pedro Sánchez, who will become prime minister after the ballot. Mr Sánchez, who needs 176 votes, filed the no-confidence motion after Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP) was implicated in a corruption scandal. Mr Rajoy will be the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be defeated in such a motion. On Friday, as debate on the no-confidence motion resumed for a second day, he told parliament that it has been ""an honour to leave a better Spain than I found"". He said me hoped Mr Sánchez would be able to ""say the same"". The opposition Socialists have secured support for the non-confidence motion from various smaller parties, including the Basque Nationalist Party - which has a crucial five seats in parliament. Why was the vote called? Mr Sánchez says Mr Rajoy, 63, had failed to take responsibility for his party's involvement in the scandal, which returned under scrutiny last week after one of its former treasurers was given a 33-year jail sentence. The High Court in Madrid convicted Luis Bárcenas of receiving bribes, money laundering and tax crimes. The case centred on a secret campaign fund the PP ran from 1999 until 2005. Many Spanish voters, exasperated by corruption scandals involving the traditional centre-right PP and centre-left Socialist parties, have abandoned them for newcomers like the left-wing Podemos (We Can) and centrist Ciudadanos (Citizens), as well as regional parties. Who is Pedro Sánchez? Analysis by Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Pedro Sánchez emerged as a virtual unknown to win the Spanish Socialist party premiership in 2014. The photogenic economist and former basketball player won members over with a promise to unite a divided party and put the Socialists back in power. Yet he subsequently suffered two humbling election defeats, in 2015 and 2016. He was eventually forced to resign after his refusal to back Mariano Rajoy in an investiture vote plunged the country into a prolonged political stalemate and his party into bitter infighting. Months later he confounded his many critics by returning to win the Socialist primary. Spain's constitution states that the party presenting a no-confidence motion must be prepared to govern and replace the deposed prime minister if a parliamentary majority backs it. Therefore this moderate but ambitious 46-year-old from Madrid is set to be Spain's new prime minister, despite the fact that his party commands less than a quarter of seats in Congress. Could Mariano Rajoy step down? ""Resign, Mr Rajoy, your time is up. Resign and this no-confidence motion ends here,"" Mr Sánchez said during the two-day debate that began in parliament on Thursday. ""Staying on as prime minister is harmful and is a burden not only for Spain but also for your party."" Mr Rajoy insisted he would stay put and accused the Socialists of opportunism. ""Mr Sánchez is concerned because he is not doing any better in the polls and he has realised that he will never reach government through elections,"" he added. Mr Rajoy's resignation ahead of a vote would prevent Mr Sánchez from taking power and usher in a caretaker period of weeks, possibly months, before a new PM is sworn in. If he loses, however, Mr Sánchez is likely to replace him immediately. The PM did not return to parliament for the afternoon session. Instead he remained at a restaurant for about 10 hours, with various cabinet members visiting him over lunch and during the course of the afternoon, Spanish media reported. Also on Thursday, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) confirmed that it would support the no-confidence motion. ""We believe we are responding to what most Basques want and best complying with our responsibility by voting yes [to the motion],"" said party spokesman Aitor Esteban. Mr Rajoy currently has the support of the PP, Ciudadanos and two regional parties, which between them can only muster 169 votes.",Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is set to be forced out of office in a motion of no confidence.
"By Muhammad ShukriBBC Monitoring Yousef is only one of thousands of school teachers in areas of Yemen controlled by the rebel Houthi movement who have been forced to find an alternative income after not being paid for a year. ""I have two children, my wife, my little sister and my brother, and I am the only bread winner for all of them,"" he told the BBC. ""The kids want to eat. When they fall ill, they need medication. And if we do not pay the rent, we can be expelled from the place we live in,"" he added. ""There was no option but to quit."" Financial hardship A conflict in Yemen has divided the country and brought the economy to its knees. The UN says more than 8,500 people, most of them civilians, have been killed since March 2015, when a Saudi-led Arab coalition launched a military campaign in support the government of exiled President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi in its battle with the Houthis. The war has also left 20.7 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 775,000 people and caused 2,130 deaths. Education is one of the many public services to have been affected by the fighting. The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) says at least 2 million children are now out of school. More than 1,700 schools are currently unfit for use due to conflict-related damage, the hosting of displaced people, or occupation by armed groups. At least 166,443 teachers - approximately 73% of the national total - have also not received their salaries since October 2016, according to the Unicef mission in Yemen. They are among 1.5 million civil servants only paid sporadically over the past year. On strike The Houthis announced that the academic year would start on 30 September, but a call by the teachers' union for a strike over pay has been widely heeded, with only a fraction turning up for work. Hana, a female teacher at a primary school in Sanaa, told the BBC that alongside the industrial action, teachers had also been making representations to international organisations, including the UN. ""But the Houthis are now trying to thwart our industrial action by inviting volunteers to fill in,"" she said. The strike is not only taking place only in rebel-held areas. Teachers working in territory under the control of the Hadi government are also protesting over pay. Khalid Wakid, a deputy head teacher at Shamsan Primary School, says that the proportion of teachers on strike in some schools in Aden is as high as 90%. ""This mainly occurs in schools with a high number of teachers appointed in 2011. This is because the teachers appointed that year are paid low salaries - about 40,000 rials [$160; £120] a month."" ""But the aim of the strike in Aden and the southern areas is to get better pay. We still receive our salaries."" Learning hit The industrial action is crippling what is left of the education system. According to figures made available to the BBC by the Unicef mission, 12,240 of the 15,826 functioning schools in Yemen are affected by the strikes. ""A total of 4.38 million school students attend these schools - 78% of all students in Yemen,"" said Rajat Madhok, the mission's chief of communication and advocacy. Unicef says more than 600,000 children have benefited from the rehabilitation of 754 schools, and that 166,287 students have been supported through new and repaired school desks. Almost 800,000 students have also been provided with basic learning supplies such as school bags and other kits. But this is still a small proportion of the children whose future is another casualty of an increasingly damaging conflict.

"Mr Thaci and others ""are criminally responsible for nearly 100 murders"", torture and enforced disappearances, the prosecutor said. The accusations - covering Kosovo's independence war against Serbia - are being assessed by a judge at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers who will decide if the case goes to trial. Mr Thaci has denied any wrongdoing. In its announcement, the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) said that, on 24 April, it had filed a 10-count indictment with the KSC ""for the Court's consideration"". It has not released details about the alleged war crimes. ""The Indictment is only an accusation. It is the result of a lengthy investigation and reflects the SPO's determination that it can prove all of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt,"" it said. The statement also said Mr Thaci and another of the accused, Kosovo politician Kadri Veseli, have sought to ""obstruct and undermine"" the SPO's work ""in an attempt to ensure that they do not face justice"". A pre-trial judge now has six months to decide if the court will issue charges. Allegations of organ-trafficking against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) - the rebel movement that Mr Thaci led - were first set out by a former Hague war crimes prosecutor, Carla del Ponte in 2008. The EU-backed court was set up to investigate the claims. Kosovo's government has angrily denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless and defamatory"" ahead of the publication of a report in 2010. Mr Thaci has been in power in Kosovo since the end of the war - most recently as president of Kosovo. The independence war in 1998-1999 cost more than 10,000 lives and only ended after a Nato air campaign. Kosovo declared its independence in 2008, something Serbia still does not recognise. Mr Thaci was due to travel to Washington DC for planned talks with Serbia's leadership in the White House on Saturday. He has now cancelled the trip. The Kosovo Specialist Chambers (KSC) has suddenly broken its silence in the most dramatic manner. It has not just revealed that Kosovo's president is the subject of an indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but also accused him of ""repeated efforts… to obstruct and undermine the work"" of the court. For anyone who has ever attempted to get information from the KSC, this is a staggering development. The court has revealed virtually nothing about its work since it was established in 2016. Even when Kosovo's former Prime Minister, Ramush Haradinaj, said that he had been questioned as a suspect last year, there was no confirmation from the KSC. The fact that the prosecutor has indicted Hashim Thaci is actually less surprising than the manner of the court's announcement. The KSC was set up to examine the allegations in a 2011 Council of Europe report which named Mr Thaci as the leader of a criminal offshoot of the Kosovo Liberation Army involved in drug, gun and human organ trafficking. At the time, Mr Thaci said the Council report contained ""baseless allegations"" and threatened to sue the author, Swiss senator Dick Marty.",Kosovo President Hashim Thaci has been accused of war crimes by a special international prosecutor in The Hague.
"Yusaku Maezawa, who made his money in online retailing, bought seven artworks in total at Christies and Sothebys. His most expensive purchase was for a large piece by Jean-Michel Basquiat for $57.3m, a record for the US artist. Sales to other buyers included a 1968 work by Cy Twombly, which sold at Sotheby's for $36.6m. Mr Maezawa plans to put the art on display in Tokyo, where he lives. Who is Yusaku Maezawa and how is he so rich? Yusaku Maezawa made his money setting up the Start Today company in 1998 and online fashion retailer Zozotown in 2004. The companies made him a billionaire by his mid-30s, and at the age of 40, Forbes magazine listed him as the 17th richest man in Japan with a personal wealth of $2.7bn. What did he buy? His biggest purchase was a large work by Jean-Michel Basquiat entitled Devil's Head, of a devil's head on a red background with bold dark slashes. He said in a statement he ""felt shivers"" when he first saw it. ""Regardless of its condition or sales value, I was driven by the responsibility to acknowledge great art and the need to pass on not only the artwork itself, but also the knowledge of the artist's culture and his way of life to future generations."" He put a picture on Instagram with caption: ""Jean-Michel Basquiat is coming to Japan."" His other purchases over the two auctions were: What will he do with the art? Mr Maezawa is also the founder of the Contemporary Art Foundation in Tokyo, which he says puts on public shows twice a year. He said in a statement he also plans to open a private gallery in his hometown of Chiba. What else was sold? The Sotheby's auction on Wednesday night took a total of $242.2m in sales. Sotheby's said the sale saw the largest ever number of Asian bidders. One of the biggest stars was Twombly's 1968 work Untitled (New York City), which sold for just under $36.7m. Two Studies for a Self-Portrait by figurative painter Francis Bacon was sold for $35m As well as the Basquiat, Christie's on Tuesday night saw Mark Rothko's No 17 sell for $32.6m along with several Calder sculptures.

"Shortly after taking off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Nick Hague and Alexey Ovchinin reported a problem with the rocket's booster. The men were forced into a ""ballistic descent"", with their capsule landing a few hundred miles north of Baikonur. They have been picked up by rescuers. ""The search and recovery teams have reached the Soyuz spacecraft landing site and report that the two crew members... are in good condition and are out of the capsule,"" US space agency Nasa said. Russia said it was suspending any further manned flights, and an investigation into what went wrong had begun. What happened to the rocket? The launch appeared to be going smoothly, but some 90 seconds later Nasa, on its livestream, reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation. Footage from inside the capsule showed the two men being shaken around at the moment that the fault happened. Shortly afterwards, Nasa said they were making a ""ballistic descent"" meaning their capsule descended at a much sharper angle than normal and would have been subjected to greater G-force - the force imposed on a body by rapid acceleration. The capsule separated from the failing rocket and later deployed parachutes to slow its descent. Analysis: An uncomfortable ride back to Earth By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Soyuz is one of the oldest rocket designs but also one of the safest. The malfunction appeared to occur around what is termed ""staging"", where the ascending vehicle goes through the process of discarding its empty fuel segments. The onboard astronauts were certainly aware that something was not right because they reported feeling weightless when they should have felt pushed back in their seats. The escape systems are tested and ready for exactly this sort of eventuality. It would have been an uncomfortable ride back to Earth, however. The crew would have experienced very sharp accelerations and decelerations on the return. There is already much discussion about the current state of Russian industry and its ability to maintain the standards of yesteryear. Whatever the outcome of the inquiry, this event will only heighten those concerns and will underline to the US in particular the need to bring online new rocket systems. These vehicles, produced by the Boeing and SpaceX companies, are set to make their debut next year. How are the crew? They seem to have been unharmed by the experience. Search and rescue teams were quickly on the scene, 500km (310 miles) north-east of Baikonur, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan. They reported that Mr Hague and Mr Ovchinin were alive and well and the Russian civilian space agency, Roscosmos, later issued photos of them having their hearts and blood pressure monitored. ""The emergency rescue system worked, the vessel was able to land in Kazakhstan... the crew are alive,"" Roscosmos tweeted. Nasa described them as being in good condition. They reportedly did not need medical treatment. Nasa added that the two men were being taken to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, and it was ""monitoring the situation carefully"". You might also like to read: What happens now? Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said no further manned missions would take place ""until we believe that the entire situation guarantees safety"". He rejected suggestions it could harm US relations, saying they recognised it was a ""hi-tech industry linked to risk"", but he added: ""We certainly won't conceal the reasons, it is uncommon for such situations"". Space co-operation is an area which has survived otherwise tense relations between Russia and the US. Nasa has been paying for seats on Soyuz rockets to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station since the Space Shuttle programme ended in 2011. The crew already on the ISS will not be affected by Thursday's aborted mission, Russia's Tass news agency reported, quoting an unnamed source as saying they have enough supplies. Have there been similar incidents in the past? Thursday's incident is thought to be the first launch mishap for a Russian Soyuz booster since a Soyuz mission was aborted in 1983. A rocket malfunctioned shortly before launch, and the crew vehicle was ejected to safety. In recent years, Russia's space programme has faced a number of technical failures - 13 since 2010. Last year, contact was lost with a Soyuz rocket's Fregat upper stage, which was carrying a new weather satellite and 18 secondary satellites. Earlier in 2017, at least nine of a payload of 73 satellites were reported ""dead on arrival or severely degraded"" after separation from their Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle. In August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule already docked to the ISS which caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched. In this instance, Russia said the hole may have been drilled ""deliberately"". One of the most serious but non-fatal US incidents involved Apollo 13 - a mission to the Moon in 1970. An oxygen tank exploded two days after launch causing a loss of power and leading to the mission being aborted. The crew were able to carry out repairs and return to Earth six days later. While space missions may often encounter technical difficulties, fatalities have been relatively rare:",A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut were forced to make an emergency landing after their Russian Soyuz rocket malfunctioned en route to the International Space Station (ISS).
"The move follows the leaking of thousands of secret US cables to the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks. An 11-page memo by US intelligence officials detailing the advice has been published by US broadcaster NBC. Correspondents say the Obama administration is trying to prevent more embarrassing disclosures. Agency officials are being urged to find ways to ""detect behavioural changes"" among those employees who might have access to secret documents. The memo suggests the use of psychiatrists and sociologists to measure the ""relative happiness"" of workers or their ""despondence and grumpiness"" as a way to assess their trustworthiness. The document published by NBC has been distributed by Jacob J Lew, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. It was sent this week to senior officials at all agencies using classified material. The US is currently holding soldier Pte Bradley Manning on suspicion of stealing classified documents and passing them to Wikileaks. US officials have not commented on the memo published by NBC. The memo asks: ""Do you have an insider threat programme or the foundation for such a programme?"" It also asks whether agencies are using lie-detector tests or are trying to identify ""unusually high occurrences of foreign travel, contacts or foreign preference"" by members of staff. Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange have faced strong criticism for releasing thousands of cables between the US State Department and diplomatic outposts around the world.","The White House is telling US agencies to create ""insider threat"" programmes to ferret out disgruntled workers who may leak state secrets, reports say."
"Israel has a rate of 11.55 vaccination doses per 100 people, followed by Bahrain at 3.49 and the UK at 1.47, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. In comparison, France had vaccinated 138 people in total by 30 December. More than 1.8m people have now died of the virus around the world. The comparative figures on vaccination are put together by Our World in Data, which is a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity. They measure the number of people who have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Most of the vaccines approved for use so far rely on two doses, given more than a week apart. The US fell far short of its target of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with just 2.78 million having received a jab by 30 December. Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree with UK plans to give as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, while delaying second doses. Dr Fauci said the US would not be adopting a similar strategy. India has meanwhile approved two vaccines for emergency use - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Covaxin vaccine, developed locally by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Two further vaccines are awaiting approval. The country aims to vaccinate 300 million people by the middle of the year and has been staging drills to prepare for mass distribution. How has Israel got so far ahead? Israel began vaccinations on 19 December and is delivering jabs to about 150,000 people a day, with priority given to the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. It secured supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following negotiations early on in the pandemic. It is contacting people with priority access to the vaccine through its health care system - by law all Israelis must register with a recognised health care provider. Israel has safely subdivided shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told YNet TV news. This means smaller batches of the vaccine can be sent out to remote communities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for re-election, has predicted Israel could emerge from the pandemic as early as February. It is currently in its third national lockdown. Why is France lagging behind? In the first three days of its vaccination campaign, which launched on 27 December, France inoculated fewer than 100 people. In comparison, Germany had given more than 190,000 vaccines by Saturday. The EU was slower than the UK or US to authorise any of the vaccines. The European Medicines Agency, the regulator for the 27 EU member states, gave its approval for the Pfizer vaccine on 21 December, compared to 2 December in the UK and 11 December in the US. Part of the difficulty in France stems from the widespread scepticism about the vaccination. In a 15-country poll carried out by Ipsos Global Advisor, just 40% of French respondents said they would be willing to have the vaccine. This compares to 80% in China, 77% in the UK, and 69% in the US. Earlier this week, the French health minister defended the slow pace of vaccinations, saying authorities had chosen to give the jab in care homes to elderly residents, rather than making them travel. However, on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more urgent tone, saying: ""I will not allow an unjustified slowness to set in without good reason."" What is India doing? India is holding a national drill for its vaccination programme, which is aiming to reach 300 million people by the middle of the year. Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said 10 million healthcare workers and 20 million other frontline staff will be prioritised for the jabs. Authorities will initially rely on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been recommended by a government panel. The Oxford jab does not require the same storage at extremely low temperatures as the Pfizer vaccine, making it suitable for distribution to areas without sophisticated health care facilities. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where it is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Another vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech, has been approved for emergency use. Covid-19 has already claimed nearly 150,000 lives in India, with about 10 million people infected - second only to the number infected in the US.","Israel has given vaccinations against coronavirus to more than one million people, the highest rate in the world, as global immunisation efforts step up."
"Mr Salvini pulled the plug on his populist coalition and now wants an urgent confidence vote and elections. The next step will now be decided by a full Senate session on Tuesday. Mr Salvini's ex-coalition partner has accused him of betraying the electorate after 14 months of government. Luigi di Maio's Five Star movement took power with the nationalist League in June 2018, but the relationship has since soured and the League's poll ratings have risen dramatically. The government is headed by an independent prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and a no-confidence vote would bring him down. The Senate will now have to decide whether to call a vote for Wednesday, or wait until 20 August, when Mr Conte would be asked to report to parliament. How soon will elections happen? The League leader may be leading the opinion polls but he does not command a majority in the Senate, so his attempt to force snap elections as early as October may founder. He faces opposition from Mr Di Maio and also the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which was voted out of government last year. Ex-PD leader Matteo Renzi has returned to the political arena with a call to stop Mr Salvini's ""crazy"" push for elections by proposing a caretaker, ""institutional"" government backed by parliament. But Mr Di Maio has refused to work with him, saying ""nobody wants to sit at the table with Renzi"". The Five Star leader Luigi di Maio insists that reform of parliament has to come before elections. He wants to bring down the number of seats in Italy's two chambers of parliament by 345 (out of 945) before new elections. The centre left could in principle allow that to happen. Some Five Star colleagues have indicated they are not averse to forming a coalition with the centre left. ""Having ruled with the League, I think we'd even agree to a deal with Beelzebub,"" leading Five Star official Roberta Lombardi told La Repubblica. Then there is the issue of Italy's budget deficit. The Rome government has until the end of October to submit its 2020 budget to the European Commission. Both Five Star and Matteo Renzi are desperate to avoid an increase in sales tax, which would come into place in January if a budget is not agreed. A League official said on Monday that instead of implementing an increase in sales tax, it would raise Italy's budget deficit to 2.8% of economic output. What is Salvini's next step? To stand any chance of forming a government Mr Salvini would need the support of Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Forza Italia as well as the far-right Brothers of Italy party. Mr Salvini has returned from a campaign tour of beaches in Sicily to rally support in Rome and to meet Mr Berlusconi and Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni. Only the president, currently on holiday on a boat in Sardinia, has the power to dissolve parliament. He has insisted next year's budget has to be approved this autumn, so the window for an election is very small.","The heads of Italy's political groups have failed to reach agreement on when to hold a vote of no confidence, amid a government crisis triggered by nationalist leader Matteo Salvini."
"Donald Tusk was among several leading EU voices to express doubt over Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement plan. The plan would keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods but see it leave the customs union. But what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland remains a central sticking point. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the new plans for the withdrawal agreement were welcome, but ""fall short in a number of aspects"". It comes as UK PM Boris Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, is to hold another round of talks in Brussels in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told European diplomats he still has plenty of questions about the British proposal to replace the backstop - the measure designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. He has said he will be in a better position to judge possible future negotiations with the UK once he has spoken to Mr Frost. On Thursday, Mr Johnson said he had made a ""genuine attempt to bridge the chasm"" with EU officials before time runs out to reach a deal for the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the EU. The UK government says it is aiming to reach a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. EU leaders face a delicate political dance, uncertain if Mr Johnson is open for deeper negotiations or is focusing his attention on a possible election campaign, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Whatever happens, she adds, the EU will be reluctant to be seen slamming the door in the face of the UK. Meanwhile, Scotland's highest civil court is to consider whether Mr Johnson could be jailed if he ignores legislation aimed at preventing no-deal. The so-called Benn Act requires the government to ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline if it fails to either pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve no-deal, by 19 October. However, Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted he would not ask for a delay as the law requires him to, describing the legislation as a ""surrender bill"". What are the proposals? Downing Street hopes its new plan will replace the controversial Irish backstop provision that has proved the biggest obstacle to the existing withdrawal agreement. The backstop was meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but critics - including Mr Johnson - fear it could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson's latest plan seeks to address this with the following: Read more: How does the border plan differ from the backstop? The new UK proposals envisage two borders - one between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and a second between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, says the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler. What do EU officials say about the proposals? EU negotiators say they have already identified problems with the plans, including the continuing failure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and the threat to the single market. Donald Tusk reacted in a tweet, after speaking to Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who is seen as key to agreeing to a withdrawal deal. For his part, Mr Varadkar voiced concerns over the customs proposals, questioning how Northern Ireland and Ireland could operate under different customs systems without the need for physical checkpoints. He also questioned the plan to give Northern Ireland's Assembly a veto over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU, without the involvement of Ireland or the EU. The UK has made some progress but ""further work is needed"", European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said. Accepting the current proposals would not meet the objectives of the backstop including preventing a hard border, he added. Meanwhile, the European parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, called the plans ""unworkable"". In an interview with the BBC, Mr Verhofstadt said the plan represented ""a repackaging of old ideas"". Earlier, the European parliament's Brexit committee said the plan didn't match ""even remotely"" what had already been agreed.","The European Union is ""open but not convinced"" by the UK PM's new proposals for a Brexit deal with the EU, the president of the European Council says."
"Wednesday's decision means human rights violations by the military and rebels during the civil war which ended in 1992 could now be prosecuted. The court declared the law unconstitutional. It said it denied Salvadorans the right to justice and compensation for war crimes. Alleged war crimes, including the murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero and the killing of six Jesuit priests in the 1980s, could now come to court. Rights group Amnesty International said the country could finally deal with its tragic past. However, some Salvadoreans fear the ruling could open old wounds. ""I hope this decision does not turn into a witch hunt,"" said the country's Defence Minister, David Mungia. Both the military and rebel fighters from the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which is now the ruling party, have been accused of atrocities. Many former left-wing rebels have become politicians and lawmakers, including the country's current president, Salvador Sanchez Ceren. It is estimated that more than 75,000 people died and thousands more disappeared during the 1980-92 war.",Rights groups have welcomed a ruling by El Salvador's Supreme Court which struck down an amnesty law approved in 1993.
"Wednesday's strike targeted a vehicle near the town of Khawlan, around 30km (20 miles) from the capital, Sanaa. There have been several US drone strikes against militants in Yemen in recent days. Yemen is considered a stronghold of al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula (AQAP). Militants have gained ground because of the weakness of the central government. A US-backed military offensive last year pushed the militants back from some of its strongholds in the south, but AQAP is viewed by the US as as the most active and deadly wing of al-Qaeda's terror network. Wednesday's strike completely destroyed the car it targeted, with the bodies burnt inside the wreckage, eyewitnesses said. On Tuesday, five people were killed in a strike near the border with Saudi Arabia and on Monday another four people died in a strike in the centre of the country. At least six more are reported to have been killed in strikes over the weekend. Earlier this week, Yemeni human rights minister Huriyah Mashhur was quoted as criticising US drone strikes in Yemen, calling for an ""alternative strategy"".","A US drone strike in Yemen has killed seven suspected al-Qaeda militants, according to Yemeni officials."
"The collision between two light aircraft happened south-east of the city of Tours at about 16:30 local time (15:30 BST) on Saturday. Emergency crew, including about 50 firefighters, were called to the scene. They cordoned off the crash sites. No-one else was harmed when the planes came down. The smaller aircraft, a microlight carrying two people, landed on a fence around a house in the town of Loches, situated about 46km (29 miles) south-east of Tours. A witness told AFP news agency it burst into flames after landing on the house's electricity meter. The larger plane, a Diamond DA40, landed more than a 100m (328ft) away in an uninhabited area. It had three tourists on board. ""All five people involved died,"" local government official Nadia Seghier told AFP. ""Air emergency staff from Lyon were brought in at first to track down the plane, which was quickly found."" There were no immediate details about the identities of the victims or the cause of the collision. Local police have launched an investigation into the incident. The crash sites have been blockaded and residents have been told to stay in their homes, a witness said. Witness Genevieve Allouard-Liebert, who lives in the area, said she had heard a ""big crash"" when the planes came down. She said she and her husband saw a man fall from the larger plane as it skimmed nearby rooftops. Mid-air collisions between small aircraft are considered to be rare. One fatal incident in France happened over Quiberon Bay off the coast of Brittany in 1998, when a Beechcraft 1900D collided in mid-air with a light aircraft, killing 15 people. ""There's never any air traffic around Loches, it's an unlikely and unbelievable accident,"" the town's mayor Marc Angenault said.","Two small planes have collided in mid-air before crashing in western central France, killing five people, local officials say."
"By Secunder KermaniBBC News Now, the family of the poor Christian couple from the central Pakistani town of Gojra hope an end to their ordeal could be in sight; a final hearing at Lahore High Court was scheduled for Wednesday though it was delayed, with a new date due to be announced. Their lawyer, Saif ul Malook, who also represented Asia Bibi, another Christian woman who had a death sentence for blasphemy successfully overturned, told the BBC the evidence used to convict the couple was deeply flawed. But, he warned, that judges can be ""fearful"" of acquitting suspects, in case they are targeted themselves by extremists. Court proceedings have also slowed in recent weeks as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The married couple were convicted in 2014 of sending blasphemous text messages insulting the Prophet Muhammad to a local imam from a phone number registered to Shagufta Kausar's name. Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, and though no-one has ever been executed for it, dozens have been killed by mobs after being accused of the crime. Shagufta's brother Joseph, who requested his surname not be published, told the BBC the couple were innocent, and he doubted they were literate enough even to have written the abusive messages. Shagufta worked as a caretaker in a Christian school, whilst her husband Shafqat is partially paralysed. Joseph said on a visit to jail, Shafqat told him he had been tortured into making a false confession: ""He told me the policeman hit [him] so hard that his leg was broken."" The couple have four children, who Joseph said had been left traumatised. ""All the time they are crying… they are missing them, they wish to see their parents again."" Human rights groups say blasphemy allegations are frequently used to settle personal scores or target religious minorities. The couple's lawyer told the BBC that in their trial they suggested a Christian neighbour they had argued with might have purchased a SIM card in Shagufta Kausar's name and sent the messages in order to frame them. Blasphemy convictions are often eventually overturned on appeal in Pakistan. Last year, Asia Bibi left the country after more than a decade in prison, having been acquitted by the Supreme Court. The verdict led to violent protests by hardline religious groups. Lawyer Saif ul Malook told the BBC he believed the case against Shagufta Kausar and her husband was even weaker than that against Asia Bibi. He said the couple deserved similar support from the international community, and if acquitted, they would also need to be granted asylum abroad. Joseph told the BBC the family's hopes for justice had been boosted by seeing Asia Bibi's release. The Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi warned of the danger of false blasphemy allegations - however, new cases continue to be filed in the country. In April, a woman from the Ahmadi sect, considered heretical in Pakistan, was charged with insulting the Prophet Muhammad during an argument after she attempted to make a donation to a local mosque. Who are Pakistan's Christians? What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?","Shagufta Kausar and her husband Shafqat Emmanuel have spent the last six years in jail waiting for an appeal against their death sentence for ""blasphemy"" to conclude."
"Gavin HewittEurope editor@BBCGavinHewitton Twitter In the UK the main business lobbying organisation the CBI has joined the debate about Britain's future in Europe. Its argument can be summed up as: ""What's good for business is good for Britain."" A lengthy study, according to the CBI's director general John Cridland, came ""to the unequivocal conclusion that British business, large and small, wants to remain within a reformed EU"". The CBI has produced an array of statistics concluding that membership of the EU is worth an extra 4-5% of GDP which translates into £78bn a year for the economy. That is presented as the equivalent of £1,225 per individual or £3,000 per household. The CBI wants to define the choice for the British people as ""in with reform"" or ""out with no influence"". Opening salvos It is a position supported by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and by David Cameron who told the CBI's annual conference that he could secure a ""yes"" vote in a promised referendum. The kind of reforms the CBI would be looking for would include less red tape, removing barriers to e-commerce, and ring-fencing national employment law from EU directives. Despite the CBI's enthusiasm for staying in the EU it does register unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. The CBI's intervention in this debate follows a drum-beat of statements from the business community; the first salvos in a three-year campaign to get the British people to vote ""yes"" to Europe. So we have had Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of financial services industry body TheCityUK saying: ""I do not believe the City's pre-eminent position will survive if we lose our role as Europe's financial capital."" We have had a report entitled Manufacturing: Our future in Europe which concluded that 85% of UK manufacturing firms support EU membership. Other indicators have been more cautious. There was a YouGov survey, published by the campaign group Business for Britain, which reported that - by a majority of 46% to 37% - company bosses believed that the costs of complying with the single market outweighed the benefits of staying in the EU. In October, the think tank Open Europe estimated that the top 100 EU laws cost the UK economy £27.4bn a year. So the battleground is being marked out. It is much less about a fundamental re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. It is more about reforming the EU. It is the road that the rest of Europe is trying to channel the British debate down. Numerous EU leaders have made it clear that Britain will not be able to cherry pick what it likes or dislikes. There will be no tolerance of further British exceptionalism. Senior German officials have been loud and clear; they are open to reforms if they are for all 28 EU members. So David Cameron's emphasis, in recent times, has been on making the EU work better. He tried to make the recent summit about cutting red tape. He came armed with a little booklet explaining how ""sweeping away barriers to growth"" would ""benefit all of Europe"". Closed door The Commission has eagerly supported some of this agenda. They have said that 74% of Europeans believe the EU generates too much red tape. President Barroso has said the EU should be ""big on big things and smaller on small things"". In Brussels it is said that there was ""blood on the wall"" when some regulations were withdrawn by the Commission. There is a message here. The Commission is saying there is flexibility over reviewing legislation on a case-by-case basis to gauge its impact on competitiveness but the door is closed to a fundamental re-negotiation about the competences of the EU. Speaking at the CBI conference, David Cameron said: ""The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It is a long-term strategic choice for Britain: let us reform this organisation. Let us make changes to how it works, and then let's put those changes to the British people in a referendum."" He was clear that EU membership is ""overwhelmingly in Britain's economic interests"". So as the argument about Britain's future in Europe develops it appears less about the repatriation of powers or challenging the commitment to ""ever closer union"" but more about making the EU work more efficiently, with the prime minister being urged to go out and build an alliance for reform. The question is whether this kind of ""reformed"" EU will be enough to convince the British public, whose support for EU membership was described again by the prime minister as ""wafer thin"".","It used to be said, perhaps first by Calvin Coolidge, that: ""What's good for business is good for America."""
"It came after a high court rejected extending pre-arrest bail for him and his sister. They are accused of hiding financial kickbacks in fake accounts. Mr Zardari has previously spent time in jail on corruption charges, but was president from 2008 until 2013. He was elected to office after the assassination of his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Footage on Pakistani media shows members of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) entering his home after the Islamabad High Court's decision. He was seen leaving the residence with his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who is the current chair of the opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Supporters at the address chanted ""long live Bhutto"", in reference to the family's political dynasty, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Zardari has long been considered one of the most controversial figures in Pakistani politics. He spent time in jail in the 1990s and 2000s, and was nicknamed ""Mr 10%"" for the commissions on government contracts he allegedly received. What is Mr Zardari accused of? Investigators say fake bank accounts were used to funnel billions of rupees. Dozens of companies and hundreds of people have been implicated in the scandal, according to Pakistani media reports. Mr Zardari denies wrongdoing in this latest ""fake accounts"" case, which has been under investigation since 2015. He and his sister, lawmaker Faryal Talpur, had their interim bail extended multiple times before Monday's decision. Both attended court earlier on Monday under tight security conditions, but Ms Talpur has not yet been taken into custody. Pakistan's interior minister, Ejaz Shah, told parliament on Monday that the government had no role in Mr Zardari's arrest. A party spokesman has appealed for PPP supporters to remain peaceful. Mr Zardari has only been arrested, not convicted yet, but the move will be a blow for the PPP party he jointly leads and the wider political opposition. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (from the PMLN party) is already in jail having been sentenced in another corruption case in 2018. The current government lead by Prime Minister Imran Khan, were elected on a strident anti-corruption platform, but they will be keen not to be seen as interfering in the case against Mr Zardari. He has always dismissed allegations against him as being politically motivated. Mr Zardari is not a popular figure in Pakistan, and few ordinary people will have much sympathy for him. But there may well be questions about why he has been taken into custody now. Is an element of political vendetta indeed at play, or is this long overdue accountability? They are the same questions that were being asked during the trial of former PM Nawaz Sharif.","Asif Ali Zardari, the former president of Pakistan, has been arrested in Islamabad over a money laundering case."
"The New Year has started off with a bang in Sudan. Civil unrest spread like wildfire across the nation. Protests have raged in cities from Khartoum to Port Sudan, sparked by the removal of subsidies, and other economic measures contained in the 2018 budget. The price of bread and sugar has sky rocketed, the Sudanese pound is in free-fall following its devaluation by the country's central banks and there is a widespread fuel shortage. Security forces have been accused of brute force, with dozens of protestors injured and reports of more than 200 detained. One student in West Darfur, Al-Zubair Ibrahim, was even killed. Despite all of this, one incident has inflamed the popular imagination in Sudan, dominating conversations between family and friends. Videos have circulated of Gasim Bedri - the prominent president of the first all-women university, Al-Ahfad - physically assaulting protesting female students on his campus on 10 January. One particularly shocking video shows the university head walking in front of the demonstrating girls, then suddenly diving into the crowd, grabbing one by her headscarf and repeatedly striking her on the head. The jaw-dropping video spread like wildfire, shared on Whatsapp, Twitter and Facebook and eliciting an astonishing response. While many expressed anger and disapproval of his violent approach, others condoned his actions. Some incorrectly stated that the video was three years old, in an effort to reduce its impact. Some cited Gasim Bedri's illustrious career furthering women's rights and his family's famous legacy of educating and empowering Sudanese women. Others said that he simply had the right to do what he wanted on his campus and that the girls needed to be disciplined. Yousra Elbagir: Some students and parents even argued that the girls were better off being struck by Gasim But even in the midst of these justifications, the most shocking reaction came from his own students - who used terms of fatherly affection and claimed that ""Baba Gasim"" was trying to protect them and was hitting them for their own good. Some students and parents even argued that the girls were better off being struck by Gasim than running riot and facing violent police outside of the campus walls. An overwhelming majority of the university's students and staff have stood firmly in support of his actions. His sister and colleague, well-known feminist activist and gender studies scholar Balghis Bedri, came to his defence. She told BBC Arabic that the tape ""only shows one side of the truth"" and that some of the demonstrators were threatening to burn down university buildings over rising food prices in the campus cafes. After a slew of newspaper interviews in which Mr Bedri used heavily-debated Koranic verses to justify the physical discipline of women, he released an official apology. His statement read: ""I take full responsibility for my actions and I hope there is understanding that my intention was, and will continue to be, to protect my students from any dangers they may face beyond the university's walls."" Infantilised women Sudan's legislation prohibits the physical discipline of girls in the public education system. Ironically, this is the same system where Babiker Bedri, Gasim's grandfather, relentlessly fought for women to have a space. In 1907, he founded the country's first girl's school and one of the earliest in the region. This legacy - one of incredible progress - is not only undermined by the behaviour shown in the video but also by the cracks in its condemnation, both from individuals and the international institutions that support the private university in the name of female empowerment. This incident and the resulting debate has exposed a contradiction at the heart of Sudan's storied history of feminine resistance. That, despite this long and rich history of Sudanese women standing firmly at the forefront of Sudan's epic uprisings, they are still infantilised in the face of untouchable male authority - whether that entails abuse from a police officer or a so-called ""father figure"" and ""protector"".

"By Siavash ArdalanBBC Persian Iran holds crucial presidential elections in June, and hardliners who see the deal as a humiliation want to stall its revival before the polls. The incumbent president, Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate and champion of the deal, cannot stand again following two terms in office. Anti-deal conservatives - already dominant in parliament - hope to replace him with a figure of their own. While in the US opposition to the deal can generally be split along Republican (against) and Democrat (for) lines, in Iran it involves a more complicated political dynamic. This is because of how Iranian public opinion has largely turned against the regime since US sanctions were re-imposed in 2018 after the administration of former President Donald Trump abandoned the deal. Growing discontent On one hand, there are the hardliners who feel that Mr Rouhani's government has been too conciliatory and that a government led by themselves can extract more concessions from the US. This was the strategy behind the passing of a bill in December that reduces even further Iran's nuclear commitments by setting a 22 February deadline for sanctions removal by the US or have Iran bar short-notice inspections of sites by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts. President Rouhani has accused his hardline rivals of wanting to take credit for actually reviving the nuclear deal and even went as far as accusing them of ""wanting Trump to have won US elections"" so it would not happen on his watch. On the other hand, many Iranians are not too excited about any measures that can give a new lease of life to a regime under siege by economic strangulation and whose legitimacy is questioned at home and abroad more than ever. This public discontent has been fuelled by years of crippling US-led sanctions intensified under Donald Trump, which have led to inflation, rising unemployment and unprecedented anti-government street protests - which in turn led to more repression. Many frustrated and disillusioned Iranians have subscribed to the ""regime change"" school of thought advocated by supporters of Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy, though the former US administration never officially endorsed such a move. Pro-Trump sentiments voiced around the time of the US elections by some Iranian academics, political activists and even former officials - from the daughter of ex-President Hashemi Rafsanjani to the adviser of another former President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - continue to be expressed on Iranian social media. Many Iranians may feel that a revival of the nuclear deal will only prolong their hardship by extending to the regime greater international acceptance, and as a result will not bother voting in the June elections. Low turnouts in Iran historically tend to favour hardliners. Iranian hardliners have been branded ""sanction merchants"" by moderates, referring to their vested economic interests in maintaining an underground economy that reaps profits by evading global trading restrictions. Abbas Akundi, a moderate government minister, said such profits amounted to some ""$25bn per annum"". Eyes on Khamenei Enter Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on important foreign policy questions. His views are often considered as close to that of the hardliner faction in the Islamic Republic, although he went along with the agenda of the Rouhani government in striking the nuclear deal with the West. At the same time, he always kept a sceptical distance in the hope of taking credit for its success and denying responsibility for its failure. Understanding Ayatollah Khamenei's calculus can be important in predicting what may happen in the months ahead. Mr Rouhani needs Ayatollah Khamenei's support, which can only be forthcoming if the US is seen as making the first move. For now the immediate problem stopping Iran and the US from going back to the nuclear deal is who initiates the process. However, even a revived deal with all the political theatre that goes with it, may not be enough in itself to convince Iranian voters that go to the polls. For this to happen, they may need to see immediate economic benefits, including a fall in the cost of living, especially in the price of food staples. Hence, the repeated insistence by Iranian diplomats that ""time is running out"".",The window for saving the international nuclear deal with Iran is rapidly narrowing - and a power-struggle inside the Islamic republic between those for and against it could soon seal its fate.
"G-Joey, a yellow trislander, carried out its last flight in June after serving the islands, Southampton and Dinard for nearly 40 years. It had been thought it would do on display in England at the end of its service. ""It's all a bit secret at the moment, Airline Aurigny reported in its Envoyage magazine. ""We hope to tell you where the trislander will be displayed early next year,"" it added. The article said: ""Late in the summer we were approached by a local businessman who expressed a serious interest in displaying Joey under cover, in Guernsey. ""At the time we were discussing a similar option with Southampton's Solent Sky Museum, but, after some very careful thought, we agreed to pursue the local option."" The airline said it would not comment further. Earlier this year the airline had said there had been no official approaches for housing the aircraft in the islands and it was looking for a permanent home in England. More than 5,600 people are part of a Save Joey Facebook group, it has a fan club and the aircraft is the star of seven books. Paul Belben, owner of the Save Joey group, described it as ""fantastic news"". ""Definitely the best decision from Aurigny as regards to Joey's final retirement place. ""It will be interesting to see where this indoor space is, but I'm sure it will be a fitting place.""","A ""secret"" plan will see the Channel Islands' most famous aircraft put on display in the islands."
"Mr Chavez, re-elected in October, had been due to take the oath before the National Assembly on 10 January. The government announced on Tuesday that, as set out in the constitution, he would be sworn in by the Supreme Court at a later date. The opposition, also basing its argument on the constitution, argues that Mr Chavez must be inaugurated on 10 January or step aside. The constitution does not state explicitly what should happen if the ceremony does not take place on 10 January. And political analysts as well as government and opposition figures have differing interpretations. Absolute absence? Some analysts and constitutional experts consulted by the BBC said that if Mr Chavez did not appear on 10 January, it might be necessary to declare his ""absolute absence"" and call elections within 30 days. They argue Mr Chavez's mandate would come to an end without having been formally renewed. Article 233 of the constitution refers to the ""absolute absence"" of a president, meaning he is deemed permanently incapacitated. Some analysts argue that a wide interpretation cannot be placed on this article as it does not expressly refer to the non-appearance of the elected president on the day of the inauguration. Of the conditions listed in Article 233 for ""absolute absence"", the closest to Mr Chavez's condition could be permanent physical disability, which must be declared by the Supreme Court with the approval of the National Assembly; or abandonment of the office of president, which has to be declared by the legislature itself, and which is unlikely. Or temporary absence? Other analysts as well as many members of the opposition are arguing that President Chavez should be declared temporarily incapacitated, according to Article 234. This article, which refers to the first four years of a president's mandate, says the vice-president can take over for up to 180 days. However, the opposition say this does not apply as Mr Chavez's current term ends on 10 January and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, should take over instead as interim leader. This is dismissed by the government. It argues that there exists continuity in Mr Chavez's mandate as he is a re-elected leader. Officials are also citing Article 231, which says that if for any reason, the president cannot be sworn in before the National Assembly, the president can take office before the Supreme Court. Mr Cabello and other members of the government say that the constitution does not specify a time and place for the Supreme Court justices to swear in the president, thus allowing Mr Chavez to be inaugurated at a later date. But some constitutional experts cast doubt on this argument as it appears in the same paragraph that refers to the 10 January (implying it should take place on that day). Elections? Although Mr Cabello says the opposition is using the 10 January as an argument to get rid of Mr Chavez politically, this does not appear to be their intention. In fact, an early presidential election would pose a challenge for the opposition, which suffered heavy election losses last year, both in the presidential and state governorship polls. Moreover, the opposition currently has no official presidential candidate. Henrique Capriles, who lost in October to Mr Chavez but was re-elected governor of the key state of Miranda in December, might be a contender. But some observers believe his presidential defeat has seriously damaged his chances of running as an opposition unity candidate again.",The inauguration of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for a new six-year term has been postponed.
"Col Roy Knight Jr had last seen his family at this same airport 52 years before, when they came to say goodbye before he went to war. The pilot who flew Col Knight's remains home was his son, Bryan, who had last seen his father on that day at age 5. Col Knight flew combat missions almost daily until he was shot down in 1967. His remains were not recovered until more than five decades later. Col Knight was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart and six Air Medals for his actions during the war. On Thursday, his flight home to Dallas aboard a Southwest Airline flight inspired an impromptu moment of silence in the terminal. ""It was a very moving moment,"" said Dallas Love Field airport spokesman Chris Perry. Mr Perry said he had seen veterans' remains flown home before but the response to Mr Knight was ""especially unique"", prompting an unusually large reception. Global News reporter Jackson Proskow detailed the plane's arrival to Dallas Love Field airport, and called witnessing Col Knight's arrival a ""privilege"". Pictures show passengers crowding around the terminal windows, noses pressed up to the glass to watch Col Knight arrive. Employees of Southwest Airlines handed out American flags to everyone at the gate. ""Incredible moment to watch. The entire airport fell silent,"" Mr Proskow wrote. Mr Proskow's tweets generated more than 18 thousand retweets and 40 thousand likes. Many commented on the ""beautiful"" celebration for Col Knight. And several noted his return presented a rare moment of unity in the US, following a pair of mass shootings in Texas and Ohio this week that have shaken the country. ""I think these types of events always bring people together which is always special to see,"" Mr Perry said. Col Knight was born in Garner, Texas in February 1931. He joined the US Air Force just days after his 17th birthday, following five older brothers who all served in World War Two. He was accepted for pilot training in 1957, going on to serve in Germany and France as a fighter pilot. His son Bryan, who flew his father home on Thursday, was born in France during this period, while his father was stationed in Toul-Rosieres. In 1967, Col Knight received orders to serve in south-east Asia and reported to the 602nd Fighter Squadron at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. From there he flew combat missions until being shot down while attacking a target on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. He was initially declared Missing in Action until being declared Killed in Action seven years later. During that time, he was promoted to Colonel. Col Knight's funeral will be held this weekend, with full military honours.",Hundreds of passengers in a Dallas airport took a moment out of their travels to witness the return of a fallen Vietnam War veteran.
"He was found guilty earlier this year of involvement in the assassination. Judges at the Netherlands-based Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) said Salim Ayyash played a central role in the bomb attack in Beirut in 2005 that killed Hariri. They acquitted three other defendants, who like Ayyash were tried in absentia. Hezbollah denied any involvement, and the judges said no evidence implicated the Shia militant group's leaders. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is based in the Netherlands, found Salim Ayyash guilty of murder in absentia. Rafiq Hariri was killed in a suicide blast 15 years ago. What was the case about? Rafik Hariri, a Sunni, was a billionaire businessman who served as prime minister of Lebanon five times following the 1975-90 civil war. His last term in office ended in 2004, after which he aligned himself with the opposition in parliament and backed calls for Syria to withdraw its forces, which had been in Lebanon since 1976. On the morning of 14 February 2005, Hariri was travelling in a motorcade past the St George Hotel in central Beirut when a bomb hidden in a van exploded. The blast created a crater at least 10m (32ft) wide and 2m deep in the street, and left nearby vehicles smouldering and shopfronts blown out and blackened. The killing brought tens of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets in protest against the pro-Syrian government, with the finger of blame for the assassination pointed at Lebanon's heavily influential neighbour. The government resigned two weeks later and Syrian troops pulled out that April. After collecting evidence, the UN and Lebanon set up the STL in 2007 to investigate the bombing, and four suspects were ultimately put on trial in absentia. The prosecution's case relied on the analysis of calls between mobile phones that it said were used to plan, prepare and execute the attack. A Lebanese investigator who started the trawl of the phone data and made crucial early breakthroughs, Wissam Eid, was assassinated in Beirut in 2008.",A member of the militant group Hezbollah has been given five life jail terms in absentia for the assassination of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri.
"The move follows parliamentary elections which the Democratic Party of Socialists won but without an absolute majority 10 days ago. The party has nominated his deputy, Dusko Markovic, to take over. Mr Djukanovic has governed Montenegro either as prime minister or president for most of the past quarter of a century. He had presented the election as a choice between partnership with the European Union or becoming a Russian colony. Since splitting from Serbia in 2006 Montenegro has forged close ties with the EU and Nato, both of which it aims to join. The opposition accuses Mr Djukanovic of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. They deny his claims that they get funding from Moscow. Montenegro profile Montenegro: Nato's newest and last member? Montenegro and Nato: Foes to friends? Mr Djukanovic's resignation was announced by party officials on Wednesday, with no reason given. The nomination of his deputy is expected to be approved by a party committee meeting later in the day. The DPS won the 16 October election but with 36 out of 81 seats, forcing it to seek coalition partners. The poll in the small country of some 630,000 was overshadowed by the arrest of 20 Serbians accused of plotting anti-government attacks. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic at first questioned the timing, but earlier this week said Serbia had detained several people with foreign links accused of spying on Mr Djukanovic. However, he insisted they had ""nothing to do with the Serbian state"", without giving further details. Mr Djukanovic was the youngest prime minister in Europe when he took power in 1991 at the age of 29. He has since served as either prime minister or president for a quarter of a century, bar two interruptions in 2006 and 2010. Many Montenegrins were unhappy that Mr Djukanovic was taking the country into Nato. They remain angry that Nato bombed Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 as part of a strategy to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's then southern province of Kosovo. Montenegro has in recent years seen an influx of Russian money, homebuyers and tourists.","Montenegro's veteran Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic is stepping down, the country's ruling party says."
"He told the judge-led inquiry on Tuesday that the threats had followed his testimony on the previous day. In the earlier testimony, he said he had been the target of assassination attempts in the past. He was forced from office in early 2018 amid widespread allegations of cronyism and abuse of power - which he denies. Mr Zuma was replaced by his then deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, who promised to tackle corruption and described his predecessor's nine years in office as ""wasted"". On Monday Mr Zuma, 77, said the allegations were part of a decades-long ""conspiracy"" to remove him from the political scene. The inquiry is investigating allegations that Mr Zuma oversaw a web of corruption during his term in office. The accusations focus on his relationship with the controversial Gupta family, which was accused of influencing cabinet appointments and winning lucrative state tenders through corruption. Both Mr Zuma and the family deny any wrongdoing. What happened on Tuesday? The inquiry got off to a dramatic start as Mr Zuma told the judge that his personal assistant had received a phone call threatening to kill him and his children. His lawyer was also threatened, Mr Zuma said. Raymond Zondo, the country's deputy chief justice who is chairing the inquiry, said that death threats were ""totally unacceptable"" and it was important to protect witnesses. In his testimony, Mr Zuma emphatically denied that he had discussed cabinet appointments with the Gupta family. ""No, never,"" he said. Zuma on the 'conspiracy' against him ""I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people,"" Mr Zuma told the inquiry on Monday. He lashed out at what he said was a decades-long conspiracy against him. He implied that the UK and US had been - and still were - part of an elaborate plot to discredit him, even as he tried to bring about political and economic change in South Africa. Other foreign trained agents had tried to poison him, Mr Zuma said, without naming them.",South African former President Jacob Zuma says he and his family received death threats after his testimony at an inquiry into corruption under his rule.
"Multiple law enforcement sources tell US media that Fotios ""Freddy"" Geas, 51, and other inmates savagely beat Bulger with a lock inside a sock on Tuesday. The 89-year-old's death came less than 12 hours after he was transferred to a federal prison in West Virginia. Bulger was jailed in 2011 after a 16-year international manhunt. The FBI has launched an investigation into the suspected homicide, and several convicts at the prison have reportedly been placed in solitary confinement for their roles in the attack. Warning: Some readers may find details disturbing Geas's lawyer has described him as a ""stand-up guy"" who loathed informants such as Bulger. Bulger had been an FBI turncoat for years, and used his position to inform on rivals while committing at least 11 murders against his enemies. Unnamed prison officials have told US media that Bulger, who used a wheelchair, was pushed by the inmates into a corner of his cell not in the view of security cameras. But despite their efforts to hide, CCTV cameras captured at least two inmates engaging in the attack that left Bulger bloody and ""unrecognisable"", according to the New York Times. Officials say a metal padlock tucked into a sock - known in prisons as a ""lock-in-the-sock"" - was wielded like a mace during the attack. According to several reports, Bulger's eyes had been gouged out, or possibly detached from his skull due to the force of the beating he received. His tongue also may have been cut out, several US outlets have reported. The FBI has so far refused to comment on Bulger's death. Suspect 'hated informants' Daniel D Kelly, a lawyer who has represented Geas for years, told the Times that the convicted New England hitman ""has a particular distaste for co-operators"". He added that Geas' feelings were so strong that during his trial for the 2003 murder of the leader of the Genovese crime family in Springfield, Massachusetts, he rejected a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid a life sentence. His father told NBC News that he does not believe his son committed the attack. ""That's not his type of thing to do,"" said Fotios Geas Sr. On Tuesday, Bulger's attorney JW Carney Jr blamed the government for failing to protect his client, saying Bulger ""was sentenced to life in prison, but as a result of decisions by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, that sentence has been changed to the death penalty"". A former Boston police official told the Times that he could not understand why prison guards had not kept Bulger ""away from a convicted organised crime hit man from Massachusetts"". ""I'm not surprised that he got hit; I'm surprised that they let him get hit,"" said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner. Bulger's victims celebrate Meanwhile, the families of Bulger's victims have not tried to hide their celebrations. ""He died the way I hoped he always was going to die,"" Steven Davis, the brother of Debra Davis who Bulger is said to have strangled to death, told the Boston Globe. Tommy Donahue, whose father was killed by Bulger, told WFXT-TV that he was ""overwhelmed with joy"" at the news. His mother, Patricia Donahue, said she planned to ""open up a champagne bottle and celebrate"". ""The guy that did this, I would go put money in his canteen account,"" Mr Donahue told Boston 25 News.","A convicted mafia hitman serving a life sentence for murder is reportedly the prime suspect in the killing of Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger."
"Many countries have been in lockdown since at least March, but some are beginning to ease restrictions. That must be done carefully, the World Health Organization warns, otherwise it risks a resurgence of infections. Nonetheless, billions remain largely at home, and many are struggling with the economic and social consequences. In Syria, churches and mosques in government-held areas are permitted to open again after being closed for almost two months. The government has confirmed 47 cases of coronavirus in the country. India remains in lockdown, first introduced on 24 March, but some restrictions have been eased. Around 122 million are believed to have lost their jobs in April, and many say they will starve if they cannot work. Italy now has a recorded death toll of more than 30,000 but the rate of infection has dropped. That has led the government to enter Phase 2 of its response, including allowing people to exercise more outdoors and travel in their region. Restrictions were eased in Jordan in late March but an outbreak in Mafraq province led the government to introduce a 24-curfew on Friday and seal off some villages. In Poland, hotels, shops, shopping centres, museums and galleries reopened on 4 May, with one customer per 15 sq m of space allowed. The country has 15,000 infections and 700 deaths - less than many Western European countries. Spain has a four-stage plan to roll back one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. From Monday customers can order a beer on a terrace bar. But Madrid and Barcelona, epicentres of the outbreak, are excluded for now. France will be divided into zones, with restrictions eased in most of the country from 11 May - though tight lockdown measures remain in Paris and in the north-east. In Mexico quarantine measures are still in place but the large car industry could be allowed to open again on 18 May. Many Mexicans are celebrating a muted Mother's Day, with musicians recording concerts online. And South Africans have entered their 44th day of lockdown, which has yet to be eased. The country has more than 9,000 confirmed cases, the highest in Africa. .","Coronavirus has now infected more than four million people globally, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University."
"The country now has the second-largest number of confirmed cases in the world, 4,204,613. It has reported 71,642 deaths, the third-highest in the world. The surge in reported infections has mostly come from five states. The rise comes as the government continues to lift restrictions to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. For the last seven days India's caseload has galloped, adding more than 75,000 daily infections per day. More than 60% of the active cases are coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Cases have also begun spiking in the capital, Delhi, as well, with more than 3,200 infections recorded on Sunday, the city's highest in more than two months. An upsurge of Covid-19 in many rural areas has also led to an uptick in numbers. The virus has struck a remote tribe in India's Andamans islands, with 10 members of the Greater Andamanese testing positive over the past month. The rise in cases is also partly a reflection of increased testing - the number of daily tests conducted across the country has risen to more than a million. Although India has a low death rate from the disease, nearly 1,000 deaths have been recorded every day from across the country for the last seven days. In early August India became the third country in the world to pass two million cases. India went into a stringent lockdown in March in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, whose numbers were only in the hundreds then. It began to ease out of it in phases in June to promote economic activity, even as cases continued to spike. The pandemic and the lockdown caused massive disruptions to economic activity during the quarter. India's economy shrank by 23.9% in the three months to the end of June, the worst slump since the country started releasing quarterly data in 1996.","India has recorded more than 90,000 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking its total above that of Brazil."
"Rajesh Tiwari, 42, has developed a serious phobia of any screen which is bigger than his mobile phone. He thinks big screens, especially TV sets and computer monitors, are giant creatures who can attack him. Mr Tiwari began experiencing hallucinations after a long stay in an intensive care unit. In early June he had tested positive for coronavirus and he was admitted to a private hospital as his condition worsened. Five days later he was put on a ventilator. Mr Tiwari recovered after nearly three weeks in the hospital. But he soon realised that his recovery was not complete. ""I am better now because I sought treatment, but the first few weeks after my discharge from the hospital were very difficult,"" he said in an interview. Mr Tiwari's family was elated to bring him home, but after a while they realised that everything was not right with him. One day, he screamed at the TV set and attempted to smash it. The family had to stop watching TV and nobody was allowed to use laptops at home. Mr Tiwari said he was struggling to forget the images of monitors constantly beeping and flashing numbers in the ICU. Amit Sharma and his family had a similar experience. Mr Sharma, 49, spent 18 days in the ICU and saw people die every day. Young and old, men and women - all kinds of Covid-19 patients were dying around him. ""One day, two patients around me died and their bodies were there for several hours,"" he said. ""I just can't get those images out of my head. I still fear Covid might kill me."" Mr Sharma is struggling to forget the traumatic experience. He became very quiet at home after his recovery, his uncle said. ""And whenever he talked, it was always about the patients he had seen dying in the Covid ward,"" he said. Many recovering coronavirus patients in India are experiencing mental health distress, said Dr Vasant Mundra, a senior psychiatrist at Mumbai's PD Hinduja hospital, particularly those who were on a ventilator or spent a long time in an ICU. ""The brain is already exhausted by the time you get to the hospital. And then the mayhem of the Covid wards overwhelms your senses,"" Dr Mundra said. Covid-19 patients are not allowed to meet family and they don't get to see the faces of their doctors and nurses, who are wearing protective masks at all times. That was disrupting patients' ability to form trust with their doctor, said Dr A Fathahudeen, the head of the critical care department at Ernakulam Medical College in southern India, in turn disrupting their recovery. Recovery from coronavirus can be a lonely experience, and doctors say when a patient experiences life threatening events as well the chance of post traumatic stress drastically increases. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and hallucinations, Dr Mundra said. And yet, mental health issues associated with coronavirus patients are not getting enough attention, doctors warn. There are few mentions in government press conferences or in the media. Prominent mental health expert Dr Soumitra Pathare said he was not surprised. ""What you are seeing during the pandemic is a reflection of India's poor investment in mental health facilities,"" he said. India lacks facilities and experts to treat mental health patients, and the situation is worse in smaller towns where people are often not able even to recognise symptoms. Much of India's mental health treatment infrastructure is concentrated in cities, leaving 80%-90% of the population with little or no access to mental health specialists, said Dr Pathare - adding that the gap is becoming clearer during the pandemic. If the government failed to recognise and address the problem soon India would be facing a ""mental health pandemic"", he said. A good starting point would be making people more aware of symptoms, Dr Pathare said. And the next step would be to improve mental health facilities, especially in smaller towns. ""I am aware it won't happen overnight, but we have to start somewhere,"" he said. Kamna Chhibber, the head of the mental health department at Fortis hospital in Delhi, said she had witnessed a sharp rise in the number of people reaching out for help during the pandemic. A long lockdown, uncertainty over the future, and the need to be constantly alert had made people more anxious, and more people were coming to the hospital to talk generally about anxiety and depression, Ms Chhibber said. The problem was becoming ""more serious with each passing day"", she said. Doctors are now urging for mental health to be addressed as part of post-Covid treatment protocols. Each hospital needed to do something, said Dr Fathahudeen, or ""we may save people from Covid but lose them to depression and PTSD"". The names of the patients have been changed to protect their identities.","In India, relentlessly rising case numbers are causing another emergency - serious mental health problems among Covid-19 patients, writes the BBC's Vikas Pandey."
"Denisovan remains were discovered in 2008 and human evolution experts have become fascinated with the group that went extinct around 50,000 years ago. One of the biggest questions had been over their appearance, with no full sketches of the Denisovan drawn up. But now a team of researchers have produced reconstructions of our long-lost relatives. Who were the Denisovans? Around 100,000 years ago there were several different groups of humans including modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. ""In many ways, Denisovans resembled Neanderthals but in some traits they resembled us and in others they were unique,"" said Prof Liran Carmel, a researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Denisovans are thought to have been based in Siberia and eastern Asia. Scientists have found evidence that the Denisovans lived at high altitudes in Tibet, passing on a gene that helps modern people cope at similar elevations. It is not yet known why they disappeared. They only came to the attention of the world after archaeologists investigated remains in a cave in Siberia little over a decade ago. So far, the only Denisovan remains discovered are three teeth, a pinky bone and a lower jaw. About 5% of the ancestry of people from Oceania can be traced to Denisovans, according to studies. What do the new reconstructions tell us? The reconstructions - based on complex DNA analysis of Denisovans, Neanderthals, Chimpanzees and humans - show that the Denisovan skull was probably wider than that of us or Neanderthals. They also appeared to have no chin. The experts predict many Denisovan traits that are similar to that of Neanderthals including a sloping forehead, long face and large pelvis, and others that are unique among humans, like a large dental arch. Prof Carmel told the BBC he was delighted to find that some of their predictions had been confirmed by the discovery of a Denisovan jawbone by separate researchers. ""The jawbone was reported and we were very excited to see how it matched. It was kind of an independent confirmation of our method,"" he said. The reconstructions were just the start in Denisovan research, Prof Carmel said. ""They were humans very similar to us so pointing out the differences between us is critical to understand what makes us human and what might have led to the way we adapted to the world,"" he said.",Researchers have provided the first glimpse of what an ancient group of humans looked like.
"His discretion and diplomacy, and his preference for working behind the scenes have earned him the respect of those in Italy and beyond. His seven-year term in office had been due to end on 15 May, but inconclusive elections in February have left Italy in political deadlock, governed by a caretaker cabinet. After parliament had made five failed attempts to elect a new president, leaders of the main political parties appealed to the 87-year-old leader to put forward his candidacy and he agreed to seek re-election. The leaders - both on the left and right - expressed their concern over a deepening political and economic crisis, describing the situation as ""grim"" and urging parliament to ""show unity"" in re-electing Mr Napolitano. 'Examine your consciences' Although, the role of the president in Italy is often seen as largely ceremonial, holders of the office are listened to carefully if they intervene. ""I cannot shun my responsibility towards the nation,"" was Mr Napolitano's response to the cross-party plea to run for the office again. The remarks were a turnaround for a man who for weeks had maintained he was too old to remain in office. Two years ago - as attention began to turn to Italy as the next state potentially to be engulfed by the eurozone crisis - Mr Napolitano also spoke out. He then urged a ""collective examination of conscience"" in what seemed a not-so-coded message to a political class often more concerned with its own survival than that of the country. ""There is much that has to change in the behaviour of all those involved in public and social life. ""The institutions of the European Union, and the states that belong to this union, each and every one, are paying the price of our failures, hesitations and contradictions. We should each ask ourselves how personally responsible we are,"" he added. His strong sense of pride in Italy, and of the importance of principles in public life, led him to embrace the role of president, distant from the often treacherous world of Italian parliamentary politics. But it was a sphere he knew well, being elected to the Italian parliament in 1953 at the age of 28, and remaining for 10 consecutive legislatures. He became speaker of the lower house between 1992 and 1994, and was appointed interior minister in Romano Prodi's government between 1996 and 1998. For five years until 2004, he was a member of the European parliament, serving as chairman of its committee on constitutional affairs. 'Fair-minded' Born in Naples, he is reported to have become involved with Italy's resistance movement during the German occupation, taking over a magazine and publishing texts by Karl Marx disguised as editorials penned by young writers. He began his political career in Italy's now-defunct Communist party but was described as ""the least communist Communist that the party has ever enlisted,"" according to La Stampa newspaper. Always reform-minded, he was among the leading architects of the party's transformation into a social-democratic movement, seeking dialogue with Italian and European socialists to end his party's isolation and supporting European integration. When he was appointed president, Richard Gardner, US ambassador to Italy between 1977 and 1981, sought to reassure the administration of George Bush that he would be an ally. ""He's a real statesman, he's fair-minded, he's a true believer in democracy, a friend of the United States and he will carry out his office with impartiality and fairness,"" Mr Gardner, who had held meetings with Mr Napolitano during his time in Rome, told the Associated Press. In February this year, Pope Benedict XVI was said to have confided in Mr Napolitano a week before he announced his resignation, an example of the apparent bond the two men shared. On the domestic front, Mr Napolitano clashed with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi over the issue of the right-to-die. In 2009, he refused to sign an emergency decree issued by Mr Berlusconi that would have overturned the judgment of several courts and forced the parents of a 32-year-old woman who had been in a coma for 17 years to continue to treat her. But these moments of controversy have been rare, which may go some way to explain his political longevity, and his personal popularity - qualities much-needed as Italy faces the deepest of crises.","Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, re-elected on Saturday for an unprecedented second term in office, is known as a measured, mild and immaculately-mannered politician."
"Fifteen were injured when the suspect, named by police as Santino William Legan, 19, opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday evening. Police say the suspect used an assault rifle that he purchased legally in neighbouring Nevada this month. The gunman was shot dead by police, who are looking into a possible accomplice. Six-year-old Stephen Romero is the first of the dead to be identified by local media. His mother and grandmother were wounded. Police confirmed a man in his 20s was also killed. None of the victims have been officially named. At least 15 people were transported to hospital, according to officials from the four hospitals where victims were brought. At least 12 were treated for gunshot wounds, according to health officials. Gilroy police chief Scott Smithee said during a news conference on Monday that the officers who were deployed at the event were able to respond within a minute. He said three officers engaged the suspect and, although they were ""outgunned with their handguns against a rifle"", they managed to fatally wound him quickly and end the shooting. ""I can't tell you how proud I am at the officers for being able to engage this guy as quickly as they did because we had thousands of people there in a very small area, and you know it could've gotten so much worse so fast,"" Mr Smithee said. ""It seems like this was a random act,"" said Chief Smithee, with his voice cracking with emotion. When asked about reports of a possible accomplice and whether that was true, he responded: ""We just don't know."" FBI Agent in Charge Craig Fair told reporters that the priority for investigators was to try to determine motivation, ideological leaning and whether the attacker was affiliated with any group. He said it would take time for the ""expansive"" crime scene to be investigated. Legan's home in Gilroy - only about one mile from the shooting scene - was being searched late on Sunday and into Monday morning. It remains unclear whether he was targeting people individually or firing at random. Before the shooting, Legan had posted about the festival on Instagram, US media reported, saying: ""Ayyy garlic festival time come get wasted on overpriced [expletive]"". His account has since been deleted, but in another previous post he had reportedly referenced racist ideologies. The lead guitarist of the group TinMan, which was performing on stage when the attack began, said he heard someone ask the shooter: ""Why are you doing this?"" Jack Vanbreen told the Associated Press he heard the assailant respond: ""Because I'm really angry"". On Sunday, police said the attacker had cut through a fence surrounding the event, which takes place 30 miles (48km) south of San Jose and attracts 100,000 people each year. Alberto Romero, the father of six-year-old victim Stephen Romero, told Mercury News that he was at home with his nine-year-old daughter when he got the panicked call from his wife. They had been playing in an inflatable bounce house at the time of the attack, she told him, when the boy was shot in the back. ""I couldn't believe what was happening, that what she was saying was a lie, that maybe I was dreaming,"" said Mr Romero. ""He was joyful, always wanted to play, always positive,"" he said, adding that the boy's mother has been placed in a medically induced coma after being shot in the stomach and her mother was being treated for a gunshot wound in the leg. It was the 246th mass shooting in the US this year, according to US tracking website Gun Violence Archive. At the White House on Monday, US President Donald Trump thanked the police ""who swiftly killed the shooter"". He called the attacker ""a wicked murderer"" and vowed that the US would grieve for the families of victims and ""ask that God comfort them"".","A six-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl were among the three people killed in a shooting at a food festival in California, police have confirmed."
"Relations between the UK and Russia have been strained since the Russian dissident's death in London in 2006. The UK prime minister said in Moscow, during the first talks there by a UK leader since 2005, that the UK would continue to challenge Russia's refusal to extradite the prime suspect. But he said his one-day trip had improved trade links. Here, readers in Russia and the UK discuss the importance of the visit and current relations between the two countries. Ross Hunter, 57, English school head, Moscow I was lucky enough to be in the lecture [given by David Cameron at Moscow State University] this morning. It was pleasantly bland - the real work of diplomacy can only happen without an audience. David Cameron was right to mention Litvinenko. It is a disgrace that he was murdered on British soil. But whether it was the Russian state is another question. Our PM was right to warn of the deteriorating business environment, where the courts here serve the highest bidder, or the state. There are business opportunities for both countries in working closer together. Russia is not finding it easy to move away from its economic dependency on oil and gas. Don't forget that Russian and British people get on very well, irrespective of whether their governments are on good terms or not. We share a great sense of irony and mistrust of government. Every time our leaders argue, the Russian people feel closer to the British. Gregory, scientist, 48, London David Cameron should not try to compromise with the Russian government. He should demand that Russia develops basic elements of democracy - such as freedom of speech - before improving ties. I'm a Russian who has lived in the UK for 12 years. I'm devastated by the current state of my motherland. Corruption is everywhere, it is not even hidden. I think the future is potentially even more bleak. I fear there will be less democracy - less actual elections and they will mean less. The elite don't invest back in society and so living standards could decline and inequality increase. I understand why Cameron is trying to push British business in Russia, but I think it is impossible for British businesses to flourish there because of corruption. The Russian elite desperately need Western recognition to move their assets and relatives abroad in case those elite change. Do not give them an easy ride. Valentina Antipov, 47, business consultant, Hitchin, Herts My family is from a long line of emigrants from Russia and I have lived in Britain since finishing university. The main issue with Russia is that the powers at the top do not represent the personality and desires of the vast majority of the population. Since communism, the Russian government has been arrogant and too willing to cut off its nose to spite its face. The Russian people have long since got used to the idea that their history is plagued by dictators, much like we see in China, and South East Asia. There is a saying in Russia now: ""There is nothing wrong in Russia, apart from its roads and leaders."" Cameron has showed he's not afraid to discuss Litvinenko and this is the right attitude. I am particularly glad that he boldly followed his agenda. Again, Cameron was right in saying that there are areas where UK and Russia could work together well, with mutual gain. However, Russia with its natural resources, traditionally feels indestructible and capable to sustain itself. At its core it doesn't feel that it needs help from others. Gennady, Saratov, Russia It would be in the interests of both countries to overcome legal issues and improve co-operation between the two. Russia needs the UK. All it wants is a little bit more understanding. In the whole, Russians deeply appreciate British culture, science and technology. The UK has a lot to share - and to sell.","David Cameron has rejected a call by Russia to restore links with its security services, which were frozen after the Alexander Litvinenko murder."
"By Ashitha NageshBBC News From January 2017 until December 2018, 2,000 unemployed Finns got a monthly flat payment of €560 (£490; $634). The aim was to see if a guaranteed safety net would help people find jobs, and support them if they had to take insecure gig economy work. While employment levels did not improve, participants said they felt happier and less stressed. When it launched the pilot scheme back in 2017, Finland became the first European country to test out the idea of an unconditional basic income. It was run by the Social Insurance Institution (Kela), a Finnish government agency, and involved 2,000 randomly-selected people on unemployment benefits. It immediately attracted international interest - but these results have now raised questions about the effectiveness of such schemes. What is 'basic income' and how does it work? Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means. The Finnish trial was a bit different, as it focused on people who were unemployed. Another popular variation is 'universal basic services' - where instead of getting an income, things like education, healthcare and transport are free for all. Although it's enjoying a resurgence in popularity, the idea isn't new. In fact, it was first described in Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516 - a full 503 years ago. Such schemes are being trialled all over the world. Adults in a village in western Kenya are being given $22 a month for 12 years, until 2028, while the Italian government is working on introducing a ""citizens' income"". The city of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, is also carrying out a basic income study called Weten Wat Werkt - ""Know What Works"" - until October. What is the point? Supporters of basic income often believe an unconditional safety net can help people out of poverty, by giving them the time to apply for jobs or learn essential new skills. This is seen as increasingly important in the age of automation - that is, put very simply, as robots take people's jobs. Miska Simanainen, one of the Kela researchers behind the Finnish study, tells BBC News that this was what their government had wanted to test, in order ""to see if it would be a way of reforming the social security system"". So, did it work? That depends what you mean by 'work'. Did it help unemployed people in Finland find jobs, as the centre-right Finnish government had hoped? No, not really. Mr Simanainen says that while some individuals found work, they were no more likely to do so than a control group of people who weren't given the money. They are still trying to work out exactly why this is, for the final report that will be published in 2020. But for many people, the original goal of getting people into work was flawed to begin with. If instead the aim were to make people generally happier, the scheme would have been considered a triumph. One participant, former newspaper editor Tuomas, pretty much summed this up when he told BBC News about how the basic income had affected him. ""I am still without a job,"" he explained. ""I can't say that the basic income has changed a lot in my life. OK, psychologically yes, but financially - not so much."" What are the downsides to basic income? UBI is one of those rare issues that attracts equally strong support - and criticism - from all parts of the political spectrum. For a lot of people on the left, UBI focuses too heavily on individuals' personal wealth and buying power - or rather, their lack of it - without doing anything to stop companies wasting resources by producing far more stuff than people need, and over-working their employees in the process. Economics writer Grace Blakely makes this point in the New Socialist, adding that ""without fundamental structural reforms to our economic system, UBI will only be a sticking plaster papering over the cracks"". Others worry that basic income will be used to cut costs, by setting the rate too low and slashing other, means-tested benefits. Meanwhile, many on the political right and centre worry about the exact opposite - that UBI would be too expensive to implement, and would encourage a ""something for nothing"" culture. Ulrich Spiesshofer, chief executive of ABB engineering company, echoed this sentiment in 2016 when he told the Financial Times that ""economic rewards [for people] should be based on actually creating economic value"". So what next? Researchers from Kela are now busy analysing all of their results, to figure out what else - if anything - they can tell us about basic income's uses and shortcomings. Mr Simanainen says that he doesn't like to think of the trial as having ""failed"". From his point of view, ""this is not a failure or success - it is a fact, and [gives us] new information that we did not have before this experiment"".","Giving jobless people in Finland a basic income for two years did not lead them to find work, researchers said."
"By Rob WalkerBBC News, Madre de Dios Manuel Kameno reaches into the undergrowth and plucks out a bright green leaf. ""This one is good for back pain,"" he says. A bit further on, he swoops down again and picks a stem with a fragile yellow flower on top. ""For toothache,"" he says, and marches further into the forest. Mr Kameno, who is well into his seventies, is a walking encyclopedia of the amazing variety of plants and animals in the Peruvian Amazon, one of the most bio-diverse rainforests in the world. But all this is changing before his eyes. Peru's south-eastern Madre de Dios region is in the grip of a frantic and lawless gold rush. Record prices on international gold markets have attracted tens of thousands of migrants from across Peru, overwhelming the existing informal mining sector. Illegal miners now operate right on the border of Kameno's indigenous community, the Amarakaeri. ""Since mining started with machines, the gold miners have made holes in the forest. So the animals have run and gone to other places. Our fear is that the forest will disappear,"" Mr Kameno says. Further up the mighty Madre de Dios river, the reason for his concern becomes clear. Huepetuhe is one of oldest mining areas in the region. It looks as though the skin of the earth has been peeled back. Earth-movers pick unceasingly at the carcass. Walter Baca takes me on a tour of his goldmine. Clad in a pair of shorts and Wellington boots, he proudly shows me how it all works. Truckloads of earth are dumped down a steep metal chute and mixed with water. At the bottom, muddy fluid spews out over mats designed to catch particles of gold dust. By the end of a 10-hour shift, Mr Baca and his team of a dozen miners have collected about 40g of gold. ""In the last few years, there has been gold fever here because back in 1999 gold was worth just 27 soles a gram. Last year, there were days when it was worth 145 soles (about $55),"" he says. People continue to arrive from Peru's poverty-stricken highlands to seek their fortune. The government believes that anywhere up to 50,000 small-scale miners are now active in the Madre de Dios region. Almost all operate outside the law, without government permits and with little concern for the environment. Deforestation is not the only problem. Miners use mercury to process the gold dust, which then pollutes the rivers and the food chain. The president of Madre de Dios regional government, Jose Luis Aguirre, is frank about the scale of the problem: ""It's almost like it has kidnapped us in our own homes. I have had death threats myself from illegal miners."" But the administration of President Ollanta Humala, elected last year, is now acting, he says. New decrees issued in February set out tougher penalties for illegal mining. ""The police have been using dynamite to blow up the mining pumps because that is the only way of making sure they are completely destroyed,"" says Mr Aguirre. The government is aiming to clear all illegal miners from areas bordering the national parks, and several thousands have so far been removed. People operating in areas where mining is not prohibited can continue as long as they legalise their activities by getting proper title to land, obeying environmental regulations and paying tax. But that has provoked a fierce dispute between the miners and the government. Corruption Some miners say that, in practice, government corruption and bureaucracy make it impossible to legalise their work. ""I handed in my environmental assessment to the Mining Ministry four years ago and it's still sitting there. They still haven't even evaluated it,"" says Mr Baca. Mr Aguirre accepts that corruption is a serious problem. ""The weight of gold buys many consciences. I know there are people involved in corruption, here in the regional government. We have found that there are public prosecutors who even own their own mining dredges."" Mr Aguirre says he cannot sack these officials because they are employed by the national rather than the regional government. In the past, corruption and government incompetence have scuppered efforts to control illegal mining in Madre de Dios. But the central government, indicating a determination to act, has sent more staff to bolster the regional mining ministry. It has given miners until March next year to either start operating legally or stop mining. But there is strong resistance. Thousands of miners took to the streets of the regional capital, Puerto Maldonado, in March to oppose the government's reforms. Three were killed in clashes with police. 'Coffins and body bags' More confrontation appears to be looming. Luis Otsuka, the head of Fedemin, the local miners federation, is adamant that his members will not accept the government's reforms. ""I am telling the central government to bring coffins and body bags here because they won't just be taking dead miners away, they'll also be taking police and their soldiers. We will never let them steal our work from us."" Mining is a sensitive issue for President Humala, who was elected on the promise of ensuring poor Peruvians got a fairer share of the country's natural resources. But Fedemin accuses the government of targeting small-scale miners while doing business with foreign mining corporations that have multi-billion dollar operations in other parts of the country. The government in turn argues that powerful miners' leaders oppose reform simply because they stand to lose huge revenues if they are forced to become registered, taxed and regulated. The outcome of this stand off will depend partly on whether President Humala - unlike his predecessors - sustains his crackdown in the face of likely future protests. But it will also depend on events further away. The rate of increase in illegal gold mining has been determined largely by the global gold price. That, more than anything, may dictate the speed with which the forest is cut down to make way for gold mines. You can listen to Rob Walker's report from the Peruvian Amazon on Assignment on the BBC World Service. The documentary will be broadcast from Thursday 12 July 2012","Tens of thousands of Peruvians have flocked to the country's Amazon region to join a chaotic gold rush. But illegal mining has led to violence, pollution and the destruction of parts of the country's precious rainforest. Can new government measures to control the miners succeed?"
"The measure will appear on November's ballot after more than 500,000 people signed up to back the proposal. The measure would see death row inmates have their sentences commuted to life. Just 13 people have been executed since the law was re-introduced in 1978. Backers say abolition could save California $100m (£62m) per year, but opponents say justice would be harmed. ""Our system is broken, expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake,"" said Jeanne Woodford, a former warden of San Quentin Prison, home to the largest death row unit in the US. Ms Woodford is now an anti-death penalty advocate and is named as the official proposer of the measure, which is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Ms Woodford and other supporters say the cash savings would be achieved by taking prisoners off death row and by cutting down on fees for lawyers arguing death penalty cases. The money could be better spent investigating unsolved crimes, backers of the measure say. Under the terms of the measure those sentenced to life in prison for murder would in future have to take up jobs while incarcerated. 'Political points' With the state of California wracked by long-standing budget issues, there is wide acceptance that the death penalty system needs reform. Data from the Death Penalty Information Center shows that at the start of the year the state had 723 inmates on death row. The US as a whole had 3,189. But no inmate has been put to death in California since 2006, and a respected study in 2009 noted that the state was spending some $184m each year to keep death row and the death penalty infrastructure up and running. Opponents of the measure argue that the principle of the death penalty is valid and should remain, but say the constant and costly appeals and legal fees are inflating the costs. ""On behalf of crime victims and their loved ones who have suffered at the hands of California's most violent criminals, we are disappointed that the ACLU and their allies would seek to score political points in their continued efforts to override the will of the people and repeal the death penalty,"" former Sacramento prosecutor McGregor Scott told the Associated Press. The death penalty measure is the fifth to qualify for November's ballot, California's secretary of state said on Monday. Other measures deal with water costs, political contributions, car insurance and local legislative boundaries.",Voters in California are to be asked whether they want to abolish the state's death penalty law.
"By Muhammad Jameel Yusha'uNorthumbria University It will also be a relief for the government of President Goodluck Jonathan that faced the strongest resistance from the Nigerian public since he took charge of the country. It is equally a relief for the international community, who must have been concerned by the threat issued by the unions to shut down oil production - a threat that contributed to the surge in prices in the oil market. But the most critical question is: Who won the battle between the Nigerian government and the unions representing the public? I suggest that the people have won. They have won because the president had said the new price was not negotiable. The president had to backtrack, otherwise the unions would have undermined his authority. Young Nigerians were already talking about the ""Nigerian Spring"" on social networking sites such as Twitter, using the hashtag #OccupyNigeria. Many of the critics of the subsidy are aware of the corruption associated with it - they know that a few individuals use the subsidy to milk the Nigerian treasury and amass enormous wealth. The mass protests are not necessarily about subsidy removal, they are about the deficit of trust in government. Restoring that trust is the mountain President Jonathan now has to climb. Jonathan's dilemma He must make a decision on who makes the final call in running the Nigerian government. Since the return of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as finance minister - with the additional title of coordinating minister for the economy - a title just short of being prime minister - she has become the most powerful unelected politician in the country. Mrs Okonjo-Iweala is a professional who rose to the position of managing director at the World Bank. But despite her qualifications, Nigerians have reservations about her economic management. In 2005 she led the effort for debt relief, under which Nigeria repaid $12bn to leave itself virtually debt-free. She promised Nigerians that the money saved would now be channelled into re-invigorating Nigerian health care, construction of roads, etc.. None of that happened. Yet she led the debate once again on the removal of subsidy by preaching the same old song of using the money saved on maternal mortality and electricity generation. The International Monetary Fund is the leading organisation asking African countries to remove the subsidy. The fuel subsidy has been removed in Ghana, and Uganda has also removed part of the subsidy on electricity. This is where President Jonathan has a dilemma. The international community partly contributed to his stability in office because they were aware of the irregularities in the election that put him there, despite the claim by Nigerian officials that the election was free and fair. European countries and the United States supported Mr Jonathan partly because of the politics of oil, because Nigeria is major supplier of oil to Europe and the US. Political microscope The strike led by Nigeria's unions has left President Jonathan in a weaker position, and international organisations like the IMF will be partly disappointed with him, but the pressure within Nigeria will be reduced. At least he can focus on the security challenges facing the country as a result of ethno-political and pseudo-religious crises. To avoid falling into the same trap, he should make sure that Nigerian refineries are fixed. It doesn't make sense for a country that is the sixth largest producer of oil to be importing 85% of the oil needed for its domestic consumption. The wages of government officials are too fat, they must be reduced, and building trust with the people should be the main focus. Before taking decisions that affect the people, President Jonathan and his advisers should use their political microscope to study the mood of the nation. How can the government remove the subsidy, thereby doubling the hardship of the people on New Year's Day, at a time of massive insecurity? That is an invitation for chaos. But the strike has had one positive effect. The strike and protests have brought Muslims and Christians closer, something that would have been unthinkable a month ago. A listening government could turn this into political capital and a warning to politicians who are desperate to divide the people in order to remain in office. Muhammad Jameel Yusha'u is a senior lecturer in media and politics at the UK's University of Northumbria.","The suspension of strikes and protests by Nigeria's unions will come as a huge relief to ordinary Nigerians, especially those who earn their living from day to day."

"By Giorgos ChristidesThessaloniki, Greece The 54-year-old played a key role in convincing the nation to vote 'No', so he could persuade its creditors to end austerity and forgive part of its debt. Described as a charismatic man and well-respected political economist, he became something of a global celebrity following his appointment to government. But it seems his eurozone colleagues failed to find him so charming. Writing on his website on Monday, Mr Varoufakis said he had been ""made aware of a certain preference by some eurogroup participants, and assorted 'partners', for my… 'absence' from its meetings"". He repeatedly clashed with creditors during recent negotiations - and obviously feels his resignation will help Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras reach a much needed deal with lenders in Brussels. 'Varoufitses' Mr Varoufakis's departure will undoubtedly sadden those who voted him to power. He got more votes than any other candidate in the 25 January general election that swept the leftist Syriza party into government. In the wake of victory he immediately embarked on a European tour that took him to London, Paris, Rome and Berlin. The sight of a shaven-headed, athletic minister refusing to tuck his shirt into his trousers or wear a tie - even while visiting 11 Downing Street - fascinated business reporters, fashion editors and gossip columnists. Even the German media - among Greece's sternest critics - seemed impressed. ZDF television anchor Marietta Slomka said ""he is someone you could imagine starring in a film like Die Hard 6"", and conservative daily Die Welt ran the headline ""What makes Yanis Varoufakis a sex icon"". In his home country, a new word was coined - ""Varoufitses"" - to describe women who idolise Mr Varoufakis. At the time of writing, Mr Varoufakis had 528,000 Twitter followers, a number of devoted fan pages on Facebook, and he has inspired a video game ""Syrizaman Vs Troika"". His eurozone colleagues, however, were not among his fans. In his first meeting with them on 11 February he refused to approve a common statement by the Eurogroup that implied Athens would seek an extension of its bailout. ""Simple logic dictates that if you cannot even conceive the possibility of leaving a negotiation, then it is preferable never to enter one,"" he wrote in a blog entry back in May 2010. Varoufakis soundbites Always defiant Mr Varoufakis showed signs of defiance and non-conformism from a very early age. That includes deliberately misspelling his name Yanis, writing it with only one ""n"" since elementary school. ""I had an aesthetic problem with the double ""n"","" he said. ""So I decided to write my name with one. My teacher gave me a bad grade, which made me very angry and I've kept writing my name with one ""n"" ever since."" Mr Varoufakis was born on 24 March 1961 in Athens. He is a graduate of the Moraitis private school, which has nurtured many members of Greece's political and economic elite. His father, 89-year-old Giorgos Varoufakis, is chairman of Halyvourgiki, a Greek industrial giant. This background of relative privilege did not prevent Mr Varoufakis from becoming a libertarian Marxist, who has said that ""Karl Marx was responsible for framing my perspective of the world we live in, from my childhood to this day"". After receiving his doctorate from the University of Essex he spent a couple of years teaching there and at the University of East Anglia. But Margaret Thatcher's third election victory in 1987 proved too much to bear for Mr Varoufakis, who started to ""plan his escape"" from Britain. His escape destination was not Greece, but Australia, where he taught economics at the University of Sydney. He finally returned to Athens in 2000, a decision he attributed to a combination of nostalgia and, again, an ""abhorrence of the conservative turn of the land Down Under"". In 2005 his ex-wife and young daughter Xenia moved permanently to Australia, leaving Mr Varoufakis ""in a state of shock"". Shortly after, he met his second wife Danae Stratou, who he says saved him from ""oblivion"" and he has been with her every step of the way since. Modern Cassandra Mr Varoufakis burst onto the Greek political scene in 2010, when Athens pleaded for a bailout from its European partners and the IMF. Here was a rare mainstream economist condemning the bailout, warning of impending destruction and urging the government to opt for a default. Most other economists, and most Greek mainstream media, followed the official line: Greece would soon be back to growth and the markets. Mr Varoufakis was happy to play the role of Cassandra, the Trojan princess of Greek mythology with the gift of prophecy, cursed by Apollo to be disbelieved. ""We can stand the pain. The problem is that the troika is suggesting a 'therapy' which, as far as I know, is not just painful but worse than the 'disease',"" he wrote in an early blog post. ""In ten years everyone, not just us, but the entire Europe, will say this 'therapy' was a Big Mistake."" His blog entries, articles and numerous interviews popularised his views. He had a gift of explaining arcane economic terms in layman's language. Marxist in Texas In 2012 Mr Varoufakis left Greece for the United States to teach at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, at the University of Texas at Austin. Mr Varoufakis has said his decision was partly dictated by death threats received for talking about the scandals of Greek banks, and partly by financial concerns, as he was on a modest university salary in Greece. In Texas, he won the hearts of the faculty and students alike. ""Yanis is where he is now because he got it right from the start,"" said close friend and fellow University of Texas professor James Galbraith, who advised Greece in its last-ditch talks with creditors. Prof Galbraith described him as both a brilliant academic and popular teacher at Austin. ""He is an excellent, published academic, with years of research and innovative ideas."" He added that the last star economist he can remember was his own father, celebrated Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith. 'Moral duty' Mr Varoufakis had said he would ""never, never, never"" leave academia for politics. So what made him change his mind? People close to him told the BBC he felt he had a ""moral responsibility"" to accept the invitation of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. They also described him as a workaholic and ideologue, convinced of the failure of austerity politics. He is said to sleep very few hours at night. Experts warned not to expect an about-face under pressure from lenders. They said he would sooner leave politics than betray his beliefs. Some critics said he had the luxury of being defiant, having joint Australian-Greek citizenship and the chance to return to academia whenever he likes. Whether or not he will choose to go back down that path remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain - Mr Varoufakis remains proud of his work in Europe. On Monday he wrote: ""I shall wear the creditors' loathing with pride.""",The resignation of Greece's left-wing Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis will come as a surprise to many voters following his party's overwhelming success in Sunday's bailout referendum.

"Wyre DaviesRio de Janeiro correspondent There's one thing, perhaps above all others, these tribes have in common - the relentless, insatiable pressure on their land and resources. Indeed, there is nowhere else on earth as dangerous for ""defenders"" of land or the environment as Brazil. ""Home"" for the Ka'apor people is a legally defined area of about 5,000 sq km in the fast diminishing forests of Maranhao in the eastern Amazon. The tribe's numbers have recovered in recent years from a perilously low figure of 800 individuals to about 1,800 but their lives and their lands are under constant threat. Since 2008, six Ka'apor leaders have been killed and many more have been injured for trying to protect their land from illegal loggers and miners. The front line of Brazil's land invasion The most recent murder was that of Eusebio Ka'apor (some tribes people adopt common Brazilian names as well as their traditional titles). Eusebio's knowledge of traditional medicines was invaluable in a community that is still wary about regular contact with ""modern"" Brazil. He was shot and killed in an ambush by two hooded men on a motorbike. His killers have not been caught. As is the case in the vast majority of murders or threats against indigenous people, the perpetrators are thought to be connected to powerful business or logging interests and, as such, enjoy the protection of corrupt public officials and law enforcement agencies. Brazil tribe tackles illegal loggers The Ka'apor's response to the constant threat and the inability of federal or state agents to protect them has been to rely increasingly on their own wits and resources to defend themselves. Tribal elders have relocated some of their villages, which number only 10 in total, from the jungle interior to the fringes of their territory. From there men go out on regular patrols, through the forest and along the rivers, to monitor illegal logging or mining. On rare occasions they take the law into their own hands, confronting and briefly detaining loggers then destroying their equipment. It's a risky strategy, because the Ka'apor patrols are only lightly armed with the same small calibre rifles and machetes that they use for hunting, but it underlines the tribe's mistrust of politicians who, they say, prioritise economic development above the protection of traditional lands and peoples. 'Our way is the forest way' Ka'apor elders told me that about 15% of their legally demarcated land has either been invaded or degraded (the removal of tonnes of valuable timber or the pollution of land and waterways by mining operations.) Tribal leaders say their survival depends on these lands, which may seem sizable by comparison to the cramped modern living conditions of urban Brazil, because nearly all of their food, water and resources is sourced from the forest itself. I'd watched earlier in the day as a group of hunters returned to the village with the day's catch, a sizeable deer cut into two and carried on their backs in baskets woven from forest plants. Almost every part of the animal would be eaten over the next two or three days. Nothing goes to waste. That night, after a modest meal of deer, river turtle and rice I sat down with village elders as a council of leaders from several Ka'apor communities met to discuss new reports of illegal logging within their territory. ""We depend on this land, the forest. It feeds us and provides us with what we need,"" said Chief Osmar, resplendent in a modest but colourful headdress made from feathers and beads, reflecting his position as headman of the aldeia, or village. Defending the recent Ka'apor policy of active, rather than passive, resistance the chief said, ""We don't want to live in the city - it has nothing for us. Our way is the forest way and we can't lose that, so even if our blood is spilled we will fight on."" An uphill battle Powerful business interests and allegations of political corruption in Maranhao mean that little action is ever taken against illegal logging or mining operations at a local level. However, the federal environmental protection agency, Ibama, does conduct targeted operations. Several illegal sawmills on indigenous land in Maranhao were destroyed earlier this year and I've witnessed first hand as armed Ibama agents fly risky helicopter patrols into the Amazon to confront rogue logging operations. But it's an uphill battle. Controversial Brazilian laws allow for selective cutting and export of Amazon timber. That's been ruthlessly exploited to such an extent that an estimated 80% of all wood felled and exported is done so illegally. ""In reality we're facing a situation of organised crime. There are well resourced and big financial interests driving this,"" says Ciclene Brito, the regional coordinator for Ibama in Maranhao. ""This problem doesn't just go away. Earlier this year we closed down 15 illegal sawmills in indigenous areas in the north of the state, but they're being re-established in many areas already,"" said Ms Brito. In a major new report, the campaigning organization ""Global Witness"" says that at least 50 environmental campaigners or defenders were killed in Brazil in 2015 alone. Last year was, says the report, ""the worst year on record for killings of land and environmental defenders"", not only in Brazil but also across the developing world where economic and environmental interests collide. Fleeing for their lives It's not just indigenous communities who are losing out to unscrupulous outsiders determined to get their hands on the Amazon's valuable resources. A day's drive from the Ka'apor territory, over dirt tracks and country roads, we're still in the state of Maranhão although the environment and climate feels more arid. Here, in the community of Vergel, it is small-scale farmers and peasants who are being threatened, forced from their land and, sometimes, killed. Sitting in the entrance of the mud and bamboo shack she used to call home, Dona Marina cuts a lonely, broken figure. She built this house with her husband, Raimundo Pereira da Silva, and here they raised a family, eking out a meagre but happy living on their smallholding on the edge of the forest. Raimundo was shot dead by two pistoleiros (gunmen) five years ago after repeatedly ignoring threats to leave his land. ""He went out, after finishing his chores, to wash in the pond behind the house,"" a tearful Dona Marina tells me. ""All of a sudden I heard a shot, my husband cried out. Then a second shot, then nothing."" Marina and her then 10 year-old son, who also witnessed his father's murder, fled to the nearby city soon afterwards, fearing for their own lives. ""Our lives are worthless in the city"", says Dona Marina. ""We didn't have much here but at least it was ours."" The community of Vergel, once about 20 families strong, has disintegrated because of the threats and violence. Destroyed houses and the small church are overgrown with scrub and have long since been abandoned. Father Jose, a German priest who has worked with these rural peasant communities for the last 25 years, says they have almost given up the fight after losing so many of their leaders, with the killers rarely being brought to justice. ""It's a huge problem here and across Brazil, there's complete impunity,"" the Father tells me. ""There's usually evidence and public information indicating who the killers are and who they were hired by but justice is slow and often is absent,"" says the priest who has, himself, been threatened for defending the peasants' rights. Fighting on Back in the Ka'apor village, they're certainly not defeated despite fresh threats against their community and open boasting by loggers that they would ""soon return for the trees."" On our last night in the community, a group of village elders joined hands, danced and sang a song about the animals, the forest and their lives. Earlier a group of indigenous children, the latest Ka'apor generation, had sung the same songs, taught to them by their fathers and mothers. They are a tribe less than 2,000 strong with their own, verbal, unwritten language and customs. They've lost several important leaders in recent years, killed with apparent impunity, but say they have no choice other to fight on. The Ka'apor aren't just fighting for their forest and the land they've lived on for centuries. They're fighting for their survival.",Brazil's indigenous tribes are as diverse as they are numerous: from the south-western sate of Mato Grosso do Sul to the impenetrable northern jungles of the Amazon to the eastern Atlantic seaboard.
"The Carmichael mine, approved by the government last year, would have been one of world's biggest coal mines. Critics challenged the decision in the Federal Court of Australia because of a range of environmental concerns. The court said on Tuesday that the environment minister had failed to heed advice about threats to vulnerable animal species. The decision means the mine could not legally operate until fresh approval was granted, according to Sue Higginson, the principal solicitor for the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) in New South Wales (NSW) Two threatened species The EDO challenged the government's approval of the mine on behalf of the Mackay Conservation Group. The conservation advice describes the threats to the survival of two species found only in Queensland, the Yakka Skink and the Ornamental Snake, Ms Higginson said in a statement. ""The law requires that the Minister consider these conservation advices so that he understands the impacts of the decision that he is making on matters of national environmental significance, in this case the threatened species,"" she said. The Department of Environment said in a statement that reconsidering the decision would not require revisiting the entire approval process. ""Without pre-empting a final decision about the project, the Department expects that it will take six to eight weeks to prepare its advice and the supporting documentation, and for the Minister to reconsider his final decision,"" it said. Massive coal exports Adani, which has struggled to get financial backing for the project, had also won earlier approval to build a new coal port terminal on the Queensland coast to support exports from the mine. In a statement, the company said it was regrettable ""a technical legal error from the Federal Environment Department has exposed the approval to an adverse decision"". ""Adani will await the Minister and his department's timely reconsideration of its approval application ... Adani is confident the conditions imposed on the existing approval are robust and appropriate,"" it said. The project would have dug up and exported about 60m tonnes of coal a year, mostly to India. Environmentalists and reef scientists said work on the port could damage the nearby Great Barrier Reef. Situated in the Galilee Basin in the central Queensland region, the Carmichael project would have included open cut and underground mines.

"Richard Evans, deputy chief officer, said after postponements last week the situation was ""still extremely tight"" and two more surgeries were postponed. He said those in urgent clinical need of treatment may be sent to the UK if operations could not be done locally. Mr Evans said staff sickness and vacancies were factors, but bed numbers was the ""overriding factor"". He said work was being done to make sure ""only those people who really absolutely need to be in hospital are in hospital"". More beds being in use at this time of year is not unusual, but Mr Evans said it combined with a trend for patients needing to be treated for longer due to having more complicated ailments or more than one ailment. He said: ""We have 33 surgical beds, 48 medical beds and 23 rehabilitation beds in Le Marchant Ward, seven ICU [intensive care unit], nine on children's ward and 17 on Loveridge Ward [the maternity ward] and 19 on Vic Wing [Victoria Wing is the private ward]. ""What we're finding is the medical beds, the rehabilitation beds, the surgical beds and Vic Wing are at near capacity.""",More operations at Guernsey's Princess Elizabeth Hospital have been postponed due to a shortage of beds.
"The man, who has only been identified as Alfredo L, was detained in Ciudad Juárez, one year to the day after the murders of the three Mormon women and six children in the state of Sonora. He is the second person to be arrested in connection with the case. The family of the victims says there are more than 100 suspects in the case. What's the case about? Three women and their 14 children - all part of the LeBaron family, a group of US Mormons who settled in northern Mexico - were travelling in a convoy of three cars from the community of La Mora in Sonora state to the neighbouring state of Chihuahua. They were ambushed by gunmen who opened fire on the cars. The three women and six of the children were killed. One of the surviving children, a 13-year-old boy, hid his siblings in the bushes and walked 23km (14 miles) to raise the alarm. When members of the community arrived at the scene, they found one of the cars burnt out with some of the bodies inside. In another car, seven-month old baby Faith Langford was found alive in her baby seat in the footwell of the car. Her mother, Christina Lanford Johnson, was one of the three women killed. She was reportedly gunned down after she had stepped out of the car with her hands raised to try show that those inside were women and children. Who was behind the attack? One of the theories put forward is that the attack was a case of mistaken identity. The area in which the shooting occurred is being fought over by two rival gangs, La Línea and Los Chapos, and it is thought that lookouts for La Línea mistook the convoy of three SUVs the women travelled in for an attack by Los Chapos. The statement by the Attorney-General's office about the arrest of Alberto L did not make clear which of the gangs he is suspected of belonging to, simply alleging that he is ""a member of a criminal organisation present in the north of the country"". Adrian LeBaron, the father of one of the three women killed, expressed his disappointment at the fact that only two suspects are currently in detention in connection with the murders.",The office of Mexico's Attorney-General says that a man has been arrested in connection with the killing of nine members of a Mormon community in 2019.
"By Farouk ChothiaBBC Africa Why will the ANC win again? The ANC is showing signs of decay, but there is no-one to rival its dominance at a national level. The small and divided opposition has failed to capture the popular imagination, except in a few areas. South Africa's first black leader, the late Nelson Mandela, once predicted that the ANC would remain in power until around 2025 - and this is looking quite likely. Liberation movements remained in power for decades in many African countries, as well as India, where Congress governed for 30 years after independence. South Africa profile Could South Africa turn out like Zimbabwe? Some have that fear, but the chances are that South Africa will be a messy but vibrant democracy, as the ANC has a long history of its members kicking out its leaders. South Africa also has a robust media and civil society, a feisty, if small, opposition, a powerful trade union movement and a strong business sector. They are all trying to make sure the independence of democratic institutions is maintained. So far, the judiciary has played an admirable role in keeping a check on state power, along with the offices of the public protector and auditor-general. However, other institutions, such as law enforcement agencies, have been accused of brutality, factionalism and corruption, raising fears that the distinction between party, state and business has become blurred. The criminal underworld has also penetrated the state. One police chief - anti-apartheid struggle veteran Jackie Selebi - has been convicted of taking bribes from a drug dealer; another, Bheki Cele, was dismissed after an investigation found that police buildings had been leased at inflated prices from a private firm, though he was not accused of criminal behaviour. Selebi case like a crime novel South Africa's anti-corruption crusader Why is the opposition so small? Led by Helen Zille, the Democratic Alliance (DA) is the ANC's main challenger. It was once a staunch admirer of the British Conservative party and the late Margaret Thatcher, but it now sees itself as similar to the Liberal Democrats. It has never appealed to South Africa's black voters, who largely see it as a defender of the privileges white people gained during apartheid. As a result, it won only 17% of the vote in the 2009 election, but is expected to increase this to 23% in the 7 May election, according to a recent poll conducted by Ipsos. Profile: Helen Zille Do white South Africans have a future? Is the DA trying to change? In an attempt to broaden its appeal, it has toned down its opposition to affirmative action - an ANC policy which most black professionals and businessmen welcome to help overcome the effects of the racial discrimination they faced during apartheid. In the last election, many of these so-called ""black diamonds"" cast their ballots for the Congress of the People (Cope), formed by an ANC breakaway faction opposed to the uneducated Jacob Zuma's ascent to the presidency. But they feel let down by Cope, which has been hit by leadership battles and legal disputes. The DA is hoping its new young black leaders - especially in Gauteng, South Africa's richest province - will persuade them to vote for the party this time around, but other parties are also confident of gaining their support. The DA has also tried to show it is a ""struggle party"" by marching on the headquarters of the ANC to demand jobs for the unemployed but, as the poll shows, it still has a long way to go to win the confidence of the black majority. Working Lives: Businesswoman Where do other racial groups stand? Like many white people, most Indian and coloured (mixed-race) South Africans tend to be fearful of ANC rule. Even Mr Mandela battled to win their votes, despite his image as a nation-builder. An opinion poll published about three weeks before the election gave the DA 78% of the Indian vote and 72% of the coloured vote. The DA controls one of South Africa's nine provinces, Western Cape, where people of mixed race are in the majority. It is expected to retain control of the province, and fight ANC plans to introduce a new affirmative action policy that would require top managements posts in the business sector to reflect national, rather than provincial, demographics. Is South Africa ready for mixed-race couples? What are voter perceptions of Mr Zuma? Of the four presidents South Africa has had since it became a democracy in 1994, he has the least moral authority. ""No-one believes anything he says,"" says Johannesburg-based political analyst William Gumede. Corruption allegations have swirled around him for many years and these were strengthened with Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's finding that $23m (£13.8m) of taxpayers money was spent on upgrading his private rural residence - including building a chicken run, cattle enclosure, amphitheatre and a swimming pool. Some believe the rot set in during the Mandela presidency, when he showed unflinchingly loyalty to then Health Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma despite calls for her resignation after the public protector found her department had awarded a contract improperly to the minister's friend. Profile: Jacob Zuma How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown So will voters punish Mr Zuma? Some analysts believe the ANC's majority will fall to a historic low of between 55% and 60%, and it could lose overall control of Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria, and would be a clear sign that the party is in decay. But an opinion poll conducted after Ms Madonsela's findings were released gave the party 65% of the national vote - close to the 66% it obtained in 2009. The ANC won in 2009 despite the fact that Mr Zuma was accused of taking bribes from a businessman and a defence company - an allegation he denied. He escaped being put on trial after prosecuting authorities dropped the charges, citing political interference in the case by an ANC faction opposed to him. Mr Gumede says the ANC's biggest electoral advantage is that about 16 million South Africans out of a population of nearly 52 million receive welfare grants, such as child income support for single mothers, to cushion the effects of poverty. This block of voters guarantees the ANC 45% to 50%, as they would not put their grants at risk by defecting to the centre-right DA, he says. What is the ANC record on other issues? Seeing unemployment as an ""assault on human dignity"", Mr Mandela led the ANC's first election campaign in 1994 under the slogan: ""Vote for jobs, peace and freedom"". But his government and its successors have battled to fulfil the first part of this promise, with the official unemployment rate standing at around 24% at the end of 2013. It is the ANC's biggest Achilles Heel, and could cause an uprising. As Mr Mandela's successor Thabo Mbeki once warned: ""When the poor rise they will rise against us all."" Protests, often violent, by people calling for more basic services such as water, housing and schools occur on an almost daily basis. The story is more positive regarding health - the Zuma government has ended the Aids denialism of Mr Mbeki, and is giving free life-saving anti-retroviral treatment to patients. It is also pressing ahead with its plan to create a National Health Service, despite strong resistance from the private health industry, fuelling perceptions that its main focus is on creating a welfare state. Is Julius Malema a big player? With his supporters saying he has charisma similar to that of the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, Mr Malema has styled himself as a revolutionary, wearing a red beret and carrying the title commander-in-chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party as he campaigns for votes. He strikes the most fear among white people, with his calls for the partial nationalisation of the mining and farming sectors, and his support for Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe. But after a poorly organised campaign, he seems to have taken very little support, with the Ipsos poll giving the EFF only 4% of the vote, less than the 5% the DA got among black voters. Five other black-led parties polled less than 3%, and AgangSA, launched by businesswoman Mamphela Ramphele in January, did not register in the survey. Profile: Julius Malema Malema, Marikana and Mugabe What are the battles ahead? The chances are that the opposition will fragment even further, with the biggest union, the National Union of Metalworkers' of South Africa, planning to launch a left-wing party to contest the 2019 election. Its general-secretary, Irvin Jim, has said that ""non-racialism"" is not working in South Africa, with many white people not identifying with the poor black majority. He also accuses the ANC of betraying the ideals of the liberation struggle by failing to promote socialism. It is a sign of the battles that lie ahead between the ANC, DA and their left-wing opponents. Do unions have a future in South Africa? Post-Mandela South Africa is in good shape","Although South Africa is in the throes of one of its worst political and economic crises since apartheid ended 20 years ago, the African National Congress (ANC) looks set to return to power after the 7 May elections."
"The incident happened on 23 April in a town in Kashgar prefecture. Fifteen officials or security personnel were among those killed. China said it was a planned attack by a ""violent terrorist group"". But other accounts dispute this, attributing the confrontation to ethnic tensions in the restive region. Xinjiang is home to the Muslim Uighur minority, who make up about 45% of the region's population but say an influx of Han Chinese residents has marginalised their traditional culture. The authorities often blame violent incidents in Xinjiang on Uighur extremists seeking autonomy for the region. Uighur activists, meanwhile, accuse Beijing of over-exaggerating the threat to justify heavy-handed rule. Verifying reports from Xinjiang is difficult. While foreign journalists are allowed to travel to the region, they frequently face intimidation and harassment when attempting to verify news of ethnic rioting or organised violence against government authorities. The BBC team that visited the site of the incident to try to clarify details were taken by police to a government compound and subsequently ordered to leave. 'Religious extremism' The two men sentenced to death by Kashgar's Intermediate People's Court on murder and terrorism charges were named in state media as Musa Hesen, the co-founder of the ""terrorist group"", and Rehman Hupur. Three other men were jailed for terms ranging from nine years to life. The group had been ""carrying out illegal religious activities (and) promoting religious extremism"", Xinhua news agency reported, citing a court statement. They had also ""made 10 explosive devices and carried out explosive tests"", it said. The violence was sparked when three officials saw suspicious behaviour at a house, Chinese reports say. Residents seized the officials and several more police who came to the scene, many of whom burned to death when the house was set on fire. Security personnel shot six suspects, Chinese reports say. But a group of local people in Selibuya town, where the clashes happened, told the BBC that the violence involved a local family who had a long-standing dispute with officials who wanted the men to shave their beards and the women to stop wearing full veils. A spokesperson for the World Uighur Congress, an umbrella organisation of Uighur groups, also disputed the government's version, saying the clashes were a result of a government clean-up campaign. The incident comes amid rumbling ethnic tensions between the Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese communities. In 2009 almost 200 people - mostly Han Chinese - were killed in deadly rioting in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi. There have been sporadic eruptions of violence since then - in June 2013, 35 people were killed in rioting in the township of Lukqun, about 200km (120 miles) south-east of Urumqi.",Two men have been sentenced to death and three more jailed over a clash in China's far-west Xinjiang region that left 21 people dead.
"Ms Loughlin, the star of US sitcom Full House, and her husband, designer Mossimo Giannulli, were among dozens charged on Tuesday in a college admissions and cheating scandal. Court documents say the couple ""agreed to pay bribes totalling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC [University of Southern California] crew team"". Authorities say neither of the daughters, beauty vlogger Olivia Jade Giannulli and her sister Isabella Rose Giannulli, were actually part of any rowing team. Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman has also been indicted in the investigation. Prosecutors said they have not charged any of the students, though it is unclear what will happen to their college places. The charging document alleges that Ms Loughlin and Mr Giannulli lied, saying that their youngest daughter was a coxswain for the LA Marina Club team and provided a photo of her at a rowing machine to back up her college application. But a guidance counsellor from the sisters' high school noted that neither of the girls participated in rowing and questioned whether ""their applications may have contained misleading information"". After the counsellor expressed concern, Ms Loughlin wrote to a participant in the alleged scam: ""[Our younger daughter] has not submitted all her colleges apps and is confused on how to do so. ""I want to make sure she gets those in as I don't want to call any attention to [her] with our little friend at [her high school]. Can you tell us how to proceed?"" Ms Loughlin's youngest daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli, was copied in on that email, according to investigators. The 19-year-old is already no stranger to controversy. A YouTuber, she faced a backlash last year when she expressed more interest in partying than in studying at USC. Before starting college last year, Ms Giannulli - who launched her YouTube fashion channel in 2014 - was skewered for remarks she made while discussing her plans after graduating from a private high school in California. ""I don't know how much of [university] I'm gonna attend,"" the teenager - who goes by the name Olivia Jade online - told her viewers in a video. ""But I'm gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all. ""But I do want the experience of like game days, partying… I don't really care about [university], as you guys all know."" When some of Ms Giannulli's nearly two million YouTube subscribers called her ""privileged"", ""ignorant"" and ""spoiled"", she backtracked. ""I said something super ignorant and stupid, basically,"" she said on her channel, adding: ""I'm really disappointed in myself."" In September last year, she posted sponsored content on Instagram for Amazon Prime from her new accommodation at USC. ""Officially a college student!"" said the fresher. ""It's been a few weeks since I moved into my dorm and I absolutely love it. ""I got everything I needed from Amazon with @primestudent and had it all shipped to me in just two-days."" Ms Giannulli was later featured in a Teen Vogue article - which also heavily plugged Amazon Prime - about how she and her roommate decorated their college dorm room. ""I ended up ordering everything from Amazon and made sure it all went with her décor but wasn't too matchy matchy,"" she told the magazine. The social media influencer has launched a clothing collection with women's online fashion boutique Princess Polly and a make-up palette with cosmetics chain Sephora. Ms Loughlin said last year she believed it was important for her 20-year-old eldest daughter to get an education, despite her acting career. Isabella Rose Giannulli has starred alongside her mother in two Hallmark cable channel movies, Every Christmas Has a Story and Homegrown Christmas. Ms Loughlin told Salon last August: ""Well, she is in school and I'm glad. She just finished her first year of college and she really enjoys it and I think she'll get her degree. ""And I just said to her, 'Look, have some back up plan. Get a degree and something else.'"" The social media backlash against Olivia Jade Giannulli has been brutal following her mother's indictment. ""Hey dumb ass what's 2+2,"" wrote one commenter on her Instagram page.",The daughters of Hollywood actress Lori Loughlin have been thrust into the spotlight as their mother stands accused of paying a hefty bribe to get them into a top university.
"By Frances MaoBBC News, Sydney In June 1989, Chinese troops used guns and tanks to suppress protesters calling for democracy in Beijing, killing an unknown number of people. Half a world away in Australia, my father Cong Hui Mao watched in horror as the crackdown unfolded on his television set. He had recently moved from China to Sydney, aged 30, on a one-year student visa. In Australia he found a vast nation with the kind of political freedoms that protesters in China had been calling for. The Tiananmen demonstrations had given him hope, and for weeks he closely followed the ""promising flickers"" of a new China. ""It was an exciting time - we felt that we were at a crossroads where we could bring up new ideas,"" he says. ""So when Tiananmen happened, it was like a great fire had been quashed."" In the days following, he joined crowds of Chinese students in Sydney who poured on to the streets to march for their peers at home. ""We were grieving but also angry,"" he says. ""So angry at our government who had attacked its own people."" The images from Beijing horrified the world, including then-Prime Minister Bob Hawke. At a national vigil in Canberra, he cried openly while reading out graphic details from a diplomatic cable: ""When all those who had not managed to get away were either dead or wounded, foot soldiers went through the square, bayonetting or shooting anybody who was still alive. ""Tanks then ran backwards and forwards over the bodies of the slain, until they were reduced to pulp."" Immediately afterwards, Mr Hawke granted visa extensions to all Chinese students in Australia. Mr Hawke later confirmed that he did not consult his cabinet before announcing the decision. He told The Guardian in 2015: ""I have a deep love for the Chinese people... when I walked off the dais I was told: 'You cannot do that, prime minister.' I said to them: 'I just did. It is done.'"" 'Everyone felt grateful' Ultimately, about 42,000 Chinese people took up the offer and forged new lives in Australia. They were given working rights and social support, and later their temporary visas were made permanent. ""Everyone felt so grateful to Hawke for his decision to allow us to stay,"" says my father, who met Mr Hawke on numerous occasions at Chinese community functions held in the politician's honour. ""If he hadn't said that, many of us would have returned to China where we feared it was unsafe, and where we feared China would go backwards."" My mother, Ying Zhu Wang, flew to Australia in 1990 on a student visa. In Sydney, my parents met and married, set up a home and had their first two children. They didn't return to visit China until five years after the massacre. When Mr Hawke died on 15 May, my parents - like many Chinese Australians - contacted their friends and reminisced. Many will join other Australians at Friday's state memorial service. One poem by local resident Zhou Weiqiang has been shared widely among Chinese Australians on social media platform WeChat. It translates to: ""The iron man is tender-hearted, tears welling up in public. Judge the situation and make a general pardon. 40,000 children to help Australia prosper. Think of Hawke, we will see you around."" There is also much gratitude towards Mr Hawke for his attitude towards China after the Tiananmen Square protests. ""He had good relations with China and its development. He understood us,"" my mother says. Jia Lu, a Chinese interpreter and researcher at the University of New South Wales, agrees: ""Of course, we are thankful to him for his action after Tiananmen and the visas that allowed us to bring our families over. But people forget too that he was an Australian politician - a rare politician who kept a positive view of China's development."" She estimates that he attended more than 100 events held by community groups over the years. ""He was a real friend to the Chinese. For me and so many of my friends, we will really miss him."" Transforming Australia Mr Hawke felt the disappointment of Tiananmen deeply because he had been engaging directly with a newly West-looking China, says historian Prof Frank Bongiorno of the Australian National University. ""It's almost beyond inconceivable today for a prime minister to make a unilateral and radical decision like Hawke did,"" he says. ""And he wanted to show Australia as a generous and compassionate society."" The decision drew resistance from some officials and ministers who feared it could overwhelm Australia's migration programme, or lead to resentment among other communities. But it ended up ""transforming the face of Australian multiculturalism"", says Dr Christina Ho, a migration expert at the University of Technology. ""They were a particular group - young, students who then went on to be educated, professional people who have made a huge contribution to Australian society."" Not that it was an easy integration. During the 1980s and 1990s, there was ongoing political debate about the rate of Asian immigration and social cohesion. Many migrants were highly educated but had a poor grasp of English and struggled to find well-paying jobs, says Prof Ho. ""A lot of de-skilling happened in that generation,"" she says. ""But still, they worked hard, integrated into Australian society and raised their own families. Now they're part of the vibrant multicultural society that is Australia today."" This diaspora also became a cultural asset as Australia expanded its trade relationship with China in the 1990s, says Prof Bongiorno. ""You had a significant group of Chinese Australians who were a real resource,"" he says. ""They had the linguistic skills and native sense of the cultural dynamism of Chinese society."" He cites the post-Tiananmen Square intake and Vietnamese migration in the 1970s as two critical points in steering Australia more towards Asia as a society. Those Chinese students provided support for the next stream of Chinese migrants - largely middle class and from the mainland - who have moved to Australia in the past decade. Asia now accounts for more than half of Australia's migration intake. ""Back in 1989, after Tiananmen, we were all scared - China was a closed door,"" says my father. ""Bob Hawke - he showed kindness to us students. He gave us opportunity. Although he's died, we still think of him in our hearts and remember him.""","On Friday, Australians will honour beloved former leader Bob Hawke in a memorial service at the Sydney Opera House. Among them will be many Chinese Australians - including my parents - whose lives changed forever when Mr Hawke offered them asylum after the Tiananmen Square massacre."
"By Sarah RainsfordBBC News, Moscow His call came after days of broken promises blamed on both sides. All day, Russian state television has been rolling pictures of the exodus, portraying a humanitarian act. Russian officials have long claimed there was no ""moderate"" opposition to President Bashar al-Assad left in Aleppo. So they hailed the city's recapture by Syrian government forces as a victory against terrorism. And as Western politicians decried war crimes there, President Putin's spokesman shrugged off such talk this week as ""terrorist propaganda"". Russian condemnation has been reserved instead for the rebels in Aleppo: there was fury here when a military field hospital was shelled, killing two female medics. Moscow's intervention in Syria has always been about projecting its own power and influence, as much as anything. As part of that, state TV aired what it called exclusive images of Russian special forces there this week. The report showed them hitting targets with sniper fire and shells and calling in air strikes by Russian bombers. There was no mention of the indiscriminate bomb attacks blamed on those planes, or of civilians caught up in the bloodshed. Throughout the push to retake Aleppo, TV coverage has instead shown desperate civilians fleeing militant radicals to be met by Russian soldiers with blankets and hot food. The powerful message has clearly hit home. ""I don't think there are any war crimes there,"" one man told the BBC, considering claims by the UN among others. ""There's a war, people are dying and that's sad. Russia is fighting terrorism."" ""I don't think it's fair to accuse Russia of things,"" a young woman agreed. ""Russia is really helping the Syrian army. The legitimate army and legitimate government of Syria."" Russian political analyst Fyodor Lukyanov reasons that there is a ""very important, almost final battle"" in Aleppo ""and in the current situation the winning side will not stop, whatever happens"". He argues that while Russia has influence on President Assad, it does not control him. ""Losses and different problems for the civil population are inevitable, but unfortunately this is a war for survival,"" Mr Lukyanov added. While the West wavered over Syria, Moscow proved decisive and its intervention has now swung the conflict dramatically in favour of its ally. With Aleppo secured, Russia is likely to step up calls for diplomacy once again and push for a negotiated end to the conflict. But some here warn the brutal battles of recent weeks will have radicalised many rebels, and hardened the position of Damascus. ""Assad's regime will not be that eager for political consultations after this,"" Fyodor Lukyanov suggested. ""Assad is not an easy client.""

"On Monday UK Prime Minister David Cameron wrote to 10 British overseas territories, urging them to ""get their house in order"". The island's chief minister Allan Bell said the Isle of Man has led the way in cracking down on tax evaders. The UK is expected to push for tighter tax measures at June's G8 summit. The 10 territories that received Mr Cameron's letter are Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Mr Bell told the BBC Politics Show that there were evasion issues in the UK, US and Europe that needed tidying up and ""not just in smaller jurisdictions"". 'Bad luck guys' ""We have worked on these agreements internationally for well over ten years. We were the first small jurisdiction to commit to the automatic exchange of information of bank accounts to the European Union. That was voluntary and their was no debate going on at that point. Earlier this year the Isle of Man signed tax sharing agreements with both the US and UK governments and more recently entered the ""G5 pilot,"" which would enable automatic information exchanges with France, Germany, Italy and Spain, along with the UK. UK Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: ""The net is closing on those people who have tried to evade taxes."" He added that the willingness and determination of the Isle of Man government to endure that they have a good reputation is ""without doubt."" Isle of Man-based tax consultant George Sharpe said: ""My guess is that anyone using the Isle of Man to evade tax will have pushed off several years ago but if there are any still left in the island it is bad luck guys."" The Isle of Man's Treasury Minister Eddie Teare said: ""The work we have done over the last decade has already changed the perception of the Isle of Man.

"Locals called police at sunrise on Tuesday local time to report the unusual sight. Rescuers were able to capture one of the animals after it got cornered in a yard, but the other was still at large. Experts said it was not yet known whether the pair had been kept as pets or were from the wild. Deer are typically found in grasslands and forests in Australia and are regarded as pests after being introduced from Europe in the 19th Century. The RSPCA and New South Wales Police said the pair had been seen roaming the inner-west suburbs of Annandale, Leichhardt and Balmain. One of the animals was then tracked down in a ""a pretty bad condition"" in a residential courtyard, the RSPCA said. It was captured, sedated and being assessed by vets while officials continued to look for its partner. RSPCA spokesman Kieran Watsons told the BBC they had no clue where the deer had come from. ""We don't know if it's wild and managed to get into the city and hasn't been able to eat for a while, or if it's someone's pet that has gotten loose and doesn't know how to forage or eat,"" he said. On social media, bemused locals reported sightings. ""Walking the dog this morning, I saw them running down Mackenzie Street,"" said one resident on a Facebook community group. ""Thought I was imagining it, but ran into another dog walker who saw them too."" Local mayor Darcy Byrne said: ""This is not an hallucination, just a very strange occurrence... 2020 just continues to deliver. The arrival of Dancer and Prancer in Leichhardt in October is next level."" Earlier this year, Sydneysiders were startled by the sight of three baboons running down a street in another suburb.

"Kevin Jorgeson, 30, and Tommy Caldwell, 36, are the first climbers to do so without aids, except for harnesses and ropes to prevent deadly falls. They began their historic half-mile ascent on 27 December. During the climb the pair slept in tents suspended from the mountain face. 'I will succeed' The men did not give media interviews on completion of their challenge, but are expected to discuss the climb later. Eric Jorgeson, Kevin Jorgeson's father, told local media his son had always been a climber and watching him fulfil a long-time dream had made him proud. ""He climbed everything he could think of. It made us nervous early on as parents, but we got used to it,"" he said. He and his son had begun climbing the other routes to El Capitan's peak in California when Kevin was 15, making it a birthday tradition each year. ""I feel like the most proud person in the world right now,"" Mr Caldwell's sister, Sandy Van Nieuwenhuyzen, said. During their climb up the notoriously difficult Dawn Wall route, both took rest days to wait for their skin to heal and used tape and even superglue to speed the process. At one point it seemed unlikely that they would make it to the top, the BBC's Alastair Leithead at the foot of El Capitan reports. The pair suffered bruising falls, when their grip slipped, and they would bounce off the mountain face. Only their safety ropes saved them from further harm. ""As disappointing as this is, I'm learning new levels of patience, perseverance and desire,'' Jorgeson had posted online at one point. ""I'm not giving up. I will rest. I will try again. I will succeed."" How do they do it?

"The devastating 1985 earthquake struck on 19 September, the very same day as the one this year. It flattened 30,000 buildings in Mexico City and killed an estimated 10,000 people. The Topos volunteers began to lift rubble, look for signs of life and pull people out, assisting the stretched and overwhelmed emergency services. The next year, there was an earthquake in El Salvador and some of Los Topos headed south to help the neighbouring country in need. They have since earned a reputation worldwide, and have assisted after earthquakes in Japan (1995), Colombia (1999), Haiti (2010) and Nepal (2015), among others, and in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami. They travel with small tools - pickaxes and saws, for instance. Now their skills are in need at home again. Although many people have come together to assist with the earthquake rescue, these groups are different; they have specialised knowledge, as they keep up training throughout the year in the earthquake-prone country. They come from many professions but are still an unpaid force, and they work closely with firefighters and paramedics. They receive regular training in first aid, moving through and around collapsed buildings, climbing, managing search and rescue dogs, and fighting fires. Their signal is well known in Mexico: Arms in the air, balled fists. It means: Be quiet. We think we hear someone. Asking for silence like that dates back to the earthquake in 1985. One of the rescuers later told the BBC (in Spanish): ""I remember that the volunteers formed human chains and I watched with curiosity how they asked for silence to try to listen to the people who had been trapped. ""The government was overwhelmed,"" the rescuer, Eduardo Acevedo, continued. ""We had to organise ourselves. ""When people saw that this small group was taking people out of the rubble, they started calling us moles. ""We were the only ones who were ready to act in situations of risk."" On the website of one of the two groups that now carry the Los Topos name, they say: ""To be a Topo, all you need is to want to help people, be tenacious and brave, and have the disposition to want to protect and help.""","They were formed spontaneously in response to a huge earthquake in 1985. Since then, Mexican volunteer rescuers known as the Topos - Moles - have helped in earthquakes from Iran to Nepal. Now, they are needed back at home."
"By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have demanded, inter alia, that Qatar stop funding terrorism - which it denies - downgrade ties with Iran and close down its Al Jazeera broadcaster, or face permanent isolation. Qatar is not backing down. 'Cut all ties' ""Qatar is not responding positively to what we've sent,"" says UAE government spokesman Omar Ghobash, who, as well as being the country's ambassador to Moscow, is also the author of a counter-extremism book, Letters to a Young Muslim. ""I think the whole idea would be to ultimately, simply disengage from Qatar."" Including, I ask him, expelling Qatar from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)? Not immediately, he says, but that is certainly under discussion. Is there a risk this could escalate into a military conflict? ""Not from our side,"" says Mr Ghobash. ""These are relatives and friends. They have a leadership that's decided to undermine us. We'll cut all our ties with Qatar, economic, political and even social as a result of the flight bans."" The deadline imposed on Qatar to comply runs out on Monday, 3 July. What exactly will change then, I asked Mr Ghobash. ""The difference would be that we'd no longer be interested in bringing Qatar back into the Gulf and the Arab fold,"" he says. Pivot towards Iran? So if Qatar is going to be effectively declared a pariah state by its most powerful Gulf Arab neighbours, then is there not a risk for them that this will drive Qatar into the arms of Saudi Arabia's arch rival, Iran? ""Unfortunately Qatar has been in the arms of Iran and many Sunni extremist groups for a long time,"" says Mr Ghobash. ""So the idea of it falling into Iran's lap is something we accept [as a risk] but at least it will provide clarity to the region and we'll know who our friends and enemies are. Iran and Turkey both share Qatar's backing for political Islam and they have both rushed to help the beleaguered Gulf state. Turkey already has a military base there, which the Arab coalition has demanded be closed. Instead, Turkey has airlifted in armoured vehicles, which have been rolling through the capital Doha at the weekend, and has hinted it may reinforce its contingent with hundreds more troops. This has prompted Bahrain to accuse Qatar of ""military escalation"". Around the Gulf there is a degree of irritation that this spat between neighbours has ballooned into such a public and embarrassing quarrel, one which will ultimately damage the whole region's economies. I put it to Mr Ghobash that some people in the West might see this crisis as a needless squabble between dynastic monarchies. ""I would say that is a complete misrepresentation of the situation,"" he responds. ""This is not a squabble between monarchs, this is a serious conflict and a turning point in our societies… This is a principled stand that we are taking against very powerful negative narratives of Islam being funded by countries like Qatar."" For now, neutral Kuwait is trying to mediate, so far without success. But ultimately everyone knows it will be the US that has to broker a solution. The Pentagon has more than 11,000 servicemen and women stationed in Qatar, at Central Command's forward base at Al-Udaid airbase, from which it directs most of its air operations throughout the Middle East. Qatar is an ally of both the US and Britain, and Washington has agreed to sell Qatar $12bn (£9.4bn) worth of sophisticated F15 warplanes. Every day that this crisis drags on adds more uncertainty to the future direction of the US-led military campaign against so-called Islamic State.","With less than a week remaining for Qatar to comply with a tough set of 13 demands from its Gulf Arab neighbours, it is looking increasingly likely that this month's economic and political sanctions imposed on Qatar will become permanent."
"Isaak Hayik set the record by playing as a goalkeeper for Israeli team Ironi Or Yehuda on Friday afternoon. Despite his advanced years, Hayik said he was ""ready for another game"" after playing for the full 90 minutes. He received the Guinness World Records prize at a ceremony after the match, just days ahead of his 74th birthday. Ironi Or Yehuda play in Liga Bet South A, in the fourth tier of the Israeli league. Although his team were beaten 5-1 by Maccabi Ramat Gan, Iraqi-born Hayik is said to have made a series of impressive saves during the game. ""This is not only a source of pride for me but also to Israeli sports in general,"" Hayik told Reuters news agency. One of his sons, 36-year-old Moshe Hayik, described his father's achievement as ""unbelievable"". He joked that he ""used to get tired before he did"" when they played together. Uruguayan Robert Carmona was the previous record holder who, at the age of 53, was part of the starting 11 for Pan de Azucar in 2015. Japanese striker, Kazuyoshi Miura, is the oldest professional footballer to score a competitive goal.

"The sale at auction house Osenat in Fontainebleau, south of Paris, was more than five times the anticipated price. Napoleon wrote the letter in 1816 when he was trying to learn English during his exile on the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena. After a fierce bidding war the letter was bought by the French Museum of Letters and Manuscripts in Paris. Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The one-page letter, dated 9 March 1816, is addressed to Napoleon's companion in exile Emmanuel, the Comte de las Cases, who had been teaching him English. In it, he refers to a ship due to dock in St Helena within seven days, bringing news from Europe. However, it is littered with errors, for instance: ""He shall land above seven day a ship from Europe that we shall give account from anything who this shall have been even to day of first january thousand eight hundred sixteen."" Napoleon appears to have written the letter during a bout of insomnia, putting at the end: ""Four o'clock in the morning."" The letter is one of just three in the world known to have been written in English by Bonaparte. The former emperor died on St Helena in 1821 age 51. The Comte de las Cases wrote a book about his time on the island, and recalled how Napoleon had wanted to learn the language of his British captors. Around the BBC BBC - History - Napoleon Bonaparte","A rare letter in English by Napoleon Bonaparte has been sold at auction for 325,000 euros ($400,000; £264,000)."
"The quake hit between Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), the US Geological Survey (USGS) said on Tuesday. Buildings shook and tremors were felt across the Caribbean, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Some offices were temporarily evacuated in Miami and parts of Jamaica. Warnings by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) were later withdrawn. The PTWC initially said ""hazardous tsunami waves"" were possible for coasts located within 300km (186 miles) of the earthquake's epicentre. This included parts of Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, it said. But in an update at around 20:45 GMT, the PTWC said the ""tsunami threat had now largely passed"". Seismologist Dr Lucy Jones tweeted: ""The M7.7 Jamaican quake produced sideways motion on the fault, so the tsunami risk is low."" The epicentre of the quake, initially reported as magnitude-7.3 before being upgraded, was 125 km north-west of Lucea, Jamaica. Shaking was reported in the Cuban capital, Havana, in Kingston, Jamaica and Miami - some some 708 km from the epicentre. Pictures from Miami showed office workers gathered in car parks and thronging the streets after the quake struck at around 14:10 Miami time (19:10 GMT). There were no injuries or road closures, Miami police said. USGS geologist Ryan Gold told the Miami Herald it was ""completely reasonable"" for a quake of that magnitude to be felt in Florida. ""It's a very large earthquake which can produce a lot of seismic energy,"" he said. ""I felt the house trembling and realised that it was a quake,"" Kingston resident Jawara Rawjers told AFP news agency. Machel Emanuel, a doctor in the same city, added: ""I was on the second floor of a building and there was a sustained shaking of the building. I felt dizzy. The door was slamming consistently for a while."" In the Cayman Islands, a warning to ""move away from coastal areas"" was issued by the government but stood down a few hours later. On Twitter, Cayman authorities said there were ""only a few reports of structural damage to buildings"" and shelters were being opened as a precaution. Mikhail Campbell, a police media relations officer in the Cayman Islands, told Reuters news agency he was not immediately aware of any reports of serious damage.","A powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake has struck in the Caribbean, prompting brief tsunami warnings and office evacuations as far away as Florida."
"She also kept up the pressure on Pakistan to deny militants sanctuary in tribal areas near the Afghan border. Mrs Clinton was speaking in Kabul after talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. She is due to travel on to Pakistan. Relations between the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan are currently strained. Mr Karzai has expressed frustration at the process to engage the Taliban after the assassinations of several key Afghan leaders. ""We are increasing the pressure on the Taliban,"" Mrs Clinton said. She added that militants could be part of a peaceful future for Afghanistan or ""face continuing assault"". Mrs Clinton called for a new partnership between the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan to fight insurgents. She said Pakistan ""must be part of the solution"" . ""That means ridding their own country of terrorists who kill their own people and who cross the border to kill people in Afghanistan,"" Mrs Clinton said. The US secretary of state is due in Islamabad later on Thursday where she will be joined by CIA chief David Petraeus and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Martin Dempsey. 'Reconciliation is possible' ""We intend to push Pakistan very hard,"" Mrs Clinton said. ""We will be looking to the Pakistanis to take the lead because the terrorists operating outside of Pakistan pose a threat to the Pakistanis as well as to others. ""Our message is very clear: We are going to be fighting, we are going to be talking and we are going to be building... and they [militants] can either be helping or hindering but we are not going to stop."" She added: ""Insurgents must renounce violence, abandon al-Qaeda and abide by the laws and constitution of Afghanistan, including its protections for women and minorities. ""Reconciliation is possible - indeed, it represents the best hope for Afghanistan and the region."" US officials say Mrs Clinton also wants to convince Afghans that Washington is committed to a long-term relationship with their country. The US is planning to withdraw troops and hand over security to the Afghans by 2014. Mrs Clinton arrived in Kabul on her unannounced visit late on Wednesday. US officials said she wanted to show support for Mr Karzai following the assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani. Mr Rabbani was a former Afghan president tasked with trying to reconcile the Taliban with Mr Karzai's US-backed government. He was killed last month by a suicide bomber posing as a Taliban envoy. After his assassination, Mr Karzai discontinued attempts to negotiate with the Taliban, saying the process should be led by the country backing them - a reference to Pakistan, which he blames for much of the violence. Mrs Clinton met civic leaders at the US embassy in Kabul before her scheduled meeting with President Karzai. She assured women's rights activists, education officials and politicians that their concerns were ""being heard at the highest levels of the US government"". ""I am here to have a reality check,"" she said. ""I want to hear what people in Afghanistan are thinking about the way forward."" Mrs Clinton also met Mr Rabbani's son, Salahuddin, telling him that his father ""was a brave man and trying to do the right thing"". Salahuddin Rabbani replied: ""We will make sure we continue his vision."" As well as assassinations, militants have carried out a number of brazen assaults on major cities and military targets in recent months. The Haqqani network of the Taliban, based in Pakistan, has been blamed for many of the attacks. US officials have suggested the Haqqanis are linked to Pakistan's intelligence services, a charge Pakistan denies.","US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has urged the Taliban to be part of a peaceful future in Afghanistan or ""face continuing assault""."
"It is impossible to explain Jakarta's election without first introducing Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, who stepped up in 2014 when then-governor Joko Widodo became president. Mr Purnama is the first Christian and ethnic Chinese leader of the Muslim-majority city in more than 50 years, and now is running for another term. He was seen as the favourite to win - and for some, as a potential future president - until he was charged with blasphemy in late 2016, a criminal offence in Indonesia. Despite mass protests against him, Mr Purnama led the election's first round in February but without enough votes to secure the job outright, so a second round will be held on 19 April. His opponent is a former education minister and Islamic conservative Anies Rasyid Baswedan, who has gone from being the most unpopular candidate to the strongest contender, according to recent polls. The blasphemy case testing Indonesia's very identity It is an election divided not just by politics but by religion too and of all things, hoaxes have put a potent edge on these tensions. ""We recorded that there are more than 1,900 alleged-hoax reports in recent three months,"" said Khairul Ashar, a co-founder of Turn Back Hoax - a crowd-sourced digital initiative where they collected and debunked hoaxes spreading in social media. ""More than 1,000 reports have been confirmed as hoaxes. Most of these are about politics, mainly about Jakarta's gubernatorial election. And religious issues play a big role,"" said Mr Ashar, who lives in Singapore. Alternative facts The recent visit of Saudi Arabia's king is one of the examples of how the truth was reversed in the online imagination. This picture of Mr Purnama shaking hands with King Salman when he arrived in Jakarta early March was condemned as false on social media even though it was captured by the Indonesian president's official photographer. King Salman is widely praised in Indonesia as an Islamic role model, so this photo would be seen as a great boost for Mr Purnama. But groups opposed to him said, ""This news is hoax, because it is haram for a king to shake hands with the blasphemer of Islam."" One Facebook user even posted a long analysis explaining how it was a fake story. Some did retaliate: ""You have (official) picture, and also an (official) video (of them shaking hands), but still people thought it was fake. Your life is a hoax."" Recently, President Joko Widodo inaugurated the first city-owned grand mosque in Jakarta, but some people argued it looked like a cross, and then proceeded to accuse Mr Purnama of ""Christianisation"". Mr Purnama's opponent has also been smeared by hoaxes and launched an anti-hoax website to counter it called fitnahlagi.com (which translates as defamed again). There were also fake posters spread online saying: ""If Mr Baswedan loses the election, there will be Muslim Revolution"" with provocative pictures of men wearing white clothes and holding swords. 'The dark age' This is a big concern for IT activists. ""We must change our campaign narrative now,"" said Matahari Timoer, one of the members of Jakarta-based Internet watchdog ICT Watch. ""It used to be 'think before share', but now we urge people to 'do your part'."" He was talking about their campaign battling the danger of hoaxes and he says there is an urgent need for the ""silent majority to speak up and raise their voice on social media."" ""Our digital life has entered a dark age, that is why we need people to do their part as a lantern to light up, and fight this dark period,"" he said. As a former member of a Muslim radical group he understands what's at stake - a rising religious intolerance dividing a nation. Indonesian President Joko Widodo even declared a war against ""fake news"" late last year. There are more than 40,000 websites claiming to be news sites, but most of them are not registered, said the Press Council, who has launched an online media verification system to filter fake news. Recently, the communications and information ministry urged Twitter and Facebook to combat hoaxes on their own platform. But many believe those efforts are not enough. Mr Timoer underlined what people called dark social media: WhatsApp groups and Telegram's secret groups, more intimate and influential. So could fake news really influence the final round of Jakarta's election? ""It will affect emotional voters. They persist with what they choose based on information related to religion and ethnicity,"" said Mr Timoer. But he thinks it will only have a small impact in the end. Mr Ashar thinks differently. He believes the threat behind these hoaxes goes way beyond Jakarta's political battle. ""Some groups want to change philosophical foundation of the country, and in the name of freedom of speech they use hoaxes in social media to gain followers,"" said Mr Anshar. All the activists know that even after this election is over, the hoaxes will continue their battle for the hearts and minds of Indonesia's public.","In Indonesia, the rise of fake news, hoaxes, and misleading information online has cast a pall over an already bitterly divided election in the capital, Jakarta. BBC Indonesian's Christine Franciska looks at why activists are describing this as a dark era in Indonesia's digital life."
"A liberal, Moon Jae-in, is the strong favourite with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger. If Mr Moon wins, the South will likely change course on North Korea, with the candidate wanting to increase contact with the rogue regime. But corruption and the economy are greater concerns for domestic voters. A record turnout is predicted, with numbers boosted by younger voters, as South Koreans choose from 13 candidates. Polls close at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT), with the winner expected to be announced soon after. The new leader is likely to be sworn in on Wednesday. Will ties with the North be affected? Heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula in recent weeks have made the perennial worries over the South's volatile neighbour a key issue. Mr Moon, of the Democratic Party of Korea, has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions. Both he and Mr Ahn have urged US President Donald Trump to cool his rhetoric towards the North after his administration suggested it might take military action over Pyongyang's weapons programme. However, Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative governing Liberty Korea Party attacked Mr Moon's approach, saying on Thursday morning that the election was a ""war of regime choices"". State media in North Korea advocated a return to an earlier era of communication and co-operation known as the Sunshine policy, seen as an endorsement of Mr Moon who was part of the previous South Korean government which promoted that policy. What are the other issues? All the candidates are promising to protect the fragile recovery in South Korea's economy - the fourth largest in Asia - and to bring down youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high. There have been vows to reform the family-run conglomerates - chaebols - which dominate the domestic economy. Whoever wins will have to deal with China, which retaliated economically over the deployment of a US missile defence system in the South. Candidates have been promising a break from the past as symbolised by the deeply unpopular impeached former leader, Park Geun-hye. A 22-year-old voter said: ""I voted with the hope of not electing the same kind of president again in future."" Low security, high turnout: analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Seoul South Korea has been energised by a string of events from the confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korean nuclear weapons to the ousting of the previous president over allegations of corruption. In Western democracies, there have been hints of disillusion with politics and politicians but that has not been on display here. Candidates have vowed to clean up corruption - but so has every other winner of a presidential election in South Korea, only to get snared in the very corruption they denounced en route to power. This election has been refreshing in that security at rallies has been lower-key than at those in the United States, in particular, and in some countries in Europe. At times, the front-runner, Moon Jae-in, was in danger of being pulled off the stage by people tugging his hand. Where's Park today? In March, Ms Park became the first South Korean president to be removed from power by impeachment. She is spending election day in jail and South Korean media report she will not be casting a vote. The 65-year-old is accused of allowing a close friend to extort money from companies. She denies wrongdoing - although she has repeatedly apologised - and is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power. Huge crowds had protested against her, fuelled by anger over inequality and the perceived privilege of South Korea's elite.","South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader."
"Mr Farinas ended a hunger strike in July after the Cuban government agreed to release 52 political prisoners. During his campaign for human rights he has staged more than 20 hunger strikes and spent more than 11 years in prison. Mr Farinas, 48, said he accepted the award in the name of the Cuban people and all those who campaigned for greater freedom in Cuba. Speaking to the BBC Mr Farinas said he thought the honour could make his campaign for greater freedom in Cuba more difficult. ""Anyone who is familiar with the Cuban regime understands that as a dissident becomes more well known the attacks against him become more sophisticated, more bloody and more inhuman"", he said. But he said he was not afraid to continue his campaign for peaceful change in the island. ""The only fear I have is of failing the Cuban people and the campaign for democracy in Cuba"", he said. Bargaining chip He added that he expected the communist government to release more jailed dissidents. ""I think the Cuban government has learned that to win over the European Union, it has to make gestures that are public and visible"", he said. ""For the government, political prisoners are a bargaining chip with the civilised world. We are slaves that they can sell when they want."" Cuban human rights groups say that, there are still about 100 jailed dissidents on the island. The Cuban government denies they are political prisoners, calling them mercenaries paid by the US to undermine the revolution. It has made no comment on the award to Mr Farinas. Mr Farinas, a psychologist and journalist, had been near death while on hunger strike this year, doctors said. The MEPs who nominated him for the prestigious award called him ""a beacon of hope for dozens of journalists and activists who are currently in prison"". Announcing the award on Thursday, the parliament president Jerzy Buzek said Mr Farinas ""was ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba"". Cubans have been awarded the prize twice before: dissident Oswaldo Paya in 2002 and the Ladies in White group of women whose husbands are jailed in Cuba, which won the award in 2005. The European Union, like the US, has urged Cuba for years to free political prisoners and improve human rights. The Sakharov Prize was named after the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and was first awarded in 1988. It includes a cash award of 50,000 euros. The Russian human rights group Memorial won the award last year. Spain has called on the EU to normalise relations with Cuba, but the Czech Republic and Slovakia - former communist bloc countries - are among the member states against that idea. EU foreign ministers are due to discuss relations with Cuba next week.",The European Parliament has awarded its Sakharov human rights prize to Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas.
"Mr Hollande said France owed them ""a debt of blood"". The veterans - many from Senegal, and aged between 78 and 90 - received their new certificates of citizenship at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Campaigners have long been calling for the rights of the veterans, long-term French residents, to be recognised. ""France is proud to welcome you, just as you were proud to carry its flag, the flag of freedom,"" said President Hollande. More naturalisation ceremonies are expected to follow for other veterans in France. One of those granted citizenship on Saturday, Mohamed Toure, said the gesture will go some way towards healing old wounds. ""President Hollande did what none of his predecessors ever imagined. And that repairs a lot of things,"" he said. The granddaughter of a Senegalese soldier, Aissatou Seck, who is herself deputy mayor of a Parisian suburb, has been a lead campaigner for African veterans' rights. Last year, she started a petition that gained tens of thousands of signatures in less than a week. The veterans have long been struggling for recognition and equality in France. Until 2010, they received lower pensions than their French counterparts. Their ambiguous status also meant they lacked access to other benefits and sometimes found it difficult to travel, said the BBC's Africa editor, Mary Harper. In 1944, dozens of West Africans were shot dead by French troops when they mutinied over unequal pay and pensions. A few years ago, Mr Hollande acknowledged that French soldiers had gunned down their African counterparts. But many war veterans are still demanding a full apology.",French President Francois Hollande has given citizenship to 28 Africans who fought for France in World War Two and other conflicts.
"It feels so scary at the moment, the picture is very grim. If the Coptic Pope [Tawadros II, the head of the Egyptian Christian community who narrowly escaped the blast in Alexandria], has been targeted, how can Christians feel safe? The message sent out to Christians is that you are vulnerable wherever and whenever. Christians in Sinai were forced to flee after militant threats there, although the peninsula has been living under a state of emergency for years. The state of emergency didn't protect them. The regime [of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi] is not pro-freedom of speech. So, it might only impose more restrictions and incriminate people who have nothing to do with the whole thing. Christians in Egypt always feel they are second-class citizens. In some parts of the country, especially in the south, their houses have been set on fire and they have been beaten up by some Muslim neighbours. It seems the state is unwilling to fix this issue. It is not just about lax security here, it is more about a culture of discrimination. There is a view among Egyptians that the Coptic Church is siding with the state. The Church has paid a heavy price for such a stance. It is considered a supporter of the regime, and therefore is becoming a target for the militants' attacks. Besides, whenever sectarian incidents take place, the Church issues statements which do not reflect how outraged Christians really are. The frequency of these attacks is quite alarming. In the past, there was some sort of public resentment for attacking churches. But when they become frequent, people will just get used to it. It won't be shocking any more. It might even encourage other radical Muslims to do the same. Interview by Sally Nabil, BBC Arabic","In the wake of a deadly double-bombing at Egyptian churches, Ishak Ibrahim, a Coptic Christian from the non-governmental Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, tells of a climate of fear among his community."
"Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said he hoped Europol would carry out ""a thorough check and analysis"" of the information gathered so far. Bulgaria last week said it believed the two suspects are members of Hezbollah. The Lebanese Shia group has strongly denied any involvement in the attack. The bus carrying Israeli tourists was attacked by a suicide bomber at the airport of the Black Sea resort of Burgas on 18 July 2012. Israel swiftly blamed Hezbollah - and Iran - for the bombing. Revealing the results of a six-month inquiry into the bombing a week ago, Tsvetan Tsvetanov said the suicide bomber had been helped by two suspects, holding Australian and Canadian passports, who had direct links to Hezbollah. The men had lived in Lebanon since 2006 and 2010 respectively, the AFP news agency quoted Mr Tsvetanov as saying. He added that they were both members of the militant wing of Hezbollah and there was information showing the financing and connection between them and the Shia group. 'Global terror' Mr Tsvetanov handed over the findings of the inquiry during a meeting on Tuesday with Europol director Rob Wainwright in The Hague. Europol coordinates policing across the 27 European Union nations. The suspects' names were put into Europol's database to find out whether they had been to other EU member states, Bulgarian news agency BTA reported. Bulgarian experts were expected to travel to the Netherlands in the coming days to work with Europol, it said. Until now, the EU has not followed the US lead in labelling Hezbollah a terrorist organisation. In response to Bulgaria's report last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah and Iran were ""waging a global terror campaign across borders and continents"" and urged European nations to ""reach the required conclusions regarding the true nature of Hezbollah"". If there was proof of Hezbollah's involvement in Burgas, it would be the group's first successful terror attack in Europe since the mid-1980s, Europol's Rob Wainwright said last week.",Bulgaria has given the EU's police agency the names of two people it suspects of involvement in the bus bombing that killed five Israeli tourists and a bus driver last July.
"In theory, the ""sovereign internet"" law gives officials wide-ranging powers to restrict traffic on the Russian web. The Kremlin has said the law will improve cyber security. A spokesman said users would not notice any change. Critics fear the Kremlin will try to create an internet firewall similar to that in China. Experts say it is unclear how the powers of the controversial law might be used, or how effectively they can be implemented given the technology challenges and high costs. What's the law about? It gives the Kremlin the possibility to switch off connections within Russia or completely to the worldwide web ""in an emergency"". It is up to the government to decide what constitutes a threat and what actions should be taken. The law requires internet service providers to install network equipment - known as deep packet inspection (DPI) - capable of identifying the source of traffic and filter content. In practice, this will allow the country's telecommunications watchdog Roskomnadzor to be more effective at blocking sites. Russia is seeking to route the country's web traffic and data through state-controlled points, reducing reliance on foreign servers over which it has less control. Supporters say this is to protect the system from attacks from abroad. To help with this project, the country is working on developing its own net address books so it can operate almost autonomously, although this work will not take effect until 2021. US intelligence has said Russia used the internet to interfere in the US 2016 presidential election, an allegation Moscow denies. This is the latest in a swathe of tougher internet laws approved by Russia. Earlier this year, parliament passed two bills outlawing ""disrespect"" of authorities and the spread of what the government deemed to be ""fake news"". Is it what they say it is? All the official talk is about how this law will ensure Russia keeps functioning if the West ""attacks"" and cuts the country off from the internet. That is why it is dubbed the ""sovereign internet"" bill: to underline how Russia can survive in isolation - even thrive, as it claims it has under Western sanctions. All the chatter, though, is that the law actually aims to increase control over the internet here inside Russia. The DPI technology being tested allows the state regulator to filter traffic and block what it wants. The criteria for such censorship is usefully vague. The hugely popular messaging app Telegram will likely be an early target. The regulator's last attempt to block it using IP addresses was a flop as hundreds of other sites and service were knocked off line instead. If the filtering technology is installed nation-wide, IT experts are sure all users will feel it. One compared the attempt to squeeze all internet traffic through the DPI ""black boxes"" to the crush of passengers trying to get on the Moscow metro at rush hour. Why are there concerns? Campaigners say the law, which was signed by President Vladimir Putin earlier this year, is an attempt to increase censorship, building on the internet legislation that already curtails freedom of expression and privacy. ""Now the government can directly censor content or even turn Russia's internet into a closed system without telling the public what they are doing or why,"" said Rachel Denber, Human Rights Watch's deputy Europe and Central Asia director. The law, observers say, allows the government to block content without judicial consent and leaves users unaware about what information is being blocked and why. Christian Mihr, from the group Reporters Without Borders, said: ""[The law] proves that the Russian leadership is ready to bring the entire network infrastructure under political control in order to cut off the digital information flow whenever needed."" But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government had no plans to isolate internet users: ""No-one is suggesting cutting the internet."" In March, thousands of people protested in Moscow against the law.",A law introducing new controls on the internet has come into force in Russia amid concerns it may be used by the government to silence its critics.
"The koala, dubbed Lewis, had been taken to an animal hospital last week after a woman plucked him from a tree in burning bushland in New South Wales. Video of the rescue - which shows Toni Doherty using her shirt to wrap up the koala - was viewed globally. Vets said the marsupial was put down because his burns were not improving. ""[Our] number one goal is animal welfare, so it was on those grounds that this decision was made,"" said Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Six people have died and more than 500 homes have been lost since a bushfire crisis began ravaging Australia in September. 'It was just so heart-rending' In the video, Ms Doherty is seen pouring water over the distressed animal in an attempt to cool it. She told local news outlets she had been driving through the forest when she spotted the koala among the flames and heard its cries. ""I didn't realise they could cry out. It was just so heart-rending and I knew I needed to get him out of there as quickly as possible,"" Ms Doherty told Nine News. The 14-year-old koala had significant burns to its chest, feet and other parts of its body, vets said. The hospital has treated dozens of koalas injured from the bushfires which have burnt through more than a million hectares in New South Wales alone. The blazes continue to burn and officials warn that the worst of Australia's season is still to come.","A koala which drew wide attention after being rescued from an Australian bushfire has died, after failing to recover from his burns."
"An estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were registered by Frontex last year, the lowest amount since 2013. It highlighted a sharp fall in the numbers crossing the Mediterranean to Italy, where a populist government has refused to allow rescue boats to dock. But it said that arrivals in Spain had doubled for the second year in a row. What do the figures show? The number of people detected in 2018 was 92% below that of 2015, when Europe's migration crisis was at its peak. The figure also fell by a quarter compared to 2017, with the biggest fall reported along the central Mediterranean route from northern Africa to southern Italy. The number of illegal crossings detected there plummeted by 80% to slightly more than 23,000, Frontex says. It added that the number of departures from Libya dropped by 87% in one year, and those from Algeria fell by nearly a half. Frontex says the western Mediterranean route is now Europe's most active. The number of illegal arrivals in Spain - mostly from Morocco - doubled to 57,000 in 2018. The agency also gathered data on the gender and ages of those caught trying to enter the EU illegally. Women accounted for 18% of them, it says, while nearly one in five said they were under the age of 18. The figures differ from those recorded by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) which says that 123,109 illegal migrants arrived in the EU last year. Frontex says this discrepancy is due to the fact that they cover all of the EU's external land borders whereas the UN primarily measure sea borders. What's behind the changes? The recent fall in the number of migrants attempting to take the central Mediterranean route to Italy follows the election of a populist government that has taken a hardline stance on immigration. The government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. It has pursued a number of measures to prevent rescued migrants from landing on its shores. In September, it passed a bill that was intended to make it easier to deport migrants and strip them of Italian citizenship. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has also frequently come into conflict with migrant rescue ship operators and has banned these ships from docking at Italian ports. Italian policy is that migrants picked up at sea should be returned to Libya by that country's coastguard. But charities and human rights groups say migrants face appalling conditions in Libya, where abuse at the hands of people-trafficking gangs are rife. Officials have also warned that those crossing the Mediterranean face a more dangerous journey than ever before. In September, UNHCR said that while the number of people arriving in Europe had fallen, the number of deaths had risen sharply. International Organization for Migration (IOM) data says that more than 2,000 people died or went missing making crossings last year. ""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risks, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean, said at the time.","The number of people caught trying to enter the EU illegally has fallen to its lowest level in five years, the bloc's border agency says."
"""Charlie Hebdo is alive and will live on,"" Mr Hollande said. Millions more copies of the magazine are being printed because of demand. It comes a week after Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at its offices and five others in subsequent attacks. The new edition has angered some Muslims by depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The cartoon shows the Prophet weeping while holding a sign saying ""I am Charlie"", and below the headline ""All is forgiven"". ""I am Charlie"" emerged as a message of support for both the magazine and free speech following the attacks that started on 7 January. The Afghan Taliban on Thursday denounced the latest cartoons. The militants ""strongly condemn this repugnant and inhumane action,"" a Taliban statement quoted by AFP news agency said. The group also praised last week's attacks. Survivors' issue Following the publication of Wednesday's Charlie Hebdo issue, President Hollande said: ""You can murder men and women but you can never kill their ideas."" He said the magazine had been ""reborn"" in the week after the killings. It will have a print run of five million issues this week, dwarfing the normal circulation of about 60,000. The ""survivors' issue"", as the magazine calls it, is available in six languages including English, Arabic and Turkish. Proceeds are going to victims' families. Eight journalists, including its editor, were killed in addition to four others when two brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, stormed Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris on 7 January. In a separate attack in the city two days later, an Islamist gunman killed four Jewish men and took hostages at a kosher shop. The same attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, is believed to have shot a policewoman the day before. 'World fallen apart' A video purportedly from al-Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP) said it planned and financed the Hebdo attack as ""vengeance for the Prophet"", but did not provide evidence to support its claims. The gunmen are said to have used earlier publication of images of the Prophet as justification for their attack on the magazine. AQAP had previously welcomed the assault, without acknowledging any role in the operation. A lawyer for Said Kouachi's wife, Soumya, has told the BBC she had no idea he was an extremist. He said Kouachi had kissed his wife goodbye and told her he was visiting his brother, because he was unwell, just hours before the Charlie Hebdo attack. ""It's beyond her understanding, her world has fallen apart,"" the lawyer, Antoine Flasaquier, said. Charlie Hebdo's decision to publish another cartoon of the Prophet drew threats from militant Islamist websites and criticism from the Islamic world. The Islamic State (IS) militant group said it was ""an extremely stupid act"". The release comes after millions - including dozens of world leaders - took part in a unity rally in Paris on Sunday. Outside France, the Washington Post, Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine, Corriere della Sera in Italy and the UK's Guardian are among publications that have shown the latest cartoon. The BBC has published the image in a previous story and in a statement said: ""We have made the editorial judgment that the images are central to reporting the story."" Why people are buying the magazine Catherine Boniface, Paris: ""This issue is symbolic, it represents their persistence, they didn't yield in the face of terror.""

Among those arrested on Wednesday was controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, who was accused of ""defending terrorism"" after he likened himself to gunman Amedy Coulibaly. He was released later on Wednesday but is to face trial at a later date, according to his lawyer.

"Some of the displaced Yazidis managed to escape across the Syrian border by foot, fleeing violence from the Islamic State militants who have taken over their home town of Sinjar. Who, What, Why: Who are the Yazidis? Officials for the Kurdish regional government say some 20,000 to 30,000 managed to cross the Iraqi-Syrian border at the weekend. Video: The Yazidi families fleeing for their lives The UK and US have carried out air drops of food and water supplies into Mount Sinjar to alleviate the suffering of the Yazidi refugees there. Many fled their homes in a hurry and lack the food and water supplies to survive several days on the rocky mountain range in temperatures reaching 38 degrees Celsius. The UN says over 50 Yazidi children have died of dehydration. Those who left the mountain transited through Syria over the Tigris river and crossed back into Iraqi Kurdistan. Some families were separated as they fled in panic from their homes, with many not knowing the fate of their loved ones left behind. Kurdish Peshmerga forces were on hand to deliver bottles of water to thirsty arrivals at the Fishkhabur crossing in northern Iraq. Trucks and vehicles jam packed full of Yazidis were seen inching across the Iraqi-Syrian border.","Thousands of people from the Yazidi religious community have sought refuge on the arid heights of Mount Sinjar, close to the Syrian border."
"China Daily says order has been restored after violent clashes between armed men and officials and police in Bachu county near Kashgar in the western part of Xinjiang on Tuesday. The confrontation, described by the region's information office as a ""severe, violent terror incident"", left 21 people dead, the newspaper adds. An editorial by China Daily says the violence is another bloody reminder that East Turkestan ""terrorists"" and the ""terrorist organisations of neighbouring countries"" remain a ""clear and present danger"" in Xinjiang. Counter-terrorism experts tell Global Times that ""terrorists"" and separatists in Xinjiang share supplies with al-Qaeda and have fought in Chechnya, Afghanistan and Syria. ""However, the West has been holding double standards in the definition of terrorism. If the East Turkestan separatists carry out evil deeds in Xinjiang, some Western opinions whitewash them as seeking 'national self-determination'"", Pan Zhiping, a professor from Xinjiang University, tells the newspaper. Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-backed Hong Kong newspaper, says the US' ""double standards"" over terrorism and Chechen separatists were to blame for bomb attacks in Boston. It urges the US to ""learn a lesson"" and not harbour Xinjiang separatists. The World Uyghur Congress, an exiled Uighur activist group in Germany, yesterday rejected China's claims of terrorism. The group says the violence started after Chinese ""armed personnel"" shot dead a young Uighur during inspection raids. The state-run Global Times newspaper accuses the World Uyghur Congress of defending ""terrorists"". ""These forces wish for turbulence in Xinjiang to hinder China's development... Separatism is like gibberish spread by psychos, which has no appeal at all,"" the newspaper's bilingual editorial says. More 'friction' In other international news, Global Times calls on China to ""step up military preparations"" without engaging in actual combat. Its calls follow Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's warning earlier this week that Tokyo will resort to armed force against any attempt to land on disputed islands claimed by both China and Japan. ""If Japanese civil servants land on the islands, we will also send civil servants to land on the islands. The two countries' law enforcement forces may engage in confrontation or even 'fighting', but it may not necessarily develop into a 'war',"" the newspaper says. ""As long as the two sides do not send warships, China should build larger maritime surveillance ships to engage in 'friction' with Japanese vessels,"" it adds. In an interview with International Finance News, Dong Manyuan, deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies, a foreign ministry think-tank, refutes India's complaints that around Chinese soldiers crossed the Line of Actual Control and set up a tent post in Ladakh on 15 April. ""We did not cross the line and will not accept India's remarks. The matter will be resolved through friendly consultations... Over the years, more than 90% of disputes have been resolved through peaceful negotiations. This approach has been effective,"" Mr Dong comments. Rear-Adm Song Xue, navy deputy chief of staff, has told foreign military attaches that China's next aircraft carrier will be bigger and carry more jet fighters, notes Southern Metropolis Daily. However, he denies foreign media reports that the country is building new aircraft carriers in Shanghai. Taiwan has confirmed the first case of H7N9 bird flu in outside mainland China, after a 53-year-old man was hospitalised after arriving in Taipei from from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, via Shanghai, China Daily reports. A row in Hong Kong over donations for the victims of last Saturday's earthquake in Sichuan still has not been resolved. Lawmakers are blocking moves by the Hong Kong government to donate earthquake relief funds to the mainland authorities, says Apple Daily. They are calling for the funds to be donated to Hong Kong charities instead to prevent the funds being embezzled or misused.

"The fragile peace in Mohammad Deen's life was shattered on 22 August. ""My wife Noor Jaan had just stepped out of the house to water the buffaloes when a shell fell in front of her. As she turned around to escape it, the second one fell right behind her,"" he says. Her body riddled with shrapnel, she's now unable to move. Ever since the attack, the couple's two children have refused to go to school. ""They are petrified. They live in constant fear. They ask me not to step out, they think I will get hit too. But I don't have an option. I have to go out to till the land, look after the crops and take care of the buffaloes,"" Mohammad Deen says. The family lives in the village of Keerni in Poonch district in Jammu region. Parts of the village are in Pakistan and the two sides are demarcated by a narrow stream. 'Sitting ducks' The Indian part of Keerni is inside the fence the army built on the LoC some years ago to make it difficult for militants to cross over. Outsiders are not allowed to travel to Keerni so Mohammad Deen takes me to the mountains across the valley and from there points out the glistening metal roof of his home and the Indian army positions. Locked between the fence and the LoC, Mohammad Deen says the 120 families or 600 residents of Keerni are like sitting ducks for the incoming fire from across the border. Before the November 2003 ceasefire, the village was shelled regularly, but since then a tenuous truce brought some respite to the residents along the 740km (460-mile) LoC. Every now and then, the two sides exchanged fire, but this year the firing has been the heaviest in many years. Since January, the Indian army says, there have been nearly 100 instances of cross-border shelling and for the first time since 1999 when the two sides fought a limited war in Kargil, fire was exchanged in the region. India says six of its soldiers were killed and a number of civilians injured. Casualties have also been reported on the Pakistani side and both sides have accused each other of ""unprovoked aggression"". 'People are afraid' The incessant shelling has created an atmosphere of fear in the areas along the disputed border. Shamsher Hussain, the senior-most police official in Poonch, says ceasefire violations by Pakistan have ""gone up a lot in the area, some people have been injured, there has been damage to property and cattle"". ""Shells have been falling once or twice every week. People are afraid, they can't work in the fields, can't take their cattle out,"" he says. Shamim Dar, a social worker from Keerni who lives in Poonch town, says ""people are worried that the pre-2003 situation may return again"" . It is difficult to say which side fired the first shot, but Mr Hussain believes the border has been volatile because the Pakistani army is trying to help militants sneak into Indian-held territory. ""It's a diversionary tactic, sometimes they fire at the army posts to keep them occupied so that a group of militants can cross the border."" Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over 60 years and, besides the Kargil conflict, the reason for two full-fledged wars. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif says he wants peace with India amid expectations that he would meet PM Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week. Predictably, the latest trouble on the border threatens to derail the fledgling peace process between Delhi and Islamabad with many in India trying to dissuade PM Singh from meeting Mr Sharif. Threats from militants The meeting is expected to go ahead and few expect the border skirmishes to lead to full-scale fighting, but many in Kashmir are worried that things may get worse. In recent weeks, there have been threats from India-baiting militants in Pakistan like Syed Salahuddin that they would ""flood Kashmir with fighters"" once the US forces withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014. Although Abdul Ghani Mir, the inspector general of police in Srinagar, says ""whatever comes, we are ready to fight it"", the threats are causing some unease in India. This year, there have been ""some high-profile attacks on the security forces and about a dozen village council members have been killed"", says Tahir Mohiuddin, chief editor of Srinagar-based Urdu newspaper Chattan. ""The situation is not as bad as it was at the peak of militancy in the 1990s, but after the quiet of the last few years, it appears the militants are regrouping and trying to revive militancy,"" he says. In recent years, the two decade-long insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir, backed by Pakistan, has waned. And over the last decade, Delhi and Islamabad have worked on confidence-building measures by easing visa restrictions and allowing trade and people-to-people contacts. 'Leaves of the same tree' Poonch has been a big beneficiary of improved ties - in 2006, cross-border trade and travel was allowed and a weekly bus service was started between Poonch and the Pakistani town of Rawalakot. But the renewed tension has the people here worried and not without reason. In January, the crossing was shut for a fortnight after India accused Pakistan of killing two soldiers. On a Monday morning in September, families are gathering at Poonch stadium to take the bus to Rawalakot to meet relatives. Some are here to see off relatives visiting from Pakistan. Sixty-four-year-old Mohammad Ayub, who left India in 1965 and lives in Rawalpindi, arrived in Poonch on 29 July to visit his sister and her family. ""We are all leaves of the same tree,"" he says, surrounded by sister Aleema Bi, her family and other relatives. ""The Poonch-Rawalakot bus has made our lives a lot easier. We are very unhappy over the renewed tension. It will be very sad if the bus service is suspended because of shelling,"" he says. Standing near him, Aleema Bi begins to weep. ""He left a long time ago. I've seen him after many years, who knows whether we'll be able to meet again,"" she says. Mohammad Nazir, Mr Ayub's nephew, sums up the sentiment well. ""It is usually hard to say goodbye. For us, it is harder for who knows what tomorrow may bring?""","Ten years after India and Pakistan agreed a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) that divides Kashmir between the two countries, mortars and shells are once again being exchanged on the disputed border.

"Instead, he said officials would obtain the information through an executive order for government agencies, as court challenges would have delayed a census. The retreat follows a long fight over the inclusion of the question, which the Supreme Court blocked in June. Critics called the question politically motivated and said it would lead to fewer immigrant households taking part. The administration had argued that the question would bolster protections for minority voters. Thursday's reversal was celebrated by Democrats and civil liberties groups, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying she was ""jubilant"". What happens now? On Thursday, Mr Trump said: ""We are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population."" ""We will leave no stone unturned."" He said his executive order would require other government agencies to provide the Census Bureau with documents regarding citizenship. ""As a result of today's executive order we will be able to ensure the 2020 census generates an accurate count of how many citizens, non-citizens and illegal aliens are in the United States of America,"" Mr Trump said at the White House. Is this a new idea? Not really - it is similar to plans that were announced last year. Back in January 2018, the Census Bureau described taking citizenship information from government records as an option - saying it was cheaper and less disruptive than adding a question to the census. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asked the bureau to compile the data - but also tried to add the citizenship question, sparking a legal battle that ended in the Supreme Court. Kristen Clarke, president of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the BBC she had concerns about Mr Trump's plans. ""This is essentially an attempt to compile data on a mass scale in a way that is unprecedented,"" she said. ""We don't know how long it will take for them to pull this data together, we don't know what they will do with that data."" How did we get here? The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the citizenship question in June, saying that the government's reason for including the question seemed ""contrived"", and it had not provided adequate justification for it. It left open the possibility that the government could provide new legal arguments for the question to a lower court - however, this would have delayed the census. The government began printing the 2020 census last week without the question - but Mr Trump then created confusion when he announced that he would do ""whatever is necessary"", including potentially an executive order, to include the question in the census. Legal experts however noted that an executive order could not override a Supreme Court ruling. On Thursday, Attorney General William Barr said the decision to abandon the citizenship question was a ""logistical impediment, not a legal one"". He said there was ""ample justification"" for the administration to include the citizenship question. But referring to court injunctions, he said there was no way to ""implement any new decision without jeopardizing our ability to carry out the census"". Mr Barr repeatedly congratulated Mr Trump on the executive order to gather the data separately. Why is the citizenship question so controversial? The question - ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" - has not appeared on a US census for all Americans since 1950, though it has been asked to some subsets of the population between 1970 and 2000. The government said the question would help the government allocate resources and enforce voter laws designed to prevent discrimination, including the Voting Rights Act. However, Democratic states with large immigrant populations argue a citizenship question will produce undercounts because fewer people will participate if they believe the information could be used against them. In a 2018 report, Census Bureau researchers found that the inclusion of a citizenship question could suppress response rates in households with immigrants and minority groups. Even legal citizens could be afraid to complete the census if it could expose noncitizen family members, media reports say. Critics argued that states with high non-citizen populations would lose congressional seats and funding - even though many non-citizens pay taxes and use government services. On Thursday, Mr Trump said that citizenship information ""is also relevant to administering our elections... some states may want to draw state and local legislative districts, based upon the voter eligible population."" In response, Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project, said Mr Trump had attempted to ""weaponise the census"" to ""sow fear in immigrant communities and turbocharge Republican gerrymandering efforts by diluting the political influence of Latino communities"". The census is mandated under the US constitution and takes place every 10 years, counting every resident. Never one to admit defeat By Peter Bowes, BBC North America correspondent In election year, a question about citizenship on the 2020 census form would have been hugely polarising. For Donald Trump, whose stance on illegal immigration has defined his presidency, it would have been a major success. But it is not to be. The hurdles proved too cumbersome and the administration acknowledged that outstanding lawsuits could delay the completion of the census. But never one to admit defeat, Mr Trump framed his plan B as a ""far more accurate"" way to count the non-citizen population. Officials, he said, would ""leave no stone unturned"", in their quest to dig out citizenship information from existing data held by government departments. That could be seen as an implied threat, but it means the census is likely to result in a more accurate count, with those living in the US illegally less afraid to make their presence known. Census counts are used to determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the distribution of billions of dollars of funds in federal spending. There had been concern that impoverished areas would lose out if a significant number of residents chose not to complete the form.",President Donald Trump will no longer pursue adding a question on citizenship to the 2020 US census questionnaire.
"The latest official tourism figures were up 0.6% on 2010. Senator Alan Maclean, the economic development minister, said it was very encouraging news at a time when fewer people were going on holiday. The figures showed people on holiday and business trips to Jersey spent £242m in the island last year, making the States more than £12m pounds in goods and services tax. The minister said this proved how valuable the hospitality sector was to Jersey's economy. He said it also reflected a trend towards higher-graded accommodation. 'Maximum return' Senator Maclean said niche markets including walking holidays and people visiting from Europe had been particularly important. The figures showed the biggest rise was from mainland Europe, with nearly a quarter more Germans and 10% more French visitors. About 98,000 people went to Jersey on business in 2011, also slightly up on the previous year. Senator Maclean said: ""I think we need to be cleverer in the way we spend our money, we need to get maximum return for every pound invested. ""I think we have to look at online marketing, which has been quite successful, social media, and PR. ""All these areas can target specialist and niche groups which has helped without doubt, to see these figures that we are able to unveil today.""",There was a small rise in the number of visitors to Jersey last year.
"Layers of ash settled on houses and fields on the Indonesian island after an eruption of Mount Agung. Up to 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate the vicinity and thousands of tourists have been stranded. The airport might have to close again if the wind changed direction, officials said. Not all local people have left - some have insisted on waiting until lava from the crater heads their way. The massive plumes of dark ash from Mount Agung were seen reaching as high as 3km (2 miles) above its rumbling summit. It began erupting last week. Officials raised the alert to the highest level on Monday, fearing an imminent major eruption. They said that although the airport reopened from 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT), it remained necessary constantly to monitor the situation on the ground. The authorities have also warned tourists that they are likely to face long waits before returning home because of a huge backlog of flights. Meanwhile Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said that his government is working to help thousands of Australian holidaymakers stranded on Bali to return home. It is estimated that Australians comprise more than 25% of tourists on the island. Denpasar airport is used by millions of visitors each year and is the main entry point into Bali. Airport spokesman Ari Ahsanurrohim said more than 440 flights were cancelled on Tuesday, affecting nearly 60,000 passengers. A similar number of people were affected on Monday. Volcanic ash can damage aeroplane engines or even cause them to fail, and also clogs fuel and cooling systems. Pilot visibility can also be hampered. The airport on neighbouring Lombok island reopened earlier, officials say. The volcano is about 70km (43 miles) from the popular tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak. On Wednesday it was still emitting thick ash clouds in addition to streams of rock mixed with water known as lahar which have also been spotted flowing out of the mountain. Officials have told everyone living in a 10km (6 miles) exclusion zone around the volcano to evacuate. So far, only 29,000 people have moved to shelters, while others have fled to nearby places like Lombok.","Flights have resumed from the international airport in Bali after three days of disruption caused by a volcanic ash cloud, officials say."
"By Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent How times have changed. Their attempts to jointly reform, reinvigorate and reinforce the EU against the deep currents of populism and the shock of the UK's departure have, thus far, not amounted to much; the German chancellor apparently reluctant to lend her weight to the French president's imagined agenda for Europe. But last week they announced another Franco-German plan. There could be no public display of affection this time as, via separate video links, the leaders unveiled their economic recovery proposal for a corona-ravaged Europe. The EU Commission, they said, should borrow €500bn ($545bn; £448bn) from the financial markets to fund the venture. Unable to stand physically shoulder to shoulder, Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel had, nonetheless, thrashed out a compromise that took many analysts by surprise - not least because it represents a significant shift in position on the part of the German chancellor. How will it work? The German leader has always resisted the mutualisation of EU debt. The idea that richer member states should be responsible for the debts and defaults of poorer ones has not played well in Berlin, where the idea of ""coronabonds"", so vociferously demanded by a number of member states, had ministers spluttering into their coffee. This proposal differs, but still centres on the sharing of debt. The money, which will be doled out in the form of grants, will sit within - and be repaid out of - the EU budget, with each country shouldering the repayment proportionate to their existing contribution to the pot. Germany as the biggest net contributor will therefore be liable to pay back more. Not everyone is happy. Italy says the plan needs to be more ambitious, while four other countries, including Austria, want the aid to be in loans not grants. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will put forward the EU's own proposals on how the recovery fund and a revamped budget might work on Wednesday. So why now? Mrs Merkel's apparent change of heart is an indication of her alarm at where the EU might be headed, post-Brexit. German politicians have been taken aback by the recent level of hostility coming out of Italy and they are spooked by the prospect of populists in Southern European states making gains on the back of the coronavirus crisis. It was no accident that Mr Macron talked about learning the lessons of the financial crisis when he said Europe's response exacerbated inequality and damaged European sovereignty. Mrs Merkel, edging towards the end of her final term next year, is looking to legacy and has made clear in recent speeches that she's focused on getting the bloc into shape. Some say that a recent ruling of Germany's constitutional court may have spurred her on. The court has called into question the future of a huge European Central Bank bond-buying stimulus programme. More on Europe's emergence from Covid-19 lockdown She's also striking while the political iron is hot at home. Her handling of the pandemic has sent her own approval ratings soaring along with those of her party. And, as Mrs Merkel is fond of repeating, ""Germany only prospers when the EU prospers."" How are Germans reacting? The Franco-German proposal has gone down well with the domestic audience. Public surveys suggest Germans have warmed to the idea. It helps that, as the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research has noted in interviews, Germany wouldn't be directly responsible were another state to go bankrupt, and that this plan does not represent joint liability. There's been remarkably little bite-back politically, with even her hawkish former Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble reportedly giving the plan the thumbs-up. Coronavirus has changed a great deal here, with politicians recently agreeing to abandon a long-cherished principle of not taking on new debt in order to finance a domestic economic rescue package. Not that the fully developed plans won't be closely scrutinised. Katja Leikert, the deputy chair of Mrs Merkel's CDU-CSU parliamentary group, welcomed the initiative as ""a significant political gesture to help rebuild political trust on the future of Europe"". But crucially, given that the money would be disbursed as grants to regions and industries deemed to be most affected by the crisis, Ms Leikert says that ""conditionality will also be very important"". She says, for example, that the fund should be used to ""enable future investments... in digitalisation or transformation to a sustainable economy"". And while she notes that among voters she finds ""huge support for European solutions in the time of the crisis"", Ms Leikert adds that this is limited and says ""we have to make sure that increased public spending on the European level will create a European added value"". Why a hard sell lies ahead Europe's so-called ""frugal four"" continue to object to the plan, concerned that it might set a future precedent. The leaders of Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands may have heard Mrs Merkel say this was a one-off instrument for extraordinary times but, publicly at least, they don't believe her. They'll be under huge pressure to fall in, now that the bloc's two weightiest members have agreed on a plan that co-ordinates beautifully - some would say suspiciously so - with the wishes of Ursula von der Leyen. It was no accident that, before Covid-19's deathly advance across the medieval courtyards and traffic-clogged avenues of Europe, Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron chose to hold that summit in Aachen. Nearby, in its cathedral, lie the remains of Charlemagne, the warrior king who first united - not always diplomatically - much of what we recognise as Europe today. Having been apparently content to simply invoke an ancient ghost last year, it could be that finally France and Germany are together ready for action.","Last year, in the sumptuous setting of Aachen's historic town hall, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron signed a treaty. The leaders promised to co-operate more closely and to re-fire the political and economic heart of the EU, sealing the deal with a kiss for the cameras."
"The desire for fairer skin is not new in India and for centuries, fair complexion has been considered superior. Fairness creams are among the highest selling cosmetic products in the country and top Bollywood actors and actresses regularly appear in commercials endorsing fairness products. In recent years, creams and gels have been introduced which claim to lighten armpit hair and even female genitals, and advertisements encourage customers to believe that lighter skin tones would help them improve their lives by getting a better job or win them love. In the past few years, there have been campaigns such as Dark is Beautiful and #unfairandlovely, calling on people to celebrate dark skin. Yet, the unhealthy obsession with light skin has continued and, as ad filmmaker Bharadwaj Sundar says, it's not just limited to earthly beings, it includes the divine too. ""All the images of the popular gods and goddesses that we see around us, photographs in our home shrines or prayer halls, online, on calendars, stickers and posters in shops and pasted behind auto-rickshaws, all show them to be light-skinned."" In a culture obsessed with fairness, Mr Sundar points out that even Krishna, who is described as a dark-skinned god in the scriptures, is often shown as fair. And so is the elephant-headed Ganesha, even though there are no white elephants in India. ""Everyone here prefers fair skin. But I am a dark-skinned person and all my friends are dark-skinned too. So how do I identify with fair-skinned gods and goddesses?"" To fight this disconnect, Mr Sundar, who is based in the southern city of Chennai, teamed up with photographer Naresh Nil and the two have come up with ""Dark is Divine"" - a project that portrays gods and goddesses with a darker skin colour. They recruited ""dusky"" male and female models, dressed them up as gods and goddesses and shot the campaign images over two days in December and the result is quite stunning. Model Suruthi Periyasamy told the BBC that she had to face too many rejections in the past ""because no-one wanted a dusky model"" and that she was ""thrilled"" when she was chosen to portray Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. ""Lakshmi is the most popular goddess in India, everyone wants a daughter-in-law like her because she brings prosperity so I feel so blessed to be her."" Ms Periyasamy says everyone talks about working with dark-skinned models, but no-one really encourages them. She says she hopes that this campaign will ""change the minds of some people to allow us to shine in life"". Since the campaign was launched last month, Mr Sundar says they have received lots of calls and the responses have been largely positive, though some people have accused them of unfair biases, pointing out that goddess Kali is always portrayed as black. Mr Sundar says he's a devout Hindu and does not mean disrespect to anyone but ""if we look around, we find that 99.99% times, the divine is fair-skinned"". ""Appearance plays a major role in how we perceive people, especially women, and we felt that this needed to be addressed,"" he says. ""And through the Dark is Divine project, we are trying to challenge the belief that fair skin is superior.""","In India where light skin is coveted, a new campaign is re-imagining popular Hindu gods and goddesses with a darker skin, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi."
"Jersey Police are assisting the UK investigation into allegations of abuse in the island by Sir Jimmy Savile. Senator Ian Le Marquand said the inquiry would reopen if any new leads were uncovered. He dismissed claims by a former senior police office that an outside force would need to be called in. Lenny Harper, the former deputy chief police officer who led the inquiry, said the government had too much control and someone was needed with an outside perspective. Mr Harper led a three-year £7.5m investigation into historical child abuse in the island, which heard from 192 alleged victims and identified 151 potential abusers and led to seven people being successfully prosecuted. Five people in Jersey have said they were sexually abused by Savile, but not all of them have yet formally lodged their complaints. On Friday, Scotland Yard started a formal criminal investigation following up 400 lines of inquiry into complaints of abuse and sexual assault by the entertainer who died in October 2011 aged 84.","Jersey's historical abuse inquiry will reopen if new evidence is found during abuse investigations, the island's home affairs minister has said."
"The 68-year-old chief minister of the southern state of Tamil Nadu suffered a heart attack on Sunday night and died at 23:30 (18:00 GMT) on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee are among those attending the state funeral. Her grave is located next to that of her mentor, MG Ramachandran. Ramachandran, an actor turned politician, was instrumental in introducing her to politics. The fact that Jayalalitha was buried is unusual, as members of her caste are always cremated. However, senior members of her party were quoted by Indian media as saying that she transcended caste for her people, and burying her next to her mentor would also give the people a ""monument"" to remember her by. A sea of people joined her funeral procession headed to Marina beach in Chennai. Earlier, her body, draped in the Indian flag, was on display at a large public hall. Extra police have been deployed in the state amid fears of unrest due to the extreme devotion she inspires among her supporters, many of whom refer to her as ""Amma"" (mother). There were concerns that they could resort to self-harm or violence, but crowds have been orderly and disciplined apart from a few minor scuffles. At the scene: Sanjoy Majumder, BBC News From the early hours people streamed into the large public park inside which Jayalalitha's body lay in state, wrapped in the national flag. They converged into the arena from all directions, as the police struggled to control the flow. It was so intense that you felt there could be a stampede at any moment, as men and women surged forward in waves, straining to catch a glimpse of their beloved ""Amma"". Many were visibly distraught. ""Amma why have you left us,"" one woman wailed, while another beat her chest. By the coffin were the VIPs - the prime minister, senior politicians and celebrities. But those below were the ordinary men and women who formed the bedrock of her support. ""We don't know what will happen to us now,"" one man muttered, his voice breaking. Another told me he had come from Sri Lanka. ""I came to see her because she is my mother,"" he said simply. A seven-day period of mourning has been declared in Tamil Nadu. Jayalalitha had been receiving treatment for months and was last seen in public in September. She is revered by many but was seen by her critics as having created a cult of personality over the years. Tributes began to pour in for her as soon as her death was confirmed by the Apollo hospital, which had been treating her since 22 September. ""RIP Jayalalitha"" has been trending on Twitter, while Facebook is also filled with elegies for a woman who is widely respected for managing to hold her own in the male-dominated world of Tamil Nadu politics. Khushboo Sundar, film actress and Congress party spokesperson, told the BBC: ""It's very painful for me. Despite our political differences, I had respected her. We were hoping against hope, none of us wanted her to lose this battle. ""She was a symbol of strength for women like me. She fought against so many odds to make a name for herself in a male-dominated profession like politics. We have a lost a great politician, and a great champion of women's rights."" A senior politician of Jayalalitha's AIADMK party, O Panneerselvam, was sworn in as chief of Tamil Nadu within hours of her death, the party's Twitter account confirmed. Jayalalitha lived a dramatic life, both on screen and off. She appeared in more than 100 films before turning her hand to politics in the early 1980s. Jayalalitha later won control of the AIADMK from its late founder's wife, before leading it to victory in 1991, the first of four occasions she would do so. She was accused of corruption on several occasions, and spent two short spells in prison - most recently in 2014. But a Karnataka high court order in 2015, which cleared her of involvement in a corruption scandal, paved the way for her return to power. Jayalalitha's admirers remain unbowed in their admiration for her and argue she has played a key role in the development of Tamil Nadu as one of India's most economically influential states.","J Jayalalitha, one of India's most influential and colourful politicians, has been buried in the presence of tens of thousands of mourners."
"Tunisia's prime minister, diplomats, Tunisians and tourists gathered on the beach to pay their respects. A one-minute silence was held simultaneously in Sousse and across the UK, home to 30 of those killed. Authorities say they have uncovered the network behind the attack and are holding eight suspects. Security has been stepped up at the beach and many people are still devastated by what happened a week ago, says the BBC's Ben Brown in Sousse. Hotels and beaches are empty as thousands of tourists have already left the country following the attack, he says. The Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid and the British ambassador Hamish Cowell laid wreaths on the beach. The Tunis government fears the attack, which jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has claimed, will destroy its tourism industry, the country's biggest foreign currency earner. Authorities have identified 28-year-old student Seifeddine Rezgui as the gunman who carried out the attack. They have also deployed 1,377 armed security agents at hotels and on beaches to guarantee the safety of people, AFP reports. In March, IS killed 22 people at the famous Bardo museum in Tunisia's capital, Tunis. At the scene: Thomas Fessy, BBC News, Sousse The Tunisian prime minister and several government ministers came, along with ambassadors from the UK, the US, France, Portugal, Ireland and the Netherlands. Representatives from Belgium, Canada and Libya also attended the brief commemorative gathering. They all arrived in silence, lay wreaths of flowers in front of the plaque erected at the scene of the attack, before two trumpets gave a solemn salute. Dozens of tourists had come to pay their respects too. Most of them attended in their swimsuits and beach towels wrapped around their waist. The smell of sun cream floating around was a strange reminder of the 38 people who were killed here, most of them lying on sun beds, enjoying some relaxing holiday time. Dignitaries left without a word while tourists and Tunisians - some of whom were hotel staff - formed a human chain holding hands around the flowers that were laid in the sand throughout the morning. Background and analysis",A special ceremony has been held in the Tunisian resort of Sousse to remember the 38 people killed in an Islamist attack a week ago.
"China relies on New Zealand for almost all its imports of milk powder. Imports are highly prized in China after a tainted milk formula scandal in 2008 killed six babies and made some 300,000 infants ill. New Zealand's trade minister described Beijing's decision as ""appropriate"". Fonterra's announcement that it had found the contamination led to a global recall of up to 1,000 tonnes of dairy products across seven countries, including China. The potentially tainted products included infant milk formula, sports drinks, protein drinks and other beverages. Botulism is one of the most dangerous forms of food poisoning, often leading to paralysis. The bacteria was found in three batches of Fonterra's whey protein used in infants' Nutricia Karicare follow-on formula, Fonterra said. Nearly 80% of dairy products imported by China come from New Zealand, according to state media. Any prolonged ban of imports could well lead to a dairy shortage in China, the BBC's Martin Patience reports from Beijing. 'Blanket protection' New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said China's action was ""entirely appropriate"". He said: ""It's better to do blanket protection for your people then wind it back when we, our authorities, are in a position to give them the confidence and advice that they need."" The Chinese authorities named four domestic companies that have imported potentially contaminated products from New Zealand. According to state media, these companies have begun a recall. The whey product was produced in May last year, with a dirty pipe at one of Fonterra's processing plants in Waikato responsible for the contamination, the company said. Fonterra, the fourth largest dairy company in the world, said it had urged its customers to urgently check their supply chains. The countries affected besides New Zealand and China include Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia. Russia is also reported to have begun a recall of Fonterra products. Fonterra said there had been no reports of any illness linked to the affected whey product. The dairy industry powers New Zealand's economy, with the country exporting up to 95% of its milk.","China has banned all imports of milk powder from New Zealand after its main dairy exporter, Fonterra, found a bacterial strain in some of its products that can cause botulism."
"The rapper, whose legal name is Carlton Weekly, was shot by four people who emerged from two cars at 16:30 local time (22:30BST) on Tuesday, then fled. The shooting occurred in the Gold Coast area, a luxury and boutique shopping district near the city's downtown. Police say the city's murder rate has risen 152% over last year. A man and woman who were with Weekly, 26, were also hit by gunfire and taken to hospital for treatment, police say. Police have closed off the street to investigate, and are reviewing security camera footage to try to identify the attackers, who are still at large. Gun violence is normally rare in this region of the city, which is near Chicago's famed Magnificent Mile district. Weekly rose in prominence in 2018 with his hit single, ""Slide"", which was remixed by 21 Savage, and got his start in Chicago's drill music scene in 2013, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. He released four records in the last five years, and countless solo singles with his Fly Boy Gang rap crew, Pitchfork reported. Student anti-violence group GoodKids MadCity mourned his death on Twitter. The glass on a Dolce and Gabbana storefront was shattered during the attack, pictures from the scene show. Chicago community activist Ja'Mal Green said he had heard from friends of Weekly that he was emerging from a Saks Fifth Avenue when he was attacked. ""He was pretty popular and, at the end of the day, there are going to be a lot of people angry at this,"" Mr Green told the Sun-Times. ""A lot of young people are going to lose hope because he was an idol. It's going to take the city a large effort to help young people cope with this loss."" Like in other American cities, crime has risen under coronavirus lockdown in Chicago and following protests against the police after the death of George Floyd. In June, the city reported its deadliest day in 30 years.",A Chicago rapper known as FBG Duck has been killed in an upscale retail shopping district as the city reels from above average levels of violence.
"Essam Koshak and Ahmed al-Musheikhis were summoned for questioning by police in Mecca and Qatif last week. Officials have not disclosed the reasons for the detentions. But HRW said they ""fit a pattern of ongoing repression"" against peaceful advocates and dissidents, at least 25 of whom have been convicted since 2011. Many have been handed sentences as long as 10 or 15 years after being found guilty of charges including ""breaking allegiance with the ruler"", ""sowing discord"", ""inciting public opinion"", ""setting up an unlicensed organisation"", and violating the cybercrime law. 'Relentless persecution' Mr Koshak was detained after being summoned for interrogation by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Mecca on 8 January. The 45-year-old was not allowed to appoint a lawyer and was being questioned about his Twitter account, which he mainly used to tweet about human rights issues, according to Amnesty. Mr Musheikhis, a founding member of the unregistered Adala Centre for Human Rights, was telephoned by CID officers and told to report to a police station in Qatif, in Eastern Province, on 5 January. He was subsequently transferred to the city of Dammam, where he remains in custody. Amnesty said the 46-year-old was known for his work including helping relatives of those detained in Eastern Province as part of protests by members of the kingdom's Shia Muslim minority against what they say is discrimination against them by the Sunni-led government. Mr Musheikhis' brother, Yussuf, was sentenced to death in January 2016 after being convicted of offences including ""armed rebellion against the ruler"". Amnesty said Yussuf al-Musheikhis was convicted after a grossly unfair trial at which he claimed he was tortured into ""confessing"". Amnesty said another activist, Issa al-Nukheifi, had been detained in Mecca since 18 December after being summoned for questioning about his tweets. ""Saudi Arabia's relentless persecution of human rights defenders is a blatant campaign aimed at deterring them from speaking about the human rights situation in the country and working on behalf of victims of violations,"" said Lynn Maalouf of Amnesty's Beirut office. The Saudi government has in the past insisted that its judiciary is independent, and that all trials are transparent and in line with Islamic law. HRW also reported on Tuesday that the Saudi authorities had recently banned Jamal Khashoggi, one of the country's most prominent journalists, from publishing any of his writings in the country.","The authorities in Saudi Arabia have arrested two human rights activists so far this year, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say."
"The wooden structure was burnt to the ground during the fire at the Curraghs Wildlife Park on 25 April. Two of the four Alaotran Gentle Lemurs, a critically endangered species, were rescued by keepers but the two younger animals were found dead. Park manger Kathleen Graham said: ""Replacement plans have already been drawn up for a new metal enclosure."" She added: ""The two surviving lemurs are currently being cared for in the park hospital but they will soon need to be outside again, we need to move forward. ""It's been a very difficult time and the lemur keepers in particular have been devastated, but there are other animals to look after so we have had to pick ourselves up very quickly."" The newly-built lemur enclosure had housed four lemurs - a breeding pair and two offspring, Georgia and Nina. They were aged three and one respectively. ""We think the older pair ran out of the enclosure when the fire started whereas the younger pair went up into the trees and later succumbed to the smoke,"" said Ms Graham. ""Members of the public have been very supportive with their messages of support, gifts and offers of financial help. ""Hundreds of pounds have already been donated by members of the public through our charity. ""It's been very humbling and it will all go towards the new building, which will probably be made of metal this time."" Alaotran Gentle Lemurs are on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) critically endangered list and are threatened with extinction. It is thought there are less than 2,500 of the animals left, primarily in a small region of their native Madagascar.",A lemur enclosure destroyed in a fire at a wildlife park on the Isle of Man will be rebuilt later this year.
"Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh left Vietnam on Wednesday to fly to Houston, Texas, immediately after her early morning release. In 2017, she was sentenced to 10 years in jail for distributing propaganda against the state. Vietnam's one-party communist regime frequently jails its critics. Arriving at Houston airport, she told a crowd of supporters she would ""never keep silent"" in her fight for democracy in Vietnam. News that Ms Quynh had been released on Wednesday emerged soon after US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis left Vietnam after a short visit. It is unclear if he pressed for her release and the Pentagon is yet to comment. Rights groups welcomed the activist's release but warned that freedom of speech in the country remained severely limited. ""This good news, which comes as a relief after two years behind bars, should also be a reminder of Vietnam's worsening record of jailing anyone who criticises the regime,"" Nicholas Bequelin of Amnesty International said in a statement. ""While Mother Mushroom is no longer imprisoned, the condition for her release was exile and there are over one hundred people languishing in jail because they peacefully spoke their mind - in public, on blogs or on Facebook."" Even as Ms Quynh was released, another Vietnamese activist, Nguyen Dinh Thanh, was sent to jail for seven years on Wednesday for spreading ""anti-state materials"". He had produced leaflets encouraging workers to protest against a law on special economic zones that was delayed after mass demonstrations in June. Who is Mother Mushroom? The activist started a blog in 2006 raising awareness of social injustice and pointing out political and environmental concerns. Her unusual moniker is based on the nickname ""mushroom"" for her youngest daughter. She also co-founded the Network of Vietnamese Bloggers, an independent writers' association. With the growing importance of social media, the internet has become a vital platform for dissidents in a country which tightly controls its media. In 2015, Mother Mushroom received an award from the Sweden-based Civil Rights Defenders and in 2017 was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US state department.",The high-profile Vietnamese dissident and writer known as Mother Mushroom has arrived in the US with her children and mother after being released from jail.
"By Nick CaistorRegional analyst Mr Jean, who became internationally famous with the group The Fugees, was born 37 years ago in the Haitian town of Croix-des-Bouquet, although he left for the US as a child. Registering his candidacy on Thursday in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, Mr Jean stressed he was not the candidate of Haiti's diaspora, and felt completely Haitian. ""I have my electoral card and voted in the last elections five years ago,"" he told reporters. He will not be the only singer in the race. Michel Martelly, known as Sweet Micky, is famous in Haiti and is to stand for the Repons Peyizan (Peasants' Response) grouping. Like Mr Jean, he insists that the main challenges facing Haiti, apart from reconstruction after this year's devastating earthquake in which about 230,000 people died, are to educate its youth and to improve the health system. Meanwhile, the governing Inite (Unity) party sprung a last-minute surprise; before registration ended on Saturday, they chose Jude Celestin, head of the government's main construction company, instead of endorsing former Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis. The chairman of the Inite party Joseph Lambert gave no reason for the refusal to back Mr Alexis - who immediately announced he would stand for a different party, the Mobilization for Haitian Progress. Among the other candidates for the presidency is another former prime minister, Yvon Neptune. As the last head of government under President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in 2004, he hopes to win the backing of the many supporters of Aristide's Lavalas movement. Other candidates include the mayors of several Port-au-Prince neighbourhoods, and Leslie Voltaire, the present government's reconstruction planning minister. Observers in Haiti have criticised the calling of these presidential and legislative elections in November with more than a million Haitians still living in camps and temporary shelters. Little of the rubble has been cleared from the capital Port-au-Prince and other stricken cities, and normal life is only slowly returning to the streets. The headquarters of the Provisional Electoral Council was destroyed in the 12 January earthquake, and one-fifth of the officials charged with supervising elections were either killed or missing. But the international community has insisted that the elections go ahead as scheduled. Donors have been reluctant to disburse the $5.3bn (3.2bn) pledged to help relief and reconstruction efforts in Haiti until President Rene Preval has left office. Mr Preval, who is barred by the constitution from standing again in these elections, has seen his popularity slide because of a perceived lack of leadership in the wake of January's earthquake. The US has directly criticised his performance. Richard Lugar, the senior Republican senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has written: ""President Preval's actions do not suggest a departure from the self-destructive political behaviour that has kept Haiti the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere."" At first, Mr Preval appeared reluctant to leave power before next year, but at a press conference in July he told reporters: ""It is vital for me when I leave there is an elected president, an elected parliament."" In addition to the presidential contest, legislative elections will be held to replace all of the 99-member Chamber of Deputies and one third of Haiti's senate seats. Preparation for the polls is being carried out with the help of the regional Organization of American States. OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza has expressed confidence that, despite the massive disruption due to the earthquake, more than four million new electoral cards can be handed out. Mr Insulza told a donor meeting in early June that the OAS would be working with the UN and Haitian officials to make sure the vote is conducted smoothly. Some 150 observers from the OAS and the Caribbean community group Caricom are expected to observe the election.

"By Roland HughesBBC News, Washington DC So what is the basis for the right to bear arms? And what key events have helped shape the debate? The very beginning 15 December 1791 It makes sense to start with the date the Second Amendment to the US constitution was ratified. Here, 27 simple words set the path to gun ownership in the US. ""A well regulated militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" The fact that the sentence does not make grammatical sense has only added fuel to the debate about what its true meaning is. Is the key part ""a well regulated militia"" - meaning that only people who belong to a militia should be armed? And if so, what constitutes a militia in the modern day? In 1791 it represented a group that armed itself against the British army. Is the key part instead ""the people""? And if so, who are ""the people""? It's clear which part of the amendment gun enthusiasts see as most relevant - a sign in the lobby of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Museums in Virginia cuts off the first 13 words and says only: The Revolt at Cincinnati 21-22 May 1977 The NRA today is a powerful pro-gun lobbying group that fiercely resists gun control efforts and says it has five million members. It wasn't always the case. The organisation was co-founded by a former New York Times reporter, William C Church, in 1871 to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis"". It was set up by former Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War who had been shocked at the poor level of marksmanship of their fellow Union fighters compared with their Confederate rivals (its first president was Gen Ambrose Burnside, whose facial hair inspired the term ""sideburns""). Much of its activity before the late 1970s involved hunting and organising shooting competitions. But a shift began to happen in the 1960s and 70s due in part to rising crime rates and a growing conservative movement, at the time the NRA was keen to move away from lobbying. ""An increasing proportion of members were buying guns for self-protection,"" Adam Winkler writes in his book Gunfight: The Battle Over The Right To Bear Arms In America. ""The leadership of the NRA didn't understand the importance of this shift and decided that the organization should recommit itself to hunting and recreational shooting."" The result was that during the NRA's annual meeting in Ohio, more conservative elements of the group staged a surprise coup in what's become known as The Revolt in Cincinnati. They were led by Harlon Carter, the head of the NRA's lobbying arm who had once been jailed for shooting dead a Mexican teenager. After a fraught meeting that lasted until 04:00, the NRA's leadership was voted out and the group's new direction as a fierce opponent to gun control was set. What are an individual's rights? 26 June 2008 One of the most significant recent developments in recent US gun law came thanks to a security guard in Washington DC. The district had some of the strictest gun control laws in the US, barring individuals from keeping a gun in the home. But Dick Heller wanted to be able to take his work gun home to the high-crime area in which he lived. His case - backed not by the NRA but by a group of libertarian lawyers - went all the way up to the US Supreme Court. The debate focused closely on what those 27 words in the Second Amendment meant in a 21st Century context. Is it OK for an individual to own a gun if they're not technically in a militia? Five of the justices thought the DC law should be struck down, and four dissented. A whole new interpretation of the Second Amendment was drawn. In his majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote: ""There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms."" ""This is a great moment in American history,"" NRA chief Wayne LaPierre said after the ruling on 26 June 2008. ""Our founding fathers wrote and intended the Second Amendment to be an individual right. The Supreme Court has now acknowledged it."" While gun sales had already been on the rise in the US for some time, they started to increase significantly in the wake of the DC vs Heller case - in the month the ruling was made, almost 820,000 FBI background checks were conducted; in the same month a year later, there were almost 970,000. It's worth noting though that the Supreme Court added some caveats. Justice Scalia wrote: ""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" The court's opinion, he said, did not mean ""longstanding prohibitions"", such as ""the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings"" were now lifted. #NeverAgain? 14 February 2018 Only time will tell whether the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, is a true turning point in the debate about guns in the US. But it helped galvanise a new gun control movement driven by young people - one that is not necessarily calling for an end to guns, but for compromise and change. Students who survived the attack that killed 17 people have demanded an end to gun violence in schools. Their pleas helped bring about a federal ban on ""bump stocks"", modifications that enabled semi-automatic rifles to shoot more rounds per minute. And Parkland survivors continue to be some of the most prominent young voices for change on gun regulation. Other mass shootings have led to change in some states. After the killing of 26 people in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, some states enforced better background checks (the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, however, said more states loosened gun restrictions in the year after the attack). When 58 people were shot dead in Las Vegas in October 2017 - the worst mass shooting in modern US history - Massachusetts banned bump stocks. So what may happen now? ""In Newtown, the students were so young they couldn't stand up, but trust me - we are going to be the change,"" Parkland survivor Alex Wind told the BBC.","It's one of the most divisive issues in American society, once again brought to the fore because of a deadly mass shooting."
"The boat grounded on Saturday near Mangrove Cay, Andros Island, in heavy seas caused by Tropical Storm Isaac. Officials have ordered a search of the nearby waters as they fear more migrants may have been on board and could have drowned. In June, 11 Haitians died when their boat capsized off the Bahamas. The survivors told officials at least 170 people had been aboard the boat. They said they had left Cap-Haitien, in Haiti, on 18 August. Doctors said the migrants were in good health, except for some who showed signs of dehydration. It is not clear whether they were heading to the Bahamans or if their final destination was the United States. Fatal accidents at sea involving migrants from Haiti, the Western hemisphere's poorest nation. are not uncommon. In December, 38 migrants were found dead after their boar sank just off the eastern tip of Cuba. And in 2009, US Coast Guard officials called off their search for about 70 migrants from Haiti whose boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands.",Immigration officials in the Bahamas say 152 illegal migrants from Haiti have been detained after their boat ran aground in bad weather.
"No-one has been killed but scores of people sought medical care after Sunday's quake, which struck four miles from the town of American Canyon. The quake started fires, cracked roads, caused gas and water leaks and left dozens of buildings uninhabitable. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in the affected area. President Barack Obama has also been briefed on the earthquake. 'It was burning' The city of Napa was one of the worst affected areas, where fire-fighters tackled some six blazes, as well as dozens of burst water mains and gas pipes. On Monday, officials said an initial assessment found dozens of buildings made unsafe by the earthquake, including a Napa County courthouse where a 10ft (3m) wide hole showed the offices inside. The Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa reported treating 172 people, although many were for minor injuries. One adult is still in critical condition, while a 13-year-old boy is in serious condition after being hit by debris from a fireplace. Several residences in a mobile home park were destroyed by a fire caused by the quake. ""There were some explosions, and it was burning. Everybody was out in the street. I didn't get anything out of the house,"" Nola Rawlins, a resident of a mobile home park told the Associated Press (AP). The quake came as many of the region's vineyards were preparing to harvest their crop. The shaking broke thousands of wine bottles and toppled barrels. Richard Ward of Saintsbury Winery told AP he lost at least 300 bottles and his grape harvest would be pushed back several days. City public works director Jack LaRochelle said the immediate concern in Napa was the water main system. He said teams were working in 12-hour shifts to restore water, but that the roads were not seriously damaged and bridges were ""in pretty good shape"". The US Geological Survey (USGS) warned that aftershocks of up to 5.0 magnitude were likely in the coming week. It said Sunday's quake struck at 03:20 local time (10:20 GMT) at a depth of 6.7 miles. The epicentre was 51 miles from Sacramento and about 30 miles north-east of San Francisco. California lies on the San Andreas Fault, which forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, two of the large moving plates that form the Earth's crust. In 1989, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck south of San Francisco, killing more than 60 people, many when part of motorway in Oakland collapsed, and injuring hundreds. Are you in northern California?

"It says Mr Kathrada passed away peacefully in a Johannesburg hospital ""after a short period of illness, following surgery to the brain"". Along with Nelson Mandela, Mr Kathrada was among eight African National Congress activists sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964. They were convicted of trying to topple the white minority government. He is due to be buried on Wednesday at a private ceremony, but President Jacob Zuma has said that flags should fly at half mast in his honour and that public memorial service will also be held. Mr Kathrada, affectionately known as Kathy, was not only one of Mr Mandela's closest friends, but also a human rights activist in his own right who had a long history in the struggle against discrimination and apartheid, says the BBC's Milton Nkosi. Kathrada - a moral compass: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg The death of Ahmed Kathrada emphasises that a golden generation of anti-apartheid heroes has nearly gone. Along with the likes of Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu, he was part of a group untainted by corruption, acting as a moral compass for the nation. His generation literally gave up most of their adult lives to fight to liberate black people from the yoke of white minority rule. ""Uncle Kathy"" stayed relevant to the struggle of the downtrodden till the end. He was critical of the current administration, asking President Zuma to resign following a damning court judgement against the president. His significance in the anti-apartheid struggle was also to deracialise it. He proved that the fight was not just left for black Africans to wage on their own, and that is how I will remember him. What was apartheid? Apartheid was a legalised system of discrimination against non-white people introduced in South Africa in 1948. But laws that discriminated against non-whites existed prior to that. Born into a family of Indian origin in 1929, Mr Kathrada was affected by those laws. Why was he jailed? Mr Kathrada spent more than 26 years in prison, 18 of which were on the notorious Robben Island, where Mr Mandela was also jailed. He was arrested in 1963, along with several others, at a farm in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia. They had been meeting there in secret to plan the armed struggle against the apartheid government. The following year Mr Kathrada was found guilty of conspiring to commit acts of violence. Seven other defendants, including Mr Mandela, were also convicted of conspiracy and three other charges. They all received life sentences and most went on to spend the majority of their time in jail on Robben Island. Under apartheid, even prisoners were treated differently depending on their racial origin: White prisoners got the most privileges, followed by those of Indian origin, while black people got the least. Mr Kathadra refused to accept his privileges unless they were also extended to his black comrades. In 1982, he was moved to Pollsmoor prison on the mainland, from where he was freed in 1989. After South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994, President Mandela persuaded Mr Kathrada to join him in government as his political adviser. Mr Kathrada left parliament in 1999, but remained active in politics, He went on to chair the Robben Island Museum Council, set up to preserve the prison as part of South Africa's heritage. A life of struggle He was the fourth of six children born in the North West Province, previously known as Western Transvaal. Mr Kathrada was a campaigner from a young age and joined the Young Communist League at the age of 12. He later became a member of the Transvaal Indian Congress, which spearheaded campaigns against laws that discriminated against Indians, and joined their protests at 17. In 1952, he received a suspended sentence for helping to organise an anti-apartheid defiance campaign, with black activists including Mr Mandela and Walter Sisulu. Four years later he was charged with high treason, but was acquitted after a long trial. In 1962 he was placed under house arrest and then took his activities underground to work with the military wing of the African National Congress. Pain 'same as Mandela' Fellow anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has been reflecting on the news of Mr Kathrada's death. ""I'm experiencing the same pain I was experiencing at the death of Madiba [ex-husband Nelson Mandela]. When Madiba passed on, part of his soul was left in Kathy, he was just an extension of our family. ""So, the pain is the same, and somehow it feels like a closure of a chapter in history. ""A very painful chapter, of men and women who dedicated themselves to this country, who fought for their values and principles they thought we'd instil in our society."" South Africa's Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu has also added his voice: ""Ahmed Kathrada was one of those leaders. A man of remarkable gentleness, modesty and steadfastness. ""He once wrote to the president to argue that he did not deem himself important enough to be awarded a high honour."" What happened to the Rivionia defendants? After Mr Kathrada's death, there are only two surviving members of the group who were convicted at the Rivonia trial in 1964. Denis Goldberg, 83, continues to speak out on South African politics. He told the BBC that ""Kathy"" was ""much more than a friend. [He was] a comrade. We faced the prospect of the gallows together"". Andrew Mlangeni, 91, is also still alive. He served as an MP in the country's first democratically elected parliament from 1994 to 1999. Nelson Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994. Walter Sisulu died in 2003 at the age of 90. He was deputy president of the ANC from 1991 to 1994. Govan Mbeki died in 2001 at the age of 91. He served in the upper house of South Africa's parliament from 1994 to 1999. His son Thabo succeeded Mr Mandela as president. Raymond Mhlaba died in 2005 at the age of 85. He served as the national chairperson of the South African Communist Party, he also was the country's high commissioner in Rwanda and Uganda. Elias Motsoaledi died in 1994 at the age of 69 the day before Mr Mandela was inaugurated as president.","Veteran South African anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada has died aged 87, his foundation says."
"By Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Seoul This ancient society manages to combine cutting-edge technology and modern lifestyles with Confucian values and a strict social order. Its new president-elect is no different. Park Geun-hye's historic win as the country's first woman president has led many to hope she will challenge South Korea's patriarchal institutional attitudes about the kind of roles women should play. But she's also carrying a lot of baggage from the past. Her father, Park Chung-hee, was perhaps the country's best-known president, credited with laying the foundations for South Korea's powerhouse economy but accused of doing so at the expense of democracy. His story is also Park Geun-hye's story. When Ms Park was just 22, her mother was assassinated, leading her to take on the role of acting first lady during the last years of her father's time in power. That memory has stayed with many older Koreans, no doubt helping to boost her support at the ballot box, some 40 years later. In fact, standing at a polling station on Wednesday, in the freezing December morning, one thing that stood out was the number of elderly and very infirm who turned out to vote - many of them had to be physically helped to the ballot box. Anecdotal, perhaps, but a sign of how strongly elderly voters wanted to make their voices heard in this election. Opinion polls suggest that Ms Park's support in this election came from those in their 50s and 60s. Ironic, say Ms Park's critics, that it is precisely the generation who suffered under her father's repressive rule who seem most firmly in favour of electing her. And there is little doubt that her legacy has cost her votes, as well as boosted them. It is a quandary she has had to juggle during this campaign. Unable to shed the powerful baggage of her past, Park Geun-hye has had to try and manage it in the face of a divided electorate. That dual notion of South Korea's history - a battle for economic growth versus a battle for democracy - is the legacy of this election too. Both Ms Park and her liberal rival, Moon Jae-in, were, in a sense, ciphers for the long battle between this country's two political camps; its two views of history. Her task now will be to bring those two sides together after a fiercely divisive campaign. Others before her have tried and failed. And her personal history won't make that task any easier.",It is a particularly South Korean trait to encompass both the future and the past.
"By Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Nantes, France The latest opinion poll for French TV suggests the race remains tight as Sunday's vote approaches. Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron - the man who came from nowhere to lead his own, new, political movement into the campaign is still ahead of Marine Le Pen of the National Front. But only just. A little further back comes François Fillon, the traditional conservative whose run for the presidency has been tainted by allegations of financial corruption, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the veteran leftist enjoying an extraordinary resurgence. But the most striking feature of the late opinion polls isn't the tightening of the race, as the two front-runners both drop a couple of points in the rankings. It is the sheer volatility of the electorate. A quarter of those who intend to vote say they may change their minds about who they vote for between now and Sunday. When you consider the huge ideological and cultural differences between, say, Macron and Mélenchon or Fillon and Le Pen that's a remarkable statistic. Follow French vote on the BBC The candidates have one final chance to take advantage of that volatile mood - a television event on Thursday night which is more likely to test the voters' stamina rather than fray the nerves. The format is not confrontational but involves a series of interviews of around 15 minutes which will include an opportunity for each candidate to rebut charges made against them by the others. It all threatens to lack drama but it is also a genuine last chance for the voters to judge the politicians who aspire to lead them. French elections, though, are not decided on television. At least not entirely. Public meetings still matter enormously here, and in the north-western city of Nantes there is plenty of energy in the campaign - even in the last few exhausted days of the first round. Both Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Emmanuel Macron managed to fill the 7,000 seater Zenith Centre on the edge of the city on consecutive days. Mr Macron came in person while Mr Mélenchon appeared in a hologram projected from Dijon, which also appeared at the same time as far away as the city of Le Port, on the Indian Ocean island of La Réunion. That anecdotal evidence of a high level of engagement sits oddly with national polling that suggests fewer people intend to vote in the first round of 2017 than voted at the same stage of the election in 2012. But at the Macron rally I met one voter whose views helped to explain the underlying volatility of the vote. When I asked him why he supported Macron he corrected me. ""I'm telling you that Macron is someone to whom I've listened, someone I want to see as president of France now but I am not a political supporter of his,"" he told me. ""I am a voter. My choice has been made. I don't consider myself a supporter but as far as I am concerned it can't be anyone else as president of France."" That rather nuanced decision, that Emmanuel Macron is the best of the current slate of candidates although not necessarily a fixed political choice for the future, reflects a mood of readiness among French voters to pick a candidate who meets the circumstances of the moment but who certainly cannot count on a lifetime of political loyalty. The best bet for the second round is that it will see Marine Le Pen face off against either Emmanuel Macron, Jean-Luc Mélenchon or François Fillon, with the centrist at the moment the likeliest of those three to win through. But there is that final examination on TV still to come and there is still that underlying volatility in the vote. A maddeningly unpredictable race remains unpredictable to the end.","The end of the first round of the French presidential election is in sight and the candidates have almost run out of time to appeal to the voters. But the voters, it seems, have not run out of surprises for the candidates."
"The scandal prompted unprecedented mass street protests in Guatemala in 2015. It led to the resignation and arrest of Mr Pérez Molina and former vice-president Roxana Baldetti. They are accused of taking a cut from bribes channelled to officials helping businesses evade customs duties. Both strongly deny the accusations. The bribery scam has become known as ""La Linea"" or ""The Line"", after the hotline businesses allegedly rang to clear their imports through customs at cut-price rates. 'Neither corrupt, nor a thief' Judge Miguel Ángel Gálvez, in Guatemala City, said that Mr Pérez Molina and Ms Baldetti were aware of the irregularities and received millions of dollars in bribes. Another 26 people, including former senior officials from Guatemala's customs duty system, have also been charged and will face trial. Mr Pérez Molina has been charged with racketeering, illicit enrichment and fraud. He resigned in September 2015, at the end of his four-year term. In the wake of the scandal, Guatemalans elected a former television comedian, Jimmy Morales, as their new president. Mr Morales, who had never held public office, won the election with the slogan, ""Neither corrupt, nor a thief"". The United States is seeking Ms Baldetti's extradition on drug trafficking charges. Prosecutors in Washington DC accuse her of conspiring to import cocaine to the US between 2010 and 2015.",A judge in Guatemala has ruled that former president Otto Pérez Molina will stand trial for his alleged role in a huge corruption scheme involving the country's customs service.
"Mr Trump's chief of staff said the president was ""on the job"" and ""in good spirits"", but his physician also said he was ""fatigued"". The news comes just over a month before presidential elections, where he will face Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Mr Biden himself and his wife Jill tested negative on Friday. ""I hope this serves as a reminder,"" he tweeted after the result. ""Wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands."" The pair stood on stage together just days ago for a presidential debate. Mr Biden's staff said he would travel to Michigan on Friday as planned for several campaign events. He and his wife have wished the presidential couple a speedy recovery. Officials said the process of tracking all the president's contacts in recent days was ongoing, adding that Mr Trump was considering how he might address the nation or otherwise communicate with the American people on Friday. But he pulled out of a video conference call with vulnerable seniors scheduled for Friday, leaving Vice-President Mike Pence to chair the meeting. On Thursday, the first couple said they intended to self-isolate after one of Mr Trump's closest aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive. Soon afterwards, they too received positive test results. There has been criticism of Mr Trump's decision to go to a fundraiser attended by dozens of people in New Jersey on Thursday, apparently when officials already knew about Ms Hicks's symptoms. Ms Hicks, 31, travelled with Mr Trump on Air Force One to the first presidential TV debate with Mr Biden in Ohio on Tuesday. Some of Mr Trump's family members who attended the debate were seen not wearing masks. Mr Trump has mostly spurned mask-wearing and has often been pictured not socially distanced with aides or others during official engagements. The coronavirus has infected more than 7.2 million Americans, killing more than 200,000 of them. What do we know about Trump's condition? White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Mr Trump was experiencing mild symptoms and he was optimistic the president would make a speedy recovery. He was on the job and would remain on the job, Mr Meadows added. Mr Trump's physician Sean Conley said in a statement that the president had ""as a precautionary measure received an 8g dose of Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail"", which is administered to help reduce virus levels and speed recovery. He was also taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Dr Conley said. ""As of this afternoon he remains fatigued but in good spirits,"" he added. The first lady was ""well with only a mild cough and headache"". Earlier Mr Trump wrote on Twitter: ""We will get through this together."" Melania Trump tweeted that she was looking forward to a speedy recovery. ""Thank you for the love you are sending our way. I have mild symptoms but overall feeling good,"" she said. Mr Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, released a statement late on Thursday, saying the president and the first lady were ""both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence"". White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany - who spoke to reporters outside on Friday afternoon, but without a mask - said she ""had no knowledge of Hope Hicks' positive test"" before her previous briefing. She added that White House officials had deemed it safe for Mr Trump to go to New Jersey, despite the news. According to Mr Trump's most recent physical examination earlier this year, he weighed 244lbs (110.7kg). This is considered to be obese for his height of 6ft 3ins. But Dr Conley stated at the time that the president ""remains healthy"". Mr Trump will also have the best medical care available. America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says a person must self-isolate for 10 days after a positive test. It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida. The Trump campaign issued a statement saying Mr Trump's campaign events would be temporarily postponed or turned virtual, but Mr Pence will continue campaigning as he tested negative. Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive. Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment to help his breathing during hospitalisation. Contest has been fundamentally altered The US presidential election has been turned on its head. That sentence could have been written about any number of moments in a tumultuous year in American politics, but nothing quite like this has occurred this year, this decade, this century. Just 32 days before the presidential election, Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19. Given his age, 74, he is in a high-risk category for complications from the disease. At the very least, he will have to quarantine while he is treated, meaning the US presidential contest - at least his side of it - has been fundamentally altered. The initial implications are obvious. The president's rigorous campaign schedule - which included visits to Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina in just the past week - is on indefinite hold. Trump will certainly have surrogates on the trail for him, but given that he has relied heavily on his family and senior administration and campaign officials for such tasks in the past, and many of them may have to quarantine because of their own exposure to the virus, that campaign operation will be disrupted as well.

"The school is next on the department's list to be re-built, after Les Beaucamps High School, but funding has yet to be assigned to the project. Derek Neale said under the capital prioritisation programme it would compete with other projects for money. He said: ""We're hoping to... bring this next one along in the next few years."" Work on the redevelopment of Les Beaucamps at the cost of £37m began in December and is due to be completed by the end of 2011. Education Minister Carol Steere said if the money for the work on La Mare de Carteret was not found it would break a States resolution made 10 years ago to retain the 11 plus and provide three new secondary schools.","Maintenance for Guernsey's La Mare de Carteret High School may cost millions if plans for redevelopment are turned down, the director of education says."
"In May, a lower court convicted him of culpable homicide and sentenced him to five years in jail for driving over and killing a man sleeping on a pavement. But the appeals judge ruled there was not enough evidence. Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars, appearing in more than 80 Hindi films, and has a huge fan following. It was only when the judge insisted that Salman Khan must be present before the verdict was read out, that the actor hurried to the court in south Mumbai on Thursday, the BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from Mumbai. ""The appeal is allowed and the decision of the trial court is quashed and set aside. Salman Khan is acquitted of all charges,"" news agency AFP quoted the Bombay high court judge Anil Ramchandra Joshi as saying. The prosecution ""failed to establish [the charges] beyond reasonable doubt"", the judge added. The actor, surrounded by his family members, broke down after hearing the verdict, the Press Trust of India reported. He tweeted his thanks to his supporters: Case timeline September 2002: Salman Khan's car runs over five people sleeping on a Mumbai street, killing a homeless man and injuring four others October 2002: Khan charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder - arrested but granted bail May 2003: Court rejects his plea to drop culpable homicide charge June 2003: Bombay high court drops culpable homicide charge; Khan is then tried for rash and negligent driving October 2007: Prime witness, a constable who served in his security detail, dies March 2015: Khan tells the court he was not drunk and his driver was behind the wheel May 2015: Khan found guilty, given a five-year jail sentence Thursday's verdict is the latest twist in a case that began 13 years ago when Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser car veered off the road, killing one man and seriously injuring four others. During his trial in the lower court, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Now the high court has said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who has since died - was not reliable. The prosecution is likely to challenge the verdict, reports say. Khan's clothes stylist, Ashley Robello, met him hours after the Bollywood star was cleared by the high court. Speaking to the BBC's World Have Your Say programme, Mr Robello said there was a ""sense of relief for him [Khan], his family, his sister"" who fought with him for 13 years. 'Respect the judiciary' Meanwhile, #SalmanVerdict has been a top trending topic on Twitter as thousands have expressed their opinion on the ruling. Some have supported the actor, saying the court's order should be respected: But others seemed unhappy with the verdict: And some others resorted to humour to comment on the case:",The high court in the Indian city of Mumbai has overturned Bollywood star Salman Khan's conviction for a 2002 hit-and-run case.
"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent That is according to new research published by the media watchdog Ofcom. But just over half of parents in Northern Ireland agreed that the benefits of their child being online outweighs the risks. The Ofcom findings are only based on 351 in-depth interviews with parents and children in Northern Ireland. A total of 2,343 interviews with parents of children aged 5-15 and children aged 8-15 were carried out across the UK. Ofcom's 'Media Use and Attitudes Report 2019' looked at a number of aspects of the online lives and viewing habits of children and young people. Children in Northern Ireland who took part reported being more likely than those in England, Scotland or Wales to say they had seen hateful content online. Hateful content Ofcom defined hateful content as abusive online material or comments about particular groups of people based on - for instance - their gender, religion, disability, sexuality or gender identity. Almost two-thirds of children (62%) in Northern Ireland reported seeing such content online - much higher than in England (52%), Scotland (45%) and Wales (37%). However, children in Northern Ireland who took part in the research were also the least likely to be aware of ways to report hateful content. According to Ofcom, parents in Northern Ireland were much less likely than parents in other parts of the UK to be aware of, or use, content filters and parental control software. Streaming services Just under three-quarters (73%) also said they knew enough to be confident of keeping their children safe online, but that was a lower proportion that in England, Scotland or Wales. Their research also suggests that just over half (55%) of parents in Northern Ireland believe that the benefits of their children being online outweigh the risks, but that is significantly less than the proportion of parents in Wales and Scotland. The Ofcom report also suggests half of 10-year-olds in the UK own a smartphone. At age 15, almost all children own their own smartphones. As more children and young people use streaming services like Youtube and Netflix, traditional TV watching is also falling. Each UK nation saw a drop in the number of broadcast TV hours that children watched in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018, Northern Ireland had the largest decrease with children watching six-and-a-half hours of TV a week in 2019, down from nine-and-a-half hours in 2018. However, among children aged 12-15, the BBC remained the most used and most important news source followed by Facebook and Youtube. WhatsApp, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram were the top social media platforms used by children. However, Ofcom said that Tiktok and Twitch were gaining in popularity. Their research also suggested that the more time a child spent on social media, the higher their chance of becoming a target of bullying.","Children in Northern Ireland are more likely to have seen ""hateful content"" online than their counterparts in England, Scotland or Wales."
"On Thursday, the announcement that an explosion was recorded near where the ARA San Juan submarine vanished meant that the anguished wait for families of the crew was all but over. For some, sorrow turned to anger. The Argentine navy's report to the relatives could not be concluded because many relatives became frustrated with the spokesman when he mentioned the reported explosion. There were struggles and some family members voiced their anger at him. Even before the confirmation of the explosion, the frustration of family members was boiling over. Elena Alfaro, whose brother Cristian Ibañez is among the crew, said: ""I feel like I'm waiting for a corpse. I feel like I'm at a wake. I also feel time passing and time is crucial. I don't want to bury my brother."" More than 200 relatives, many of whom have come from other parts of Argentina, have been sleeping at the base. It is here that the worst maritime crisis to befall Argentina in decades takes on a human face. ""The mood is bad, very bad,"" the navy's Victor Hugo Duga told local media on Tuesday. ""At the moment there is only anxiety here. It's the worst thing I've had to face."" He said the relatives had suffered three ""hard blows"" in the wait: The submarine not coming back at the scheduled time; when satellite calls turned out not to have been from the sub; and previous noises heard in the area, which were not from the submarine. With the chances of finding the crew alive reduced by the day, the relatives held prayer sessions at the base and were helped by psychologists. But these small breaks in routine do not disguise the fact that this is a waiting game - and despair is close for many. ""There are times when I don't want to be alive,"" the mother of one of the sailors told El Pais via the Whatsapp messaging service (in Spanish). ""It will pass."" The frustration and anger erupted with the announcement of the explosion. While navy spokesman Capt Enrique Balbi addressed journalists in Buenos Aires, in Mar del Plata feelings among the relatives were agitated. Some wept while others tried to provide restraint. The Argentine newspaper, Clarin, reported that a man shouted: ""They killed my brother... They killed my brother because they sent them out to sea (in a vessel put together with) wire"". Some relatives say the navy was too slow to respond when the submarine lost contact with land, and wasted time before calling in international help. The siblings of Cristian Ibañez were among those to express anger. One asked why the authorities were using boats to look for a submarine, and another said the navy ""lost crucial hours"" by not treating the situation seriously enough at the beginning. Ms Alfaro said: ""I don't want to hear how many boats and aeroplanes there are. I want them to tell us where our relatives are."" Some of those who are missing relatives are too young to know what is happening. Beatriz Gambazza, who leads a creche at the naval base, said two of the children there have fathers on board. Read: What happens when a submarine vanishes The search for the sub has gripped Argentina, and people have come to the base to pin messages of support on a wire fence - it is both an emotional outpouring and a collection of prayers. Bishop Gabriel Mestre, who has been attending the naval base, said: ""Prayer doesn't only contain hope - it also includes strength to confront the most dramatic scenario."" In an emotive interview with the Argentine radio station, La Red, Luis, the father of Lt Cdr Damián Tagliapietra, was asked if he had heard anything about his son's status. ""Yes, yes, yes. Finally, yes. They have told us that they are all dead,"" he said.","With every hour, their chances of seeing their loved ones alive slipped away."
"By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Leisang village, Manipur The tiny village of Leisang in the north-eastern state of Manipur made global news last year when it became the ""last Indian village to be electrified"". For decades, political parties have been promising bijli (electricity) - along with sadak and pani (road and water) - in their election manifestos. So in April 2018, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted saying ""Leisang had been powered and empowered"", it seemed that the government had addressed at least one of these three issues. But when I visited there last week, I found the power supply erratic and the villagers neither ""powered"" nor ""empowered"". Home to 13 families - or 70 members - of the Kuki hill tribe, Leisang is just over 80km (50 miles) from Imphal, the capital of Manipur. But it's not easy to get to. The 35km (22-mile) highway from the nearest town of Kangpokpi is battered in places and full of potholes in others. The last 3km (1.9 miles) is a steep climb over a rocky path and can only be navigated on a bike or by foot. In the rainy season, the village is almost cut off, with the path often waterlogged and slippery. There's no school or health facility in Leisang and though residents here have voter ID cards, they are too few to carry any political heft. Village chief Tongsat Haokip says all the other villages in their neighbourhood got power in 2017, but when they enquired, they were told they were ""not in the plan"". ""But no-one ever gave us a reason, so we petitioned the top electricity official in Kangpokpi. He said, 'You're top of our list for next year.' He told us to be patient."" In early April last year, there was sudden activity in the village. First some officials came for an inspection and then over two weeks, poles, cables, wires, electrical accessories and a transformer were brought up. Finally, the villagers were told that they would be ""connected to the grid"" between 5-6pm on 27 April. Lamneithan Lotjem was among ""the 20-30 people"", including women and children, who had gathered at the village chief's house for the event. Tea was prepared, the switch was flicked on, and all eyes were on the bulb hanging from the front porch. Ms Lotjem was positioned right under the bulb when it suddenly came on. Read more from Geeta Pandey ""We all clapped, jumped up and down with joy. I was shouting, 'Light avatai, light ahungtai (Light is shining, light has come)'. Everyone was cheering. Some people were dancing,"" she says with an embarrassed laugh. That night, no-one in the village slept. They all gathered in the only house with a TV set and watched through the night. The villagers were euphoric. ""It was almost like they were reborn,"" says Nehkam Doungul, Mr Haokip's uncle. In the days that followed, many families bought TV sets and many women dreamed of buying washing machines and rice cookers. But the euphoria was short-lived. It's been a year since that day and the villagers tell me that on a good day, they get power for five to six hours. A fault, however small, takes a minimum of three days to attend to and last year, on one occasion, Leisang was plunged back into darkness for three whole months. Senior power department official in Manipur H Shantikumar Singh admits that the village once lost power for three months because they could not get there to fix it. ""It's remote and difficult to reach, especially if there are landslides on the way,"" he says. But he denies that the village receives only six hours of power and insists that there is enough power to supply everyone in the state. Yet on the day I visit, there is no power in the village. It comes an hour later, but the supply is off again in 15 minutes. Ms Lotjem, who works in the fields from 8am to 4pm on most days, says when there's power in the evening, she finishes off the housework and watches TV. ""But it's impossible to plan because the supply is so erratic."" Mr Doungul says rain and high wind always result in power outages and the villagers now joke that ""the light goes off even if a dog pees on the pole"". Power came to Leising as part of PM Modi's pledge in August 2015 to electrify every single village within 1,000 days. In summer 2014 when Mr Modi came to power, 97.5% of India's nearly 600,000 villages were already electrified, says Abhishek Jain of the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). A village is deemed electrified if 10% of its households, and shared facilities like the school, health centre and community hall, are connected to the grid, he says. By that definition, officials claim that India is fully electrified. But, Mr Jain says, a connection does not mean an assured supply of electricity and that's where the major problem lies. ""The government is now promising 24x7 supply to every citizen by end of March, but that is a really distant dream,"" he says. For instance, in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, the rural population gets power for less than 12 hours a day even though some of the villages were connected to the grid more than two decades back. The situation in some southern states and the eastern states of West Bengal and Orissa is better, but the heart of India - Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - remains largely in darkness. In July last year when Mr Modi interacted via a video link with people from villages that were electrified during his tenure in the past four years, Mr Doungal, who represented Leisang, told him that ""we didn't even think in our dreams that we'd get power in our lifetime"". ""The prime minister said if you face any problems, do let me know. But before I could share our problems with him, they cut us off and he moved on to speak to other people. ""If only we could tell him about our problems, I'm sure he would address them,"" he tells me, rather regretfully. I ask him what he would have told the prime minister if he had a chance? His list is long: ""The nearest primary school is 1.5km away and as there's no transport, the children have to walk. There's no street light in the village. My nephew (the village chief)'s wife died in childbirth because she couldn't get to the hospital in time. When her labour pains started, four men took turns to carry her on their backs to the road so she could be taken to hospital. They lost so much precious time. If the road was good, she and her baby could have been saved,"" he says. Adds village secretary Komlun Khongsai: ""We are the forgotten people of India. Electricity is the first thing we got from the government."" After living in the dark for so long, the villagers had hoped that development would follow electricity to their village. Mr Doungal says that since theirs is the last village to be electrified in India, ""it means Leisang is special"" and must be treated as such. He points to a nearby security force camp that has 24x7 power and asks, ""Why can't we be connected to the same line?"" But Leisang's hope for round the clock electricity supply seems like a dream that's not within reach, at least in the short term. Two days after my return from Manipur, as I sit down to write this piece at home in the capital Delhi, the power goes off. It's 11 am, and when I call the supplier BSES to check, I'm told the power outage is to do some maintenance work and that the supply will be restored at 3pm. This is a four-hour unannounced outage. And let me tell you, it's not that uncommon. Leising will have to learn to live with erratic power supply - much like the rest of India.","As India enters full election mode, political leaders are criss-crossing the length and breadth of the country, addressing rallies. The high-decibel campaigns have lots of sound and fury, but rarely address the issues that actually affect millions of people. The BBC's Geeta Pandey is travelling across India to report on some of them."
"Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""brand new order"" could be issued as early as Monday or Tuesday. It comes after an appeals court in San Francisco upheld a court ruling to suspend his original order. It barred entry from citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries. It is unclear what a new US immigration order might look like. Mr Trump said that it would change ""very little"", but he did not provide details of any new ban under consideration. Despite his suggestion on Friday, Mr Trump's administration may still pursue its case in the courts over the original order, which was halted a week ago by a Seattle judge. ""We'll win that battle,"" Mr Trump told reporters, adding: ""The unfortunate part is it takes time. We'll win that battle. But we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order."" An unnamed judge from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Thursday upheld the stay on the original order, has called on all 25 judges of that court to vote on whether to hear the appeal again. Technically known as an en banc review, a second hearing of the case would involve an 11-judge panel, rather than the three who initially heard the appeal. Mr Trump's travel ban, which was hastily unveiled at the end of his first week in office, caused chaos at US airports and sparked protests across the country. Read more on this story: On Thursday, the appeals court said the administration failed to offer ""any evidence"" to justify the ban, which the president said was necessary to keep the US safe from terror attacks. However Mr Trump insisted that the executive order was crucial for national security and promised to take action ""very rapidly"" to introduce ""additional security"" steps in the wake of the court's decision. He spoke as Virginia state lawyers argued in court that his policy ""resulted from animus toward Muslims"". Their challenge focuses on the travel restrictions imposed by the ban, rather than the four-month suspension of refugee admissions. But lawyers for the US government in Virginia wrote that ""judicial second-guessing"" amounted to ""an impermissible intrusion"" on Mr Trump's constitutional authority. The appeals court ruling means that visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can continue to enter the US, and refugees from around the world, who were also subject to a temporary ban, are no longer blocked either. But the ruling does not affect one part of Mr Trump's controversial executive order: a cap of 50,000 refugees to be admitted in the current fiscal year, down from the ceiling of 110,000 established under his predecessor, Barack Obama.",Donald Trump is considering a new executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from travelling to the US after his initial attempt was overturned in the courts.
"The picture in Dabiq shows a Schweppes Gold soda can and what appears to be a detonator and a switch. No explanation is offered and security experts told the BBC it was not clear how the device would have worked. IS-linked Sinai Peninsula group says it carried out the attack, which killed 224 people. Russia has confirmed it was a bomb that brought down the airliner. On Tuesday, Russia's security chief Alexander Bortnikov told President Vladimir Putin the bomb equivalent to up to 1kg of TNT had been planted on board the Metrojet Airbus 321 that crashed in the Sinai peninsula on 31 October. Mr Bortnikov also said ""traces of foreign explosives"" were found on debris from the plane. President Putin vowed to ""find and punish"" those behind the attack. Nearly all the victims on the flight from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St Petersburg were Russian tourists. Russian plane crash: What we know 'Victims' passports' Dabiq - a propaganda magazine for IS - published the photo of what it described as an IED (improvised explosive device). It provided no further details about the device. An article in the magazine claimed militants had been able to bypass the security at Sharm el-Sheikh airport and smuggle the bomb onto the plane. It said initially they had planned to target a country of the US-led coalition, but then decided to attack the Russian airliner because of the air strikes that Moscow launched in Syria on 30 September. The magazine also posted a picture of what it said were passports of some of the victims of the crash. Security experts told the BBC the ""on-off"" switch on the device could have been operated by someone on the plane, in effect meaning a suicide bomber was on board. An alternative explanation is that the device could have had a pressure-sensor and been detonated when the plane reached a certain altitude. Just hours after the crash, Sinai Province said in a statement that it had destroyed the plane because of Russian military involvement in Syria. Moscow has offered a $50m (£33m) reward for information on the Sinai plane attackers. Metrojet is the brand name of Kogalymavia, an airline based in western Siberia. Bloodiest attacks in 2015 linked to 'Islamic State' 13 Nov - Paris, France Gunmen and suicide bombers kill at least 129 people. 12 Nov - Beirut, Lebanon Suicide bombers kill at least 43 people. 31 Oct - Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt Plane crashes killing all 224 on board.

"By Guney YildizBBC News It is even less appropriate now that the party has secured the necessary 10% of the vote to enter parliament, extending its appeal to leftists, liberals, environmentalists, gay rights activists and pious Muslims. ""Kurdish-Turkish, left-wing opposition party"" might be a better description of what it stands for, if a little more unwieldy. Broader appeal It was not long ago that anybody vaguely associated with the Kurdish movement, which included the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), used to be regarded as supporting ""terrorism"". Despite being part of the Kurdish movement in Turkey, the HDP has managed to appeal to ordinary Turks, whose vote in western Turkey was crucial in helping the party pass the 10% national election threshold for entering parliament. Until now, the party's candidates ran as independents in Kurdish-majority areas as the threshold does not apply to independent candidates. But now it has won twice as many seats as a national party. It did not change its moderate message throughout the election, despite dozens of attacks against party supporters and offices, which culminated in a deadly attack on its largest election rally in Diyarbakir two days before the vote. This message helped secure the support of some Turkish voters who may previously have had reservations towards the HDP. Charismatic leadership For the first time, the HDP has MPs in largely secular western cities such as Izmir, Antalya and Bursa, and it has increased its number of MPs in Istanbul. Behind the HDP's dramatic rise is its charismatic co-chair, Selahattin Demirtas, a 42-year-old human rights lawyer who studied in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. He played a very visible role in changing mainstream attitudes towards the party. As negotiations between the Turkish government and Kurdish rebels continued, Mr Demirtas also benefited from a relatively peaceful political atmosphere regarding the Kurdish question. While the HDP took on the role of mediator between the government and the PKK, it is not the rebel group's political wing. Mr Demirtas also adopted a left-wing stance on a number of issues that resonated with Turks in western Turkey. The first hint that his party was becoming more mainstream was when Mr Demirtas won almost 10% of the vote in last year's presidential election, won by Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Women, liberals and pious Muslims Because the party requires equal representation of women for any candidacy, he shares the leadership with Figen Yuksekdag. In the new parliament, 40% of its MPs will be women. Until now, President Erdogan and his AK Party have found ways of challenging Turkey's secular nationalists by attracting liberal and progressive votes. This time, many of those votes went to the HDP. And by championing freedoms for all religious groups, it appealed at the same time to pious Muslim voters, too.","It was never totally accurate to label Turkey's People's Democracy Party (HDP) simply as pro-Kurdish, as they were never a single issue party."
"The film boycotts have been announced in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. The move follows a rise in military tensions between the two countries over the divided territory of Kashmir. On Thursday a group of Indian film-makers, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association, banned Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood. At least one right-wing nationalist politician has ordered Pakistani actors to get out of India. BBC South Asia Editor Charles Haviland says that is not the first time the poor state of India-Pakistan relations has had a cultural knock-on effect. Our correspondent says that Bollywood movies are immensely popular in Pakistan, whose own movie industry, although enjoying a revival, is much slimmer. Big Pakistani cinema chains and screens say they have taken a spontaneous decision not to show Indian films for at least a couple of weeks, or until what they call normality returns in relations between the two countries. They admit their cinemas may suffer financially because of the popularity of Bollywood movies in Pakistan. Confrontation Disputed Kashmir has been a flashpoint for decades and has sparked two wars. Earlier on Friday, Indian villagers living close to the border with Pakistan fled their homes, the day after India said it had launched strikes targeting militants in Kashmir. India said it conducted ""surgical strikes"" along the de facto border. Pakistan denied that, saying two of its soldiers died in cross-border shelling. People from a number of villages in Punjab state were leaving amid fears the confrontation might escalate. The current bout of violence was triggered by an 18 September attack on the army base in Uri in Indian-administered Kashmir where 18 soldiers died. It was the deadliest of its kind for years. Narendra Modi's BJP government, which came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, has been been under tremendous pressure to retaliate for what many in India believe is state-backed terrorism.",Major cinemas in Pakistan have banned Indian films in what they call an act of solidarity with their country's armed forces.
"At the heart of the case dubbed ""Mafia Capital"" was one-eyed, right-wing extremist Massimo Carminati, who was given 20 years in jail. A total of 46 people were put on trial and most were convicted of corruption. However, the judge acquitted all 46 on the key charge of mafia association. Millions of euros were stolen in a scandal that many blame for the poor state of services in the capital. 'Very deep wound' Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi was in court to hear the verdicts, at the end of a trial in which prosecutors revealed how Carminati had paid for the services of a large number of local politicians. She spoke of a case that had left ""a very deep wound in the fabric of Rome, and Romans know it"". One of Carminati's lawyers, Giosuè Naso, condemned attempts to depict the group as a mafia, arguing that it harmed the true fight against organised crime. ""If everything is mafia, nothing is mafia,"" he insisted. ""The ruling is clear - Mafia Capital does not exist,"" Besides Carminati, many of the other figures on trial, including politicians, were given long jail terms: Carminati, 58, has already spent years of his life in jail, and lost his eye in a shootout with police in 1981. He was a member of a notorious far-right group that bombed Bologna railway station killing 85 people in 1980.","Dozens of members of a gang, whose tentacles stretched deep inside Rome's City Hall, have been convicted of corruption after a 20-month trial in a high-security jail."
"Mikhail Popov, a Kremlin adviser, said that deteriorating relations with the US and Nato would be reflected in the updated strategy. Nato said on Monday it would boost its presence in eastern Europe to protect its members. Ukrainian troops are battling pro-Russian rebels in east Ukraine. About 2,600 people have died since fighting began in April. Ukraine's defence minister on Monday accused Russia of launching a ""great war"" that could claim tens of thousands of lives - claims dismissed by Russia, which denies actively supporting the rebels. 'Aggravating tensions' Mr Popov, deputy secretary of Russia's National Security Council, told Russia's RIA news agency that ""the military infrastructure of Nato member states"" was ""getting closer to [Russian] borders, including via enlargement"". Nato's actions were one of the key ""external threats"" to Russia, he said. ""Nato's planned action... is evidence of the desire of US and Nato leaders to continue their policy of aggravating tensions with Russia"", Mr Popov said. There were no details on how the doctrine might change. Analysis - Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent Almost on the eve of Nato's summit gathering in Wales, the Russian government has signalled that it will respond to Nato's plans to make preparations to deploy crisis response forces to Eastern Europe, closer to Russia's borders. Nato insists that while there will be pre-positioned supplies and more exercises in Poland for example, these will not be permanent new bases. But that is not going to cut much ice in Moscow. The comments by the top Kremlin security adviser Mikhail Popov has signalled that these new Nato deployments, along with missile defence plans and the Ukraine crisis, will play into a review of Russia's own defence planning. Moscow is getting its retaliation in first with the stage set for worsening tensions between Russia and the Nato alliance. There are growing questions now as to just how far the Kremlin is prepared to go in seeking to influence the Ukraine fighting on the ground. Nato announced its plans on Monday for a rapid response force of several thousand troops to protect eastern European members against possible Russian aggression. The force, to be made up of troops provided by member states on a rotating basis, would be able to be deployed within 48 hours, Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. Military equipment and supplies would be pre-positioned in member states in the east so the force could ""travel light, but strike hard if needed"", he added. Mr Rasmussen insisted that the plans would not breach the 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act, which forbids the presence of permanent bases in eastern and central Europe. The new measures are set to be approved at a Nato summit in Wales this week. 'Runway destroyed' The Nato security alliance covers 28 member states, including Eastern European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic. It does not include Ukraine. Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk has said that he aims to put the country on the path towards Nato membership. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said such efforts were ""undermining"" attempts to reach a peace deal with the rebels. Crisis talks between Ukraine officials, rebels and Russian envoys ended without agreement on Monday. Ukraine's army has been forced to retreat amid a series of gains by pro-Russian rebels in both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and further south around the port of Mariupol. Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that 15 servicemen had been killed in the past 24 hours, with another 49 wounded. On Monday, Ukraine's army said it had been forced to withdraw from Luhansk airport after it was attacked by Russian tanks. The acting Luhansk region administration chief Irina Verihina told Ukraine's 112 TV: ""Our troops have withdrawn, but the runway is completely destroyed. There's no way planes can land there."" The UN's refugee agency estimates that at least 260,000 people have been displaced inside the country, with most of those affected from eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, more than 800,000 Ukrainians, mainly ethnic Russians, have arrived in Russia since January this year, bringing the total number of people displaced by the conflict to more than a million, it added. 'I can take Kiev' Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has accused Russia of ""direct, overt aggression against Ukraine"". Russia has repeatedly denied Ukrainian and Western accusations that it is providing troops and equipment to the rebels. Meanwhile, a Russian official responded to allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin had commented: ""If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks."" The reported comments were said to be made in a phone call to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, and were reported in Italy's La Repubblica newspaper. Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters that whether or not the words were spoken, the quote ""was taken out of context and had a totally different meaning"". Russia's strained relations with Nato","Russia is to alter its military strategy as a result of the Ukraine crisis and Nato's presence in eastern Europe, a top Russian official says."
"In the first months of this year, nearly 30 states introduced some form of an abortion ban in their legislature. Fifteen have specifically been working with so-called ""heartbeat bills"", that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. These bills are part of a wider movement of anti-abortion measures sweeping the US. Earlier in May, Alabama lawmakers passed a bill to ban abortion outright. And Missouri's sole remaining abortion clinic remains embroiled in a legal battle to keep its operating license from the state health department. If the provider loses, Missouri will become the only US state without an abortion clinic. What are these bans - and why now? ""Heartbeat bills"", as the term implies, seek to make abortion illegal as soon as what anti-abortion supporters describe as a foetus' heartbeat becomes detectable. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says the name is misleading, and that what is being detected is ""a portion of the foetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops"". In most cases, this point is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant. ""We have never seen so much action around six-week abortion bans,"" said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute - a pro-choice group that researches sexual and reproductive health. ""But we now have seen a shift in the composition of the US Supreme Court."" President Donald Trump has placed two conservative Supreme Court justices and, Ms Nash says, making it seem more amenable to revoking abortion rights. ""Because of this, we are seeing state legislatures looking to ban abortion as a way to kickstart litigation that would come before the [Supreme] court, and the court could then roll back abortion rights."" Other legislators are also responding - in January, New York signed into law a bill safeguarding abortion rights after 24 weeks in certain cases, reigniting discussions about the controversial procedure. Illinois is the latest Democrat-led state to protect abortion rights, passing a bill in June repealing a 1975 abortion law that required spousal consent, waiting periods, restrictions on facilities and penalties for doctors. The new measure changes the definition of viability to survival outside the womb without extraordinary medical measures and allows for abortions after the viability point to protect the mother's health. Vermont also passed legislation affirming abortion rights, and Maine's Democratic Governor Janet Mills signed a bill allowing health care providers who are not physicians to also perform abortions. A backlash from business A growing number of public figures have threatened to divest from the states enacting anti-abortion legislation. Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, says Georgia's six-week ban would make it ""difficult"" to keep filming there. Georgia has become a popular destination for Hollywood producers who flock to the state for its generous tax breaks for films. It offers a 20% incentive on productions of $500,000 or more and a further 10% if the film includes Georgia's logo in its credits. Blockbusters like Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame were recently shot in the state. However, Mr Iger said ""many people who work for us will not want to work there"" should the law go into effect. ""We will have to heed their wishes,"" he told Reuters. Earlier this week, streaming giant Netflix said it would ""rethink"" its operations in the state if the law goes into effect. Netflix series Stranger Things and Ozark are both shot in Georgia. But the threats to leave Georgia if the law should take effect are unlikely to be realised in the near future. Georgia's new law - like others in the anti-abortion movement - are intentionally unconstitutional. Anti-abortion supporters anticipate resulting legal challenges and hope the appeals will reach the US Supreme Court to allow them to re-visit federal laws protecting the procedure. As of yet, despite the wave of abortion bans, it remains legal in all 50 US states. Meanwhile, stars including Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Laverne Cox and Alec Baldwin wrote to the governor saying they would ""do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women"". Actor Jason Bateman, who stars in the Netflix show Ozark and in HBO's The Outsider, which are both currently filming in Georgia, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I will not work in Georgia, or any other state, that is so disgracefully at odds with women's rights"". So, how did we get here? The US movement against abortion began in the 1800s, spearheaded by physicians who saw non-medical professionals providing abortion services as both a threat to their industry and harmful to women's health. By 1900, every state had banned abortions entirely - with exceptions granted only at the discretion of a licensed physician. The issue arose again in the 1960s, when women began advocating for reproductive rights. Colorado changed its anti-abortion law in 1967, followed soon after by California and New York. Amid these efforts to return the choice to women, the anti-abortion movement as we currently see it was born, led largely by Catholics and other conservative religious groups. The oldest such group in the US, the National Right to Life, was founded in 1968. Most funding for the movement still comes from religious conservatives - including wealthy donors like the vocally pro-life DeVos family. In 1973, the Supreme Court issued the landmark Roe v Wade ruling legalising abortion in all 50 states. Roe v Wade protects a woman's right to an abortion only until viability - that is, the point at which a foetus is able to live outside the womb, generally at the start of the third trimester, 28 weeks into a pregnancy. What's happening in Missouri? In Missouri, the battle over abortion rights is centred on the state's last remaining abortion clinic, which is in jeopardy amidst a standoff with state officials. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services refused to renew the licence for the clinic unless its physicians agree to interviews about what it calls ""potential deficient practices"". Planned Parenthood, which runs the clinic, has refused, saying it could mean doctors who perform abortions face criminal charges. It won a court order last month to keep the clinic open on the day it was due to close. ""Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" said Dr Leana Wen, president of the reproductive health organisation. If Planned Parenthood ultimately loses the case, Missouri could become the first state not to have a legal abortion clinic since 1973. What will the Supreme Court do? This week, the Supreme Court issued two decisions on an Indiana law restricting abortions, providing a hint at how the top court may respond to other anti-abortion laws. In an unsigned opinion, the justices upheld a state requirement that all foetal remains - whether the product of a miscarriage or an abortion - be either buried or cremated. But the justices declined to revive another part of the law that would ban abortions if chosen because of the sex or disability of a foetus. The court's actions were a mixed bag for those on both sides of the abortion debate. Anti-abortion activists viewed the provision as a step toward recognising foetal tissue not as medical waste but as human remains deserving dignified treatment. Abortion rights groups countered that the Supreme Court precedent does not consider a foetus to be human. The purpose of the Indiana law, Planned Parenthood wrote in a statement, is to ""shame and stigmatise"" women seeking abortions. By not examining the case in full, the top court effectively punted an opportunity to revisit the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent upholding a woman's right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, said his colleagues on the bench would eventually have to act. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says the ruling could be an indication that a majority of the justices on the court are in no hurry to reverse 46 years of precedent. What does the anti-abortion movement want? For Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at the evangelical Liberty University who is a proponent of banning abortion outright, these six-week bans are ""a good faith effort"" to restrict abortion. ""These bills and the pro-life [anti-abortion] movement are not about punishing women for having sex, they are about preserving a human life that already exists,"" Prof Prior says. She emphasised it was not a religiously motivated viewpoint, but one based on science and human rights. In addition to these six-week bans, anti-abortion activists have fought for restrictions on abortion methods, rationales (such as sex or race or abnormality) and trigger bans that would end abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 18 states have laws that would restrict abortion in the absence of the federal law, while 10 have laws that would protect abortion in the same scenario. But some activists are focusing instead on changing infrastructure they view as promoting abortion, rather than seeking to immediately criminalise the procedure. Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, founder of New Wave Feminists, says her organisation wants to make abortion ""unthinkable"". ""We're arguing about autonomy - which is more important, the woman's or the child's? As a pro-life feminist, I believe we have to take into account both."" She is not opposed to the bills, but says her own activism focuses on women's empowerment. ""We know statistically it's a decision made on financial constraints, lack of access to healthcare, things like that,"" she says. ""Let's get to the real root as to why women feel they have to have an abortion in the first place."" What about the other side? Reverend Marie Alford-Harkey says the right to have an abortion goes hand in hand with the right to follow one's own values and morals. Rev Alford-Harkey, who is a Christian pastor and the president and CEO of the Religious Institute, a national multi-faith organisation working for sexual, gender, and reproductive justice, says the notion of reproductive justice, a term created by black women in the 1990s, is behind her pro-choice views. ""It's the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, to have children, to not have children, to parent in safe and sustainable communities,"" Rev Alford-Harkey explains. ""Justice is a very Christian concept, and this particular framework grew out of communities that were not being served."" Rev Alford-Harkey recently began working as an abortion doula, accompanying women into the exam rooms, speaking with them before, after and sometimes even during the procedure. ""I've been asked once or twice if I think God would forgive them and I say, I don't think there's anything for God to forgive. What I think is a sin is that we've taught people that God won't forgive them for doing what's best for their own bodies, their own lives."" What has Trump said? President Donald Trump broke his silence last week on the recent restrictions across the US. Mr Trump, whose position on abortion has shifted dramatically over the years, posted a series of tweets outlining his views, saying he was against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a ""serious health risk"" to the mother. ""I am very strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions - rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan"", he said. The president added that judicial measures, such as his appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had helped to make abortion laws in various states more restrictive. Mr Trump's views on abortion have evolved considerably over time. In 1999, he said: ""I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still - I just believe in choice."" But in March 2016, he clarified that his position was ""pro-life with exceptions"". In May, he tweeted that Republicans must unite to ""win for life in 2020"".",Louisiana has joined a slew of states across the US in legalising an anti-abortion measure that bans the procedure as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy. What's behind the push - and the backlash - for anti-abortion bills across the US?
"Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said his country was satisfied that the deal would contribute to security and stability in the Middle East. He was speaking after King Salman held talks with Mr Obama in Washington, It is King Salman's first trip to the United States since assuming the throne in January. The foreign minister said he hoped Iran would use the windfall from the lifting of sanctions for its own development rather than engage in what he termed as ""nefarious activities in the region"". ""The president explained and affirmed that the agreement prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, has a robust and unprecedented inspections regime that includes inspections of all sites... and that has provision for snap back of sanctions should Iran violate the terms of their agreement,"" he added. Gulf states fear that lifting sanctions could allow Iran to extend its support for militant groups and actions across the region they consider destabilising. The Saudi foreign minister also said assurances had been given to President Obama that efforts would be made to relieve the humanitarian situation in Yemen. The US has backed a Saudi-led coalition's attempts to restore the government in Yemen, in its campaign against Houthi rebels. Human rights activists and humanitarian organisations have criticised Mr Obama's decision to support the coalition air campaign in Yemen, which has killed hundreds of civilians since March, and the naval blockade that has caused severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine. Mr Obama pressed King Salman to ensure humanitarian organisations were given unrestricted access to Yemen, where the Saudis are leading a coalition against the Houthi rebel movement. ""We share concerns about Yemen and the need to restore a function government that is inclusive and that can relieve the humanitarian situation there,"" Mr Obama said after the meeting. 'Missile deal' US-Saudi ties are said to have been strained by Mr Obama's unwillingness to take military action against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, and his support for a nuclear deal that the Saudis fear will ultimately allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. In May, King Salman skipped a summit of Gulf Arab leaders at Camp David, which was widely interpreted as a snub for the US president. The Obama administration has vowed to make certain that Iran abides by its commitments under the nuclear deal and to do everything it can to ""counter Iran's destabilising activities"" in the Middle East once the country's estimated $56bn (£37bn) of frozen assets are released. In an effort to reassure its Gulf allies, the US has been working with them to develop a ballistic missile defence system, provide special operations training, authorise arms transfers, strengthen cyber security, engage in large-scale military exercises, and enhance maritime operations to halt illegal Iranian arms shipments. ""We are determined that our Gulf friends will have the political and military support that they need,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday. Senior administration officials told the New York Times that the Pentagon was finalising a $1bn arms agreement that would provide weapons for the Saudi military for the campaign against the jihadist group Islamic State and the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen. The deal primarily comprised missiles for US-made F-15 fighter jets, the officials said.",Saudi Arabia has said it is happy with President Obama's assurances that the recent nuclear deal with Iran will not imperil the Gulf states.
"Large numbers of police have been deployed, blocking key areas. Police said they arrested about 400 people ahead of and during the protests, dubbed the March of Heroes. The protests have been triggered by a widely disputed election a month ago and subsequent brutal police crackdown. Demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after alleging widespread ballot-rigging. But the Belarusian leader - in power for 26 years - has denied the allegations and accuses Western nations of interfering. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. Most opposition leaders are now under arrest or in exile. It is the fifth successive Sunday of mass protests, with about 100,000 rallying each week. Eyewitnesses said the centre of Minsk was flooded with people. They marched on the elite residential area of Drozdy, where the country's top officials including President Lukashenko live, but were blocked by police. Rallies are also being held in Brest, Gomel, Mogilyev and other cities. However, the Interior Ministry said that as of 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) the protests involved no more than 3,000 people across the country. The ministry said arrests were made in various districts of the capital, and that those detained were carrying flags and placards ""of an insulting nature"". No sign of enthusiasm dwindling Analysis by BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher In many ways Sunday's demonstration was similar to previous weeks. When the march was at full strength the riot police had little choice but to watch on as the protesters filled the streets and waved their red and white flags. The now famous ""Goose for a free Belarus"" was there, a bow tie round its neck, flapping its wings and posing for selfies. Plenty of families came too, determined to enjoy the warm weather. It's on the side streets, and in the exposed moments when people arrive and disperse in smaller groups that the security forces strike. It's not dignified or disciplined. The police, their faces usually covered, launch crude tackles at the protesters before dragging them kicking and screaming into waiting minivans. After five Sundays of huge demonstrations there's still no sign of enthusiasm dwindling or that the threat of violence is stopping people from coming. Video footage showed men in balaclavas pulling people out of the crowds gathering for the start of the march and taking them to unmarked minibuses. Protests were triggered by elections on 9 August, in which Mr Lukashenko was handed an overwhelming victory amid widespread reports of vote-rigging. Violent clashes on several nights following the poll led to thousands of arrests, and details emerged of severe beatings by police and overcrowding in detention centres. This produced a new wave of demonstrations, with weekend rallies drawing tens of thousands. Mr Lukashenko has said he may establish closer ties with Russia, his main ally. On at least two occasions in the past few weeks, he has been photographed near his residence in Minsk carrying a gun and being surrounded by his heavily armed security personnel.","Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the capital Minsk and other cities, in the latest of several weeks of mass protest against President Alexander Lukashenko."
"By Kasra NajiBBC Persian A major crisis has been resolved, for the time being Iran says the crisis was unnecessary, insisting it never wanted a nuclear bomb. But the P5+1 group of powers - the US, China, Russia, UK, France and Germany - argue that the world is now safer. The alternative would have been a military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities - something that could have triggered a regional war, possibly drawing in the big powers. Critics, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, argue that the agreement prepares Iran to become a nuclear power in 15 year. They say lifting sanctions will make Iran an economic powerhouse and will bolster its ability to wage war in the region and cause mischief. Mr Netanyahu has issued a statement saying Israel is watching Iran's adherence to the agreement. Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours are worried For Iran, the nuclear agreement's so-called ""implementation day"" ended more than 10 years of crippling sanctions and international isolation. The deal enables Tehran to become an active member of the international community once again. Inevitably, this strengthens Iran's position in a region where most Arab countries are deeply concerned at what they perceive as Iranian Shia expansionism. Sunni-ruled Gulf states view the nuclear agreement and the lifting of sanctions as a threat and a sign that the West is getting closer to Tehran at their expense. They fear Iran could become more daring in its interventions in the conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. The US and other Western powers are keen to enlist Iran's help in the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) and in the efforts to put an end to the Syrian conflict. But Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are not convinced Iran can be part of either solution. Their stock markets fell sharply after sanctions were lifted, even though a third of Iran's imports come from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Iran will see an economic rebound The lifting of sanctions has opened the Iranian economy - one of the last great untapped emerging markets - to international trade and investment. Iran can now return to the oil market, and is expected to start exporting an estimated 300,000 barrels per day immediately. This, in an already oversupplied market, will contribute to the falling price of petrol for consumers across the world. Iran will also have access to more than $100bn (£70bn) of money that was frozen overseas. However, it can only spend about $30-50bn, as the rest is thought to be been locked into previous commitments. The money may be used to import goods and services to renovate and modernise many of Iran's economic sectors. Already, Tehran is in talks to buy Airbus passenger aircraft by the dozens. The lifting of banking sanctions also means Iran is reconnected to the world financial network. Critics of the deal say Iran will have more money to buy arms and bankroll its client militias locked in wars in the region. Iran-US relations are unlikely to improve Almost four years of direct secret and open talks between Iran and the US - which have no diplomatic relations - helped bring about the nuclear deal. The US and Iran have now removed the most important source of tension between them. But huge problems remain. President Barack Obama has spoken about challenges ahead: Iran is a destabilising factor in the region, threatens Israel, violates human rights at home, and supports terrorism abroad. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is equally suspicious of US actions in the region and its intentions in Iran. He has made it clear that the nuclear agreement is not going to be allowed to open the way for engagement with the US on other issues. And the hardliners around him, including the commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, feel humiliated by the deal. They will no doubt take every opportunity to hit back, with the US responding to their every move. Rouhani gets a boost ahead of key elections Iranian President Hassan Rouhani described the day the sanctions were lifted as a ""golden page"" in his country's history and something that could transform its economy. Mr Rouhani can claim credit for transforming the outlook for Iranians. He was elected on the promise of ending sanctions and has kept it, to the consternation of his hardline rivals. A hardline newspaper, Vatan-e-Emruz, criticised the nuclear deal as ""burying Iran's achievement in cement"" - a reference to the removal of the core of the Arak heavy-water reactor and the filling of the cavity with cement last week. The newspaper was also very clear that Mr Rouhani wanted the sanctions lifted in time for February's parliamentary elections. The polls will be the first test of whether the hardliners can turn the tide in their favour. The president remains vulnerable. Even though the sanctions are gone, Iranians are unlikely to see any immediate benefit before a real turnaround in the economy, which even at best estimates may be a year or two away. High consumer prices are unlikely to come down that fast.",Economic sanctions on Iran have been lifted after it agreed to roll back the scope of its nuclear activities. What does this mean for Iran and the rest of the world?
"A week after Peter - not his real name - arrived home from work with a dry cough and loss of taste, he was taken to hospital, where he died within hours. He had not been tested for Covid. But then, according to Tanzania's government, which has not published data on the coronavirus for months, the country is ""Covid-19-free"". There is little testing and no plans for a vaccination programme in the East African country. It is nearly impossible to gauge the true extent of the virus and only a small number of people are officially allowed to talk about the issue. Recent public statements have hinted at a different reality at a time when some citizens, like Peter's wife, are quietly mourning the deaths of family members suspected to have had the virus. Several Tanzanian families have had similar experiences but have chosen not to speak out, fearing retribution from the government. The British government has banned all travellers arriving from Tanzania, while the US has warned against going to the country because of coronavirus. Vaccine dispute Since June last year, when President John Magufuli declared the country ""Covid-19 free"", he, along with other top government officials, have mocked the efficacy of masks, doubted if testing works, and teased neighbouring countries which have imposed health measures to curb the virus. Mr Magufuli has also warned - without providing any evidence - that Covid-19 vaccines could be harmful and has instead been urging Tanzanians to use steam inhalation and herbal medicines, neither of which have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) as treatments. It is unclear why the president has expressed such scepticism about the vaccines but he recently said that Tanzanians should not be used as ""guinea pigs"". ""If the white man was able to come up with vaccinations, he should have found a vaccination for Aids, cancer and TB by now,"" said Mr Magufuli, who has often cast himself as standing up to Western imperialism. The WHO disagrees. ""Vaccines work and I encourage the [Tanzanian] government to prepare for a Covid vaccination campaign,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's Africa director, adding that the organisation was ready to support the country. But Health Minister Dorothy Gwajima reiterated Mr Magufuli's stance on vaccines, adding that the ministry had ""its own procedure on how to receive any medicines and we do so after we have satisfied ourselves with the product"". She made the comments at a press briefing this week at which an official demonstrated how to make a smoothie using ginger, onions, lemons and pepper - a drink, they said without providing evidence, which would help prevent catching coronavirus. ""We must improve our personal hygiene, wash hands with running water and soap, use handkerchiefs, herbal steam, exercise, eat nutritious food, drink plenty of water, and [use] natural remedies that our nation is endowed with,"" Dr Gwajima said. But this was not because the virus was in the country. Tanzanians had to be prepared because the virus was ""ravaging"" neighbouring countries, she said. Some medics are sceptical about the government's stance. ""The problem here is the government is telling Tanzanians that the vegetable mixture, which has nutritional benefits, is all they need to keep coronavirus at bay, which is not the case,"" a local doctor speaking anonymously told the BBC, adding that people still had to take precautions against the virus. You may also be interested in: Dr Gwajima, the president, and three other top officials are the only ones who can give information about Covid-19 in the country, according to a directive from Mr Magufuli. But in an unprecedented move, leaders of the Catholic church in the country broke their silence recently and warned the public to observe health measures to curb the spread of the virus. ""Covid is not finished, Covid is still here. Let's not be reckless, we need to protect ourselves, wash your hands with soap and water. We also have to go back to wearing masks,"" said Bishop of Dar es Salaam Yuda Thadei Ruwaichi. The secretary of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference, Father Charles Kitima, told BBC Swahili that the church had noticed a rise in funeral services in urban areas. ""We were used to having one or two requiem masses per week in urban parishes, but now we have daily masses. Something is definitely amiss,"" he said. The health minister said that the statements were alarmist. The lack of official data makes it hard to have an informed public discussion. 'Wear masks - not because of corona' But the government is not in total denial as there have been moments when it appears to acknowledge the virus might exist in the country. In January, days after Denmark reported that two of its citizens who had visited Tanzania had tested positive for the more transmissible South African variant of the virus, Mr Magufuli blamed Tanzanians who travel abroad for ""importing a new weird corona"". After visiting two hospitals, Prof Mabula Mchembe, the permanent secretary in the health ministry, said that patients with respiratory problems were suffering from hypertension, kidney failure or asthma rather than coronavirus. But a later statement on the health ministry's Twitter account that ""not all patients admitted to the hospital have corona"", implied that there were some who had the virus. On Friday it was reported on the Mwananchi news site that Prof Mchembe encouraged people to wear masks ""not because of corona, like some people think, but it's to prevent respiratory diseases"". One development that has complicated the government's position is the public announcement by opposition party ACT Wazalendo that one of its top officials, Seif Sharif Hamad, and his wife, had tested positive for the virus. The government has not publicly commented on Mr Hamad's condition, neither has it responded to repeated BBC requests for comment for this article. On 21 January, the day Peter started feeling unwell, Tanzanians were gripped by a story from the north-western town of Moshi. The administrators of a well-known international school had retracted a statement and apologised for announcing that the school would stop offering in-person learning for one of its year groups after a student had tested positive for coronavirus. The retraction came after the management met government authorities in the region, The Citizen news site reported. The school said it regretted the ""circulation of the false information"" and would continue with normal operations. This sense of carrying on as if nothing had happened is what the government has been encouraging, but Peter's wife is gripped by regret, because like other Tanzanians she and her late husband took no precautions to protect themselves. Their lack of caution was perhaps not surprising given that the president and other top government officials have continually stressed ""there's no corona"".","For months Tanzania's government has insisted the country was free from Covid-19 - so there are no plans for vaccination. The BBC's Dickens Olewe has spoken to one family mourning the death of a husband and father suspected of having had the disease. The fear is that amid the denial, there are many more unacknowledged victims of this highly contagious virus."
"By Emmanuel IgunzaBBC Africa, Addis Ababa ""I have been staying here at the airport under very bad conditions because there's nothing, nothing at all,"" 24-year-old Eissa Muhamad told the BBC. Mr Muhamad's series of misfortunes began last April when he was arrested for being in Israel illegally. He had been living in the Middle Eastern state since 2011, having left Niger's north-western Tilaberi region as a 16-year-old in search of a better life. He said he paid traffickers to take him across Libya and Egypt before he entered Israel by foot. Once in Tel Aviv, Mr Muhamad survived by doing odd jobs in hostels and in a sweet factory until April 2018 when he was arrested for being in Israel without proper documents. After several months in detention, Israel issued him an emergency travel document and put him on an Ethiopian Airlines plane, via Addis Ababa, to Niger in November. But on arrival in Niamey, Niger's capital, he was refused entry by Niger's authorities who alleged his travel document was false. ""They didn't want me in Niger. They didn't accept me,"" Mr Muhamad said. After more than a week of being detained in Niger he was deported back to Israel. But Israel refused to accept him and detained him again for several weeks. ""They tied my hands and legs and forced me into a plane back to Niger which refused to accept me again,"" the 24-year-old said. Then the travel document issued by Israel expired when he was stuck in transit at Addis Ababa's Bole International Airport after Niger refused to accept him for a second time. Food handouts That was at the end of November, and he has been stranded there ever since. The BBC has repeatedly tried to contact Niger's foreign ministry and its embassy in Ethiopia without success to ask why their authorities believed the document was false. Mr Muhamad now spends his day wandering the corridors of the departures area, depending on food handouts from people in the airport lounges. ""Sometimes the airline people give me food. It's the same every day but I am grateful to them,"" he said. When I met him, he was having breakfast at an Ethiopian Airlines lounge. Its employees have been giving him food since he became marooned here. He took me to the Muslim prayer room and showed me a small corner where his bags and a small shawl were spread out. ""This is where I sleep most nights. If it's too full, I find one of the seats outside, say a prayer and try to sleep,"" he said, adding that he has had not access to a shower now for several months. ""I cannot stay here. I want to send out a message to [anyone] to help me because I want to move from here. ""I cannot stay at the airport because the airport is not my home,"" Mr Muhamad said. His case echoes that of a Syrian man who spent seven months living in an airport in Malaysia. Hassan al-Kontar posted regular videos from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, which brought him to world attention and last November he was allowed to travel to Canada, where he had been granted asylum. You may also be interested in: ""I miss my home. Everyone loves his or her home. Your home is your home. But this condition here is very hard. You understand? It's very hard,"" Mr Muhamad said. Israel's immigration department defended itself, saying in a statement issued to the BBC that Mr Muhamad had been deported because he had been in the country illegally. ""He is a citizen of Niger. It has nothing to do with us because he was expelled from here and when he arrived in Niger, he refused to co-operate with the authorities. How is Israel connected? He is not an Israeli,"" the statement said. It rubbished allegations that the emergency travel document was a fake. ""The Laissez Passer is a transit document for foreigners. It was legally designed precisely for such cases,"" the statement said. 'Asylum his only option' Mr Muhamad insists that he has co-operated with all authorities - in Niger, Israel and Ethiopia - throughout his ordeal. His case has put Ethiopia in an awkward position. It has always welcomed refugees and currently hosts nearly a million of them. This month it enacted a new policy that gives refugees access to education and work opportunities. But an immigration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they can only intervene in Mr Muhamad's case if he makes an asylum request, which he has refused to do. ""It's all up to him. We care about his dignity so we will approach him to find out if he will change his mind so he can get refugee status here. It's the only thing we can do,"" the official added. But Mr Muhamad does not want to stay in Ethiopia, and says he would prefer to go home to Niger or back to his life in Israel. An Israeli non-governmental organisation working with migrants and refugees said Mr Muhamad's case was similar to that of other migrants expelled from Israel. ""Other migrants deported from Israel with the Israeli travel document have been refused entry to their countries of origin, or other countries en route, because the authorities claim the Israeli travel documents are false, "" the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants said in a statement. ""In 2016 we published a report, Forgotten in Prison, which details the cases of migrants who are faced with the same problem,"" it added It also wants Israeli officials to investigate Mr Muhamad's allegation that he was brutally assaulted while in detention. ""What is required now is that Eissa Muhamad be returned to Israel so that his accusations of brutality at the hands of Israeli immigration authorities can be investigated, and a solution found so that he may return to Niger,"" said Shira Abo, the organisation's spokesman. But until a resolution is found, Mr Muhamad will keep wandering Bole Airport like a ghost.","A Niger national who was expelled from Israel has been stuck at the international airport in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, since November after his home country refused to take him back."
"Mr Bongo said the burning was meant to send a ""strong signal"" to those who still traded in ivory. Conservation group WWF has welcomed the move, saying it was an ""indication of the country's commitment"" to curbing elephant poaching and the ivory trade. Trading in ivory is mostly illegal. Exceptions have been made for ivory obtained legally, for example from animals killed as part of official culls to control local populations. The pyre that was kindled in the Gabonese capital, Libreville, represented the central African nation's entire government stockpile of confiscated ivory, which resulted from the killing of some 850 elephants. Mr Bongo said: ""Gabon has a policy of zero tolerance for wildlife crime and we are putting in place the institutions and laws to ensure this policy is enforced. ""We don't want our children to inherit an empty forest. For that reason, we cannot allow this trafficking to continue."" The stock destroyed amounted to 4,825kg, including 1,293 pieces of rough ivory mainly composed of tusks and 17,730 pieces of worked ivory, the WWF said in a statement. ""We believe this is a strong signal of intent by Gabon against poaching and illegal wildlife trade - at a time of intense poaching pressure in central Africa, where the illegal killing of elephants for ivory is at record levels,"" it added. The BBC's Charles Mavoungou in Libreville says the discovery of about 20 elephant carcasses in April last year in two national parks in the north of the country enabled the authorities to identify trafficking rings working across Cameroon, Chad, Congo and Sudan. Since the elephant massacre, wildlife security has been improved with park guards increased from 70 to 400 and the formation of a special 250-strong brigade of the paramilitary police for the national parks, he adds.",Gabonese President Ali Bongo has set on fire nearly five tonnes of illegal ivory worth $9.3m (£6m) as part of attempts to deter poaching.
"By Rebecca SealesBBC News Of course it's down to #MeToo, the campaign against sexual harassment and abuse that swept through Hollywood last autumn and has since been Googled in every country on Earth. In its current form, the movement began with film executive Harvey Weinstein - or rather, with the dozens of women who accuse him of sexual harassment, abuse or rape. The New York Times printed the first allegations on 5 October, and the mogul was fired from his own company inside a week. Pandora's box was open. Harvey Weinstein denies engaging in non-consensual sex. On 15 October, actress Alyssa Milano suggested on Twitter that anyone who had been ""sexually harassed or assaulted"" should reply to her Tweet with ""Me Too"", to demonstrate the scale of the problem. Half a million people responded in the first 24 hours. A barrage of allegations has since emerged against high-profile men in entertainment, the media, politics, and tech. Many deny any wrongdoing. The repercussions are still in flux, but Hollywood's power dynamics have undoubtedly shifted. That's less obviously true in the world beyond, and begs the question: What's different for the millions of ordinary people who shared their own #MeToo stories? Are the currents of the movement visible in their lives too? How far has the rallying cry been converted into real-world change? Testing 'Time's Up': Who's been helped by those Hollywood millions? One initiative has made solid progress (and spent solid millions) in a bid to make things better on the ground: the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. More than 300 actresses, writers and directors launched the project on 1 January, raising $21m (£15m) in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment, abuse or assault at work. The National Women's Law Center (NWLC) in Washington DC is fielding the considerable admin, matching applicants with lawyers who can offer them free advice. ""We have received more than 2,700 requests for assistance from every state in the United States, and there are more than 500 attorneys in the network who are ready to take on Time's Up cases,"" Sharyn Tejani, director of the fund at the NWLC, told the BBC. ""The fund prioritises cases involving low-wage workers, women in non-traditional jobs, people of colour, LGBTQ people, and people facing legal retaliation because they dared to speak out about sexual harassment,"" said Ms Tejani. Tina Tchen, who jointly leads the fund's legal aid efforts, said the beneficiaries include ""construction workers, prison guards [and] police officers,"" adding: ""There are men who have come forward too. There are some men who have experienced sexual harassment, and then there are some men who are calling, for example, on behalf of their wives or loved ones."" That's unlikely to raise surprise in some quarters. Sian Brooke of the Oxford Internet Institute, who studies gender and sexism online, says the fact that men are often victims of sexual violence was one of the most powerful takeaways from #MeToo. ""One group can be given attention and be taken seriously with regards to allegations of rape, without it taking any of the severity or weight away from another part of it,"" she notes. Has #MeToo helped abuse survivors seek support? From October to December 2017, calls to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network - a US crisis hotline - rose by 23% compared with the same period in 2016. Some abuse survivors have cited #MeToo as a stressful influence, saying it resurfaced the pain of their abuse. Others have reported feeling less alone, saying it encouraged them to address past trauma by talking to loved ones, counsellors, or people with similar experiences. ""It's brought the idea of sexual harassment and assault into the public consciousness,"" Ms Brooke says. ""Even if the discussion around the movement is criticism, you are still bringing about an awareness that this happens."" 1in6 is a Los Angeles-based non-profit group that supports male sex abuse survivors. The group's development and communications director Meredith Alling told the BBC that #MeToo had a rapid, measurable impact on the number of men reaching out to them when the hashtag first went viral. ""We saw a 110% increase in web traffic and a 103% increase in the use of our online helpline service between September and October 2017, and the trend has continued,"" she said. What's being done to create better workplaces? In the US, employers are considering how best to create a positive workplace culture in the wake of #MeToo. Ted Bunch is a co-founder of A Call To Men, a social activism group that promotes healthy, respectful ways of ""being a man"", and says the group has noticed an increase in enquiries. ""Most notably, we have seen an increase in corporations seeking to understand why sexual harassment in the workplace is so pervasive,"" he says. Mr Bunch believes problems can arise because the workplace is a microcosm of society, in which men and boys are sometimes taught to view women as objects, and of less value than men. ""Most men are not abusive,"" he says, ""but nearly all men have laughed at a sexist joke or objectified a woman in some way. Once you connect the dots and show men how the jokes they see as harmless actually validate and fuel more harmful behaviour, they are quick to change."" Has the push to ditch bad work cultures spread beyond the US? One British human resources consultant said she had been surprised by the lack of #MeToo-inspired queries. ""We haven't seen any spikes in the volume of training requests, or the volume of training we're recommending. I don't think it's had a significant impact,"" said Elaine Howell, HR manager at PlusHR. ""We have clients in professional services, manufacturing clients, financial, marketing... It appears to be quite specific to that industry [entertainment]."" Speak to Equity, the 43,000-strong British actors' union, and it's clear they've had a different experience. The union won't give exact figures, but says it's witnessed a ""significant increase in enquiries and case work since #MeToo"". Vice president Maureen Beattie will take on Equity's presidency this summer, and she's keen to get the message out: toxic behaviour will not go unpunished. Or as she puts it, ""If you do something to one of our members which is wrong, unacceptable, we're going to come after you. And we will come after you big-time."" ""These people haven't gone away,"" she says. ""They are under a stone. They are lurking, just waiting for the time they think nobody's looking any more. ""One of the things we're doing is asking people who have been in the business for a long time, people who are stars, people who have clout, to keep an eye out. Not that they have to be trained up in how to help somebody who's been sexually harassed, but [they] can say - with impunity and no danger of never being worked with again - 'Excuse me? You can't behave like that with people'."" How does an online movement secure an offline legacy? The #MeToo most of us know is still a new-ish creation. But it had a life before the viral hashtag. In 2006, black activist Tarana Burke founded the movement as an initiative to unite survivors of sexual violence. Since it morphed from a low-key project into a global byword, she has embraced #MeToo's A-List flag-bearers - but her focus is on lasting change at all levels of society. One of her most telling remarks came the week before she walked the red carpet at the 2017 Oscars: ""If we keep on 'making statements' and not really doing the work, we are going to be in trouble."" Sarah J Jackson, a professor of communication studies at Northeastern University, believes context is the key to anchoring Me Too. ""I wouldn't call hashtag 'Me Too' a movement at all,"" she says. ""I would call it a campaign that is part of a larger movement. So I would call women's rights the movement, and feminism the movement. And I would say #MeToo is one indication of the sort of conversations that need to happen. ""The next step is, OK so now we know the problem - how do we as a global community expand this conversation?"" Through its ""Me Too Rising"" project, Google has charted how awareness spread around the world. While data shows the term has been searched for in every corner of the planet, its resonance has inevitably been greater in some countries than others. The freedom of a nation's press and social media can certainly have impact on that - and it's too soon to tell how the movement will shape countries where it's gained traction more slowly - Japan and South Korea, for example. Karuna Nundy, a prominent lawyer in India's Supreme Court, shared her view on #MeToo's relevance to India, where outrage over sex crimes has sparked waves of public protests in recent years. ""The #MeToo conversations in India are limited to a swathe of English-speaking, internet-enabled people. It's quite a lot in absolute numbers, but small for India. It's added, though, to the huge conversations that were already happening. The idea that due process is failing women, and civil disobedience can be legitimate."" Ms Nundy, who helped draft India's tougher anti-rape law in 2013, says victims are now more likely to be believed. ""I had a rape case yesterday against a leading Bollywood producer. My client is a very young woman; we told the court that she was raped over a period of six months on pain of bodily harm. Regardless of what the court decides, I think the way we were heard by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the two judges is very different from the way we would have been heard, say, 15 years ago. ""There's an interplay between public consciousness, and the law and due process. And that's exactly what I think is happening.""

"Several migrant deaths, coupled with reports of ""severely neglected"" children at a Texan border patrol station, have helped shape the debate. But the bill faces a tough path through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is considering a rival bill with fewer restrictions on how border agencies can spend the money. The Democrats' version, in contrast, contains several strict rules setting out that the funds can be used for humanitarian aid only, and ""not for immigration raids, not detention beds, not a border wall"", a statement from House appropriations committee chair Nita Lowey said. The bill was toughened up after some Democrats expressed concern over providing extra funds for agencies involved in the current situation, including those enforcing President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy which had last year led to migrant children being separated from their parents. With the extra safeguards, it passed 230 to 195, roughly along party lines - with a few Democrats still refusing to back it. The White House said President Trump would be advised to veto the House bill if it landed on his desk ""in its current form"". The administration accused the Democrats of seeking to ""take advantage of the current crisis"". Why is there a political crisis about the border? Mr Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy was announced in early 2018. By prosecuting adults who crossed the border illegally, it had the effect of separating children from their parents. Despite a court order requiring families to be reunited and an end to separations last year, hundreds remain in government shelters, to which the public - including journalists and rights activists - had little access. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again blamed his predecessor for separations and the facilities in which migrant children have been held. ""I'm going to put people together, but there's going to be more people coming up,"" the president told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. ""We've done a great job - a much better job than Obama - you know, Obama built all those cells."" While it is true that some of the centres were built under President Barack Obama's tenure, family separations became routine after Mr Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" policy was implemented. This was because previous administrations did not automatically refer families entering the US illegally for criminal proceedings, which then require separating children from detained parents to comply with existing US laws regarding child migrants. Lawyers were recently given access to one facility in Clint, Texas, by a judge. They reported appalling conditions inside, in which children under 10 were caring for infants, and massive overcrowding. Children were ""locked up in horrific cells where there's an open toilet in the middle of the room"" where they ate and slept, one of the lawyers told the BBC. Five questions about the border crisis Where do these people come from? Traditionally large numbers of Mexican economic migrants have declined, replaced in part by a surge in families with children from Central American countries - particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Why are they fleeing? Many of these families are fleeing extreme poverty or the risk of gang violence. The UN refugee agency calls the three countries ""some of the most dangerous places on Earth"" - but the US attorney general has decreed that gang violence does not usually qualify someone for asylum. Why are there still separated children? Although the separation of migrant families was officially halted in June 2018, the New York Times reported that 700 families had been separated in the year since via ""loopholes"" in the court order - when parents have a criminal conviction or a disease, or when it is an aunt, uncle, or sibling accompanying the child. Some parents may be children themselves. How many people cross the border? US Border Patrol says it has made 593,507 ""southwest border apprehensions"" since October 2018. Last month, 132,887 people were stopped - including 11,507 unaccompanied children and 84,542 travelling in families. How many people have died? Border Patrol recorded 283 deaths in the 2018 fiscal year. The United Nations Missing Migrants project reports that so far in 2019, 170 migrants have died or are missing on the US-Mexico border – including 13 children. Separately, a legal argument from the government that access to soap and a toothbrush were not necessarily ""required"" has drawn much criticism. The lawyer making those technical arguments later posted to Facebook privately distancing herself, NBC reports, saying she personally believed in ""doing our very best"" for children in care. But the public outcry was re-ignited on Tuesday following a report that many of the children had been returned to the Clint facility just days after being transferred out amid the public outcry. What has the reaction been? ""This situation is child abuse,"" Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. ""It is an atrocity that violates every value we have, not only as Americans, but as moral beings."" But her Republican counterpart in the House, Kevin McCarthy, responded that ""after weeks of doing nothing, and denying that a crisis exists, they are offering legislation that is misguided, and is purely political"". Several bodies, including those of babies and children, were discovered on the border in recent days, as some migrants opted to try and cross into the US illegally, avoiding the formal immigration system. A photograph of a father and his daughter lying face down in the water of the Rio Grande river has also shocked many. In the photograph, two-year-old Valeria has an arm wrapped around her father, Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez, as both lie dead close to shore. Published by the Associated Press on Tuesday, it has drawn comparisons to the photo of young Syrian boy Alan Kurdi, who became a symbol of the human cost of the war in Syria. Amid a major public outcry about the conditions facing migrant children, Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner John Sanders said he would be stepping down. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mark Morgan, is set to replace him.",Democrats in the US House of Representatives have approved $4.5bn (£3.5bn) in humanitarian aid for the southern border.
"The office, on the North's side of the militarised border, will be staffed by up to 20 people from each side. The Koreas will be able to ""directly discuss issues 24 hours, 365 days"", Seoul's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said. The opening comes ahead of a meeting between North and South leaders. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will meet in Pyongyang next week, in their third summit. Since US President Donald Trump and Mr Kim met at a historic meeting in June, little progress has been made on North Korean denuclearisation. But Mr Kim recently requested another meeting with Mr Trump, who hailed his ""very warm"" letter. The opening of the liaison office is a sign that even if talks between the North and the US are not moving forward, the two Koreas seem determined to develop closer ties, says BBC Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker. Mr Moon, who has positioned himself as a mediator between Mr Trump and Mr Kim, will seek to inject new energy into stalled US-North Korea nuclear talks when he meets Mr Kim on Tuesday in Pyongyang, analysts say. South Korea has said it hopes the liaison office will help in those efforts. The two sides in the past communicated by fax or special phone lines, which would often be cut when relations soured. The liaison office is in Kaesong, where South Korean firms once employed tens of thousands North Korean workers in a jointly run industrial park that symbolised peaceful engagement. South Korea suspended operations at the complex in 2016 after North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test. ""The two sides are now able to take a large step toward peace, prosperity and unification of the Korean peninsula by quickly and frankly discussing issues arising from inter-Korean relations,"" North Korean representative Ri Son-gwon said at a ceremony to mark the office's opening. The four-storey building will see the South Koreans placed on the second floor and the North Koreans on the fourth floor, Reuters reports. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and both sides remain technically at war.","The two Koreas have opened a ""liaison office"" that will allow them to communicate on a regular basis for the first time since the Korean War."
"By Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna The decision came after years of controversy. Austria had been on the verge of bringing in a total ban last year, but the plans were overturned because of pressure from the far-right Freedom Party, which was part of the last government. But after the fall of the coalition in May, the ban was reintroduced and came into force on 1 November. Some restaurants and cafes went non-smoking several years ago, but others allowed smoking until the last possible minute. How are they dealing with the change? Wratschko Wratschko is something of a Vienna institution. A pub with venerable wooden panelling and worn, ancient wallpaper, it serves deeply traditional Viennese food. And until a few weeks ago, it would have been full of cigarette smoke. Customers wishing to eat in the non-smoking area at the back had to walk through the smoky bar to get there. Its owner, Clemens Wratschko, says the atmosphere has improved and it is better for his staff as well. ""My employees are nearly all smokers and I told them you will be glad because you will have no more passive smoke; you'll smoke much less than before and the next day you will feel fresher than before."" Some bars and nightclubs have complained that fewer customers are coming since the ban and that they have lost between 15% and 25% of turnover. But Clemens Wratschko says he hasn't noticed any drop in numbers. He thinks people will come back to the night clubs, like they did in France, Italy and other countries which have introduced smoking bans. ""People want to go out and meet their friends, to enjoy a kind of atmosphere. People prefer to meet their friends in a pub or in a bar,"" he said. Café Rüdigerhof Down the road at Café Rüdigerhof, I met Ricci, who has been a waiter for 25 years. He says that after spending a few days away in protest, all his regular guests have now returned, despite the ban, and they are now smoking less. ""Before they smoked one pack of cigarettes at the cafe house, and now maybe they are happy because they smoke only two or three cigarettes because they have to go outside. I think it is not a problem."" Ricci says he is very pleased about the ban. ""Of course it is better for me and my work. We used to have to work in the smoking area. But it's much better. I can breathe much better."" However, Clemens Wratschko, himself a smoker, admits to a certain nostalgia for the smoky old days. ""Maybe I am a bit sentimental. In my pub, you had the very old rooms at the front, with the bar, with the taste of smoke and alcohol. And then you had the Speiseraum or eating room, with a little more of a distinguished atmosphere."" But he says the smoking ban brings in new qualities. ""We have better air. The clothes smell better the next day. And we feel a bit healthier, a bit less of a headache."" What public reaction has there been? In general the ban seems to be holding in Vienna. Figures from mid-November say that inspectors carried out more than 2,000 checks of restaurants and reported 27 breaches of the ban. Shisha bars are currently taking legal steps to try to get an exception for their businesses. A survey by an Austrian news magazine suggests that most Austrians are in favour of the ban. But last month, around 700 people protested against it in front of the Federal Chancellery. The demonstration was attended by the disgraced former head of the far-right Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache. How smoking bans have spread in Europe","Austria was once dubbed ""the ashtray of Europe"" but has finally banned smoking in restaurants, bars and cafes."
"The non-exclusive agreement will allow them to operate passenger, vehicle and freight services until 2024. Condor say the agreement means they can invest in a new, larger fast ferry to replace the existing two. Guernsey's government has also agreed to extend a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Condor until 2018. Jersey officials have negotiated a get-out clause that comes in after seven years if things are not running as expected. Senator Alan Maclean, the Economic Development Minister, made the announcement in the States of Jersey on Monday. Other operators He said other ferry operators were welcome too, but they had to provide the same level of service as Condor. He said: ""The new ramp permits, when issued, will be non-exclusive. A competitor that may wish to operate will have to provide a similar service to the incumbent provider. ""Any bona fide ship operator can apply, at any time, to run a similar service and the harbour master will be required to give them consideration."" Deputy Paul Luxon, chairman of Guernsey's external transport group said they had no mechanism in the island to provide a guaranteed licence like Jersey. He said: ""As an interim measure, Guernsey is proposing to extend the memorandum of understanding that it currently has in place with Condor to match the duration of the island's joint policy statement."" The chairman said they would take proposals to the States later in the year to create legislation that would ""more formally safeguard the Island's Roll On/Roll Off sea link connectivity"".",Condor Ferries has been given approval to apply for a 10-year licence to run ferry services between the UK and the Channel Islands.
"Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by a black officer on Tuesday. One protester remains in a critical condition after a ""civilian on civilian"" shooting, police said. Nine protesters were also injured while police arrested 44 people, according to the police chief. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said charges included looting, failure to disperse and assault. Five officers also required medical care, including two for minor eye injuries, he added. Mr Scott was the third black man killed by US police in a week. Such shootings have sparked nationwide protests. Riot police in Charlotte used tear gas as they faced hundreds of protesters. The local police department said four officers were injured. Earlier North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory said he had ""initiated efforts"" to deploy the national guard and highway patrol to help deal with the protests. ""Any violence directed toward our citizens or police officers or destruction of property should not be tolerated,"" he said. The demonstrators are angry that Mr Scott, 43, was killed by police on Tuesday afternoon at a block of flats in disputed circumstances. Police were serving an arrest warrant on another person when they say they saw Mr Scott get out of a car with a handgun. Officers say he was repeatedly told to drop his handgun before he was shot but his family say he was reading a book, as he waited for his son to be dropped off by the school bus. Police video of the incident will be viewed by Charlotte's mayor but will not be released to the public ""at that time"", the city said. City leader Jennifer Roberts said Mr Scott's family will also be allowed to watch the footage, local television station WBTV reported. It is legal to openly carry a handgun in North Carolina, but a special permit is required to carry a concealed weapon. Bottles and fireworks Governor McCrory declared the state of emergency as rioters clashed with police, breaking windows and setting small fires. The second night of protests had begun peacefully but the demonstration was interrupted by gunfire and a man in the crowd was injured. The city initially said he had been killed but then issued a clarification. Protesters then threw bottles and fireworks at the officers, who were lined up in riot gear. Police fired flash grenades and tear gas to repel the crowds. Several journalists were also reportedly attacked. A reporter and cameraman for Charlotte's WCNC-TV were taken to hospital and a CNN journalist was tackled on live TV, local media report. Three fatal police shootings in last week Ohio police kill boy 'who drew BB gun' Tulsa shooting: The unanswered questions Trump 'troubled' by Tulsa police shooting Police in Charlotte defended their actions in the death of Mr Scott by insisting he had been repeatedly warned to drop his gun. Chief Putney told a news conference Mr Scott first got out of the car with a gun, then got back into his vehicle when officers told him to drop his weapon. He was shot when he emerged from his car holding his weapon. The police chief was unable to say if Mr Scott had been pointing his weapon at officers. After her father's death, Mr Scott's daughter posted a video on Facebook in which she said her father had been unarmed and reading a book. Mr Putney said no book was found. Charlotte: Facts Mayor Roberts voiced her shock at the violent protests, which saw 16 police officers injured on Tuesday night. ""Charlotte is a city that has worked very hard to build good community police relations,"" she told the BBC. ""We have been a model of community policing. We have actually trained other police forces. This is not who we are as Charlotteans and I'm hoping we can move past these protests very quickly, move into more peaceful protests and back into dialogue."" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's North Carolina state chapter has called for the ""full release of all facts available"", including video. ""In these days of ready video and audio recordings, we believe that reviewing these recordings can and will help both sides get to the truth,"" it said in a statement. The group said it supported peaceful protests but was against ""unjust, random or purposeless acts of violence"".","North Carolina's governor has declared a state of emergency in the city of Charlotte, after violence erupted during a second night of protests over the police killing of a black man."
"By Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Perhaps the most noticeable thing about the presidential love scoop is the near absence of a reaction. The main French television stations are treating the story with coy disinterest. For most of them it is way down the running order: a bit of muck dug up by their (distant) cousins in the ""people"" press. Mid-morning, no-one had even sent a crew to film the alleged trysting-place. When I arrived, I was expecting hordes. But only I and a Belgian snapper were present. Even on the French version of Google News, you have to look hard to find the latest on the Hollande-Gayet match. Either there is genuinely no interest in the story; or there is a vast conspiracy to pretend no-one's interested. From an Anglo-Saxon perspective, of course it looks faintly ludicrous - as if the French can't spot a good tale when it's staring them in the face; or else are too scared to tell it. But from a French point of view it is different. So much of the French way of doing things is conditioned by their horror at what they see when they look across the Channel. This nostrum certainly applies in the world of the press. 'People' watching The French are brought up to believe in the appalling intrusiveness of the British and American tabloids. They also like to nurse the notion that - being open-minded types - they don't give a hoot about politicians' private lives. All of which explains why - if you ask them - most French people will agree that the Hollande love match is a non-story which their newspapers are quite right to treat with disdain. And yet. The very fact that Closer magazine has dared to go public with the story shows how things are moving. Such a report would have been unthinkable in the press a few years ago. True, the story of Francois Mitterrand's love-child with Anne Pingeot was first reported in Paris-Match. But that was almost certainly by prior arrangement with the people concerned. The fact is that the limits of what constitutes privacy in France are being tested as never before. Technology is changing, the press is changing, and people's expectations are changing too. Certainly French courts continue routinely to hand out damages to aggrieved celebrities. But now judges are beginning to ask difficult questions about how far the celebrities have gone to entice media interest. By posing for money in the glossies, for example. And they adjust the damages accordingly. And on the whole issue of public interest, a broader, more ""Anglo-Saxon"" reading is starting to make headway. Only a few weeks ago, for example, publishers were given the go-ahead for a book disclosing the homosexuality of a leading member of the National Front. The judges said this was acceptable because it had a bearing in the debate on gay marriage. Those in the know In the Hollande-Gayet affair, there is at the very least a case to be made that disclosure is in the public interest. Closer made a half-hearted nod in this direction by claiming there were security issues at stake. However given that the alleged love-apartment is in a guarded street next to the Elysee, that seems a little far-fetched. A more convincing case might be that Francois Hollande is the president of the French, and as such represents the French. So they have a right to know it, if he's planning to ditch his current ""First Mistress"" (Valerie Trierweiler) for another. Or the French might like to know what lies behind the president's widely reported unhappiness at the moment. Is his unpopularity due to the dire state of the economy? Or is it his domestic situation? But surely one of the strongest arguments in favour of disclosure is that, in fact, a lot of people had already heard rumours of the presidential affair. It was just that, as usual, these people were the Paris ""in-crowd"" - the sort of people who gravitate around the same politico-journo-thespian circles that Hollande and Gayet both frequent. Events of recent weeks - the rise of the new populism as represented by the comic Dieudonne - should have convinced anyone that one of the biggest problems in France is the growing divide between those inside the ""system"" and those out of it. The long-standing complicity of insiders in keeping certain facts to themselves has certainly not helped.","After the bombshell, the silence."
"Oakland leader Libby Schaaf has defended her warning to the public about the immigration agents' swoop. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents said they were nevertheless able to detain 150 people. Half of those detained in Tuesday's raid had criminal convictions, according to Ice. ""I do not regret sharing this,"" said Mayor Schaaf, a Democrat, who issued her warning on Saturday. ""It is Oakland's legal right to be a sanctuary city and we have not broken any laws,"" she added. ""We believe our community is safer when families stay together."" In a statement announcing the arrests, Ice deputy director Thomas Homan singled out Mayor Schaaf for criticism. He also deplored so-called US sanctuary cities, which limit the assistance they offer to federal immigration officials. ""The Oakland mayor's decision to publicise her suspicions about Ice operations further increased that risk for my officers and alerted criminal aliens - making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda with the very federal laws that Ice is sworn to uphold,"" he said. He said 864 immigrants with criminal records ""remain at large in the community and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor's irresponsible decision"". On Saturday, Mayor Schaaf warned of imminent Ice raids in the San Francisco Bay area, though she said she was unaware of ""precise locations"" to be targeted. ""I am sharing this information publicly not to panic our residents but to protect them,"" said her news release. ""My priority is for the well-being and safety of all residents, particularly our most vulnerable."" This isn't her first row with Mr Homan. Last month she told reporters she would be willing to go to jail to defend her city's policy. Her defiance followed a suggestion by Mr Homan that the Justice Department should criminally charge politicians who support sanctuary jurisdictions. Mayor Schaaf said she had consulted with her legal team before issuing the weekend's warning. They had determined she did not violate any laws because she had obtained the information from unofficial sources rather than through formal government channels, she said. But former federal prosecutor Tony Brass told CBS in San Francisco that ""she's on the threshold of obstruction of justice for doing what she did"". Last week President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw immigration enforcement agencies from California, accusing the state of shielding ""horrible criminals"". Mr Trump predicted state officials would be ""begging"" for federal immigration authorities to come back within two months because crime rates would skyrocket.","Federal officials say a California mayor's ""irresponsible"" tip-off about an immigration raid allowed more than 800 ""criminal aliens"" to evade capture."
"The investors are demanding payments worth more than $1.3bn (£766m) dollars on government bonds they hold. Argentina defaulted on its debts in July after refusing to comply with a US court ruling in favour of the funds. It is searching for ways of meeting its obligations to its other creditors without paying the hedge funds in full. The Argentine government has accused the hedge funds, which it refers to as vulture funds, of being greedy and damaging its economy. ""The vulture funds will not stop unless we stop them ourselves,"" Foreign Minister Hector Timerman told the council before the vote. ""The billions that these vulture funds grab in countries in the south lead to school closures, hospitals without medicines, political instability, insecurity and violence,"" he said. The resolution was tabled by Argentina along with Russia, Brazil, Venezuela and Algeria. It was approved by 33 votes to five, with nine countries abstaining. The United States, Britain, Germany, Japan and the Czech Republic voted against. 'Higher borrowing costs' The resolution ""condemns the activities of vulture funds"" and says it regrets the effect the debt payment to such funds could have ""on the capacity of governments to fulfil their human rights obligations"". The American representative at the council, Keith Harper, said the text was unacceptable. ""The state's responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms is not contingent on its sovereign debt situation,"" he said. The uncertainty could ""drive up borrowing costs or even choke off financing for developing countries,"" added Mr Harper. The investors - led by hedge funds NML and Aurelius Capital Management - bought Argentine government bonds at a big discount after Argentina's 2001 default. They rejected the terms of a restructuring agreed by most bondholders in 2005 and 2010 which saw two-thirds of the bonds' pre-crisis value written off. The hedge funds are instead demanding a full 100% repayment of the debt. Argentina fell into default again in July after US District Judge Thomas Griesa barred the Bank of New York Mellon from transferring an interest payment to bondholders unless Argentina settled with the hedge funds.",The United Nations Human Rights Council has passed a resolution in Geneva condemning a group of American hedge funds that took Argentina to court.
"Mr Trump said the Federal Reserve was ""the only problem"" of the US economy. Mr Trump's treasury secretary meanwhile scrambled to calm investors. The Dow Jones fell more than 650 points on Monday, and is on track for its worst December since 1931 during the Great Depression. On Tuesday morning, Japan's Nikkei was down about 5%. The turmoil comes amid a partial government shutdown, US-China trade tensions and reports the president has discussed firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. Mr Trump continually boasted about Wall Street's steep climb during the first year of his presidency, but has sought to deflect blame since markets hit a rough patch in 2018. On Sunday US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took the unusual step of calling the chief executives of America's six largest banks in a bid to soothe market jitters. On Monday, he called top market regulators and officials from the US central bank to allay fears about the economy. Mr Mnuchin hosted the call with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to ""discuss co-ordination efforts to assure normal market operations"", according a treasury statement. The board of governors of the US Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission are on the working group. Not a very merry Christmas Analysis by Samira Hussain, business reporter, BBC News, New York It is rare for a US treasury secretary to make public his discussions with American financial institutions. But that is exactly what Mr Mnuchin did. He was attempting to ease financial markets but Monday's swoon showed he did the opposite. So then President Trump weighed in by tweet and renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve. That also did not have the desired effect. Instead of the typical Santa Rally, we saw US investors flee stocks for safety. Not exactly the Christmas cheer the White House was hoping for. What does this mean for 2019? A lot will depend on what happens in Washington: government shutdown, simmering trade tensions and the president's tweets. One thing has been made very clear: if the White House wants to calm nervous investors, it's going to need to get much better at its messaging. Why are investors worried? Monday saw the worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever for US stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 653 points, falling below 22,000. The S&P 500 entered so-called ""bear market"" territory. US investors are fretful about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally, though US economic data is still strong. Mr Trump's ongoing trade war with China as well as Defence Secretary Jim Mattis's surprise resignation have also unsettled investors. In addition, a partial US government shutdown began at midnight on Friday after Congress refused to fund President Trump's planned US-Mexico border wall. The shutdown could continue until the opening of the next Congress on 3 January. What did US Treasury say? A Sunday statement from the treasury took the rare step of divulging details about Mr Mnuchin's discussions with the top US banks. ""The [bank's chief executives] confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations,"" the statement said. ""We continue to see strong economic growth in the US,"" Mr Mnuchin added. Earlier, he dismissed reports that President Trump had discussed the possibility of firing the Federal Reserve chairman after the bank raised interest rates last week. The US treasury secretary tweeted that he had spoken to the president, who insisted he ""never suggested firing"" Jerome Powell and did not believe he had the right to do so. Did Mnuchin spook markets? Some financial pundits warned Mr Mnuchin's intervention could backfire. Jared Bernstein, who was economic adviser to former US Vice-President Joe Biden, told the Washington Post: ""The markets are already nervous enough. ""It's like sending out a message saying our space shields can intercept incoming asteroids. Uh, I didn't know there were any coming our way."" Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management, said: ""More than anything else right now, Washington and politics are absolutely driving investor sentiment and market direction and that can turn on a dime."" Win Thin, head of global currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, told the Financial Times: ""At best, Mnuchin made a rookie policy mistake in trying to reassure markets; at worst, Mnuchin knows something that the markets don't.""",President Donald Trump has lashed out at America's central bank as a stock market whose gains he once took credit for continued a historic plunge.
"By Georgina SmithJournalist Tracking the insects is an art in itself, with daily surveillance operations across the country scrambling to confirm the latest coordinates of swarms before deploying spray planes to destroy them with pesticide. Every morning, Ambrose Ng'etich (left) from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) boards a helicopter with Captain Iltasayon Neepe to locate the locust swarms in northern-central Kenya. The migratory pests, which carried on the wind can cover 150km (95 miles) a day, have devastated crops, pasture for livestock and livelihoods in recent months. Mr Ng'etich's job is to manage desert locust control efforts over the vast plains of Samburu, Isiolo, Laikipia and Meru. The sandy soils in this area are ideal for desert locusts to lay their eggs. ""When the sun is warm enough, then you will know the quantity you are dealing with, they are spread all over. You can even have swarms covering up to 100km,"" says the FAO official. Before the coronavirus pandemic struck, it estimated that locust invasions would push more than 25 million people across East Africa into food insecurity. Last month, emergency financing to the tune of $43m (£34m) was approved by the World Bank for Kenya's desert locust response. On their daily rounds, Captain Neepe and Mr Ng'etich land the helicopter and talk to community members, gathering information about the locusts' possible whereabouts. ""We have already trained a number of scouts that are going to help the community understand,"" says Mr Ng'etich. Residents are to identify the size of swarms and relay this information back to FAO surveillance teams. The next step in ""recovery efforts and building resilience"" will include cash transfer schemes when families are expected to be worst hit by food shortages. Pastoralists are being worst affected. Standing outside his empty goat pen in Samburu County, a three-hour drive north-east of Isiolo town, 32-year-old Tiampati Leletit explains that he lost 80 of his goats after the locusts came. He gave his four remaining goats to a neighbour, so they could be part of a herd. Mr Leletit had planted some maize, beans and other crops to feed his family in the meantime, but the locusts ate them too. ""They cleared everything,"" he says. He has planted yet more crops, and hopes the locusts will not come back. But now the fear is that a new wave could hit this month, when crops are ready for harvest. ""With the desert locust situation developing as it is, we are anticipating higher levels of food insecurity in the coming months,"" says Lane Bunkers, of Catholic Relief Services, working on acute malnutrition with mostly pastoralist communities in northern Kenya. Erupe Lobun, a 40-year-old Turkana herder and father of 13, says the recent wave of desert locusts has decimated the amount of food available for his herd of 60 goats. He believes pesticides have also affected his animals, but with Covid-19 restricting people's movements, he cannot summon the vet. Underfed mother goats are being kept apart from their young because they don't have enough milk to suckle them. ""It means we have nothing to eat,"" Mr Lobun says. ""Livestock are our strength."" Grazing land is also under strain. ""This is my first time to see the locusts. My father used to tell me stories about the locusts a long time ago,"" says Moses Lomooria, 34. ""What we are used to is drought,"" he says, which has reduced his herd of cattle from 60 to 24. ""We are worried,"" he says, adding that if herders on the other side of the mountain also run out of food, they will start coming for their pasture.

"Edi Rama's historic trip to Belgrade was seen as an attempt to put differences aside after a football international was abandoned last month. But tempers flared when Mr Rama said Kosovo's independence was ""undeniable"" and ""must be respected"". Serbian PM Aleksandar Vucic hit back accusing him of a ""provocation"". Kosovo, a former Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority, unilaterally declared independence in 2008. Although many European nations and the US have recognised its independence, dozens of other countries do not, along with Serbia and the thousands of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo itself. Simmering resentment between Albania and Serbia spilled over at last month's Euro 2016 qualifier in Belgrade. Play was halted before half time when a drone appeared above the pitch, carrying an Albanian flag and a map of ""greater Albania"" showing nationalist claims on neighbouring states, including Serbia. A Serbia player pulled down the flag and a brawl ensued during which several Albanian players were attacked by fans. The Albanian prime minister was caught up in last month's row when Serbian media accused his brother of controlling the drone from the stadium's stands. Mr Rama's visit had already been postponed because of the anger surrounding the match on both sides. Then a news conference on Monday with his Serbian counterpart descended into both leaders trading barbs. While both countries had completely different positions, Mr Rama said, the reality was ""one and unchangeable"". ""Independent Kosovo is an undeniable regional and European reality, and it must be respected,"" he insisted, provoking an angry response from Mr Vucic. ""I did not expect this provocation,'' the Serbian PM said. ""What does Albania have to do with Kosovo? Kosovo is not part of Albania and it will never be.'' The exchange continued with Mr Vucic saying that nobody would humiliate Serbia and Mr Rama denying that his remarks were provocative. The sooner Kosovo was recognised ""the faster we can move on,"" the Albanian leader said. Diplomats had tried to patch up relations after last month's brawl and Serbian radio station B92 reported that Mr Rama had spoken ahead of his trip of a new beginning for the Balkans. The last such visit to Belgrade was when Albania's communist leader Enver Hoxha met Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito in 1946.","The first visit to Serbia for 68 years by an Albanian prime minister has turned into a diplomatic spat about the status of Kosovo, broadcast live on TV."
"Russia is Turkey's second most important foreign trading partner after Germany. As a result, experts say economic retaliation would be keenly felt by Ankara - but the Kremlin would not be unharmed either. Here the BBC's Russian Service looks at the main trade links between Russia and Turkey that risk being hit hardest by the downturn in relations. Tourism Turkey is the top foreign holiday destination for Russian tourists. Some 3.2 million Russian holidaymakers travelled to Turkey last year, according to Russia's Federal Tourism Agency. In comparison, 2.5 million went on holiday to Egypt. Until the past year, Russians made up the largest group of tourists in Turkey. But they lost the top spot to Germans because of the fall of the rouble. Bookings to Turkey went back up after Russia banned flights to Egypt following the Sinai plane crash on 31 October. However, the downing of the Russian SU-24 warplane by Turkey means it is unlikely this trend will continue. Natural gas Turkey bought 57% of its gas from Russia in 2013. Last year it became the second largest consumer of Russian gas after Germany: Germany imported 36bn cubic metres (bcm) and Turkey imported 27.3bcm. Turkey gets its Russian gas via two routes - the Blue Stream pipeline across the Black Sea, and the gas transportation corridor through Romania, Ukraine and Moldova. Plans for a ""Turkish Stream"" to transport 63bcm of Russian gas through Turkey and on to Europe - bypassing Ukraine - have stalled since they were announced by the Russian and Turkish presidents in December 2014. Atomic Energy Turkey has to import nearly all the energy it consumes. In 2012, Moscow and Ankara agreed to build Turkey's first nuclear power plant, the Akkuyu plant. It was designed to save Turkey about $14bn (£9bn) annually on energy imports. The nuclear power plant is now under construction in the province of Mersin on the Mediterranean coast. Russia has already invested $3bn in it. In October, the Turkish authorities said Russia's military activity in Syria could threaten its future involvement in the project. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in October: ""If the Russians don't build Akkuyu, someone else will come along and build it."" Construction and clothes There are about 100 Turkish construction companies working in Russia. Turkish firms have built more than 800 projects in Russia since the end of the 1980s, according to official Russian data. Turkish investors also have stakes in a number of brands sold in the Russian market, such as Tevolina shoes and the Gloria Jeans clothes brand, as well as the food and chemical industries. On Wednesday the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti quoted Gennadiy Onishchenko, an aide to the Russian prime minister, as saying that people who bought Turkish goods financially supported Turkish servicemen. ""Everyone understands that each Turkish tomato bought... is a contribution to yet another missile which will be shooting at our guys,"" he was quoted as saying. Compiled by Dmitry Bulin",Russia has warned of heavy economic sanctions after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on its border with Syria.
"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter Small numbers of foreign nationals are already ill. Governments whose citizens abroad have been unlucky to be caught up are weighing up the dilemmas of repatriation and isolating those who may be carriers of the virus once home. Some countries have closed their borders to Chinese nationals altogether. And, in some quarters, there has - perhaps inevitably - been an unpleasant and quite unfair stigmatisation of China and the Chinese. The immediate economic impact of the crisis is also apparent. In the first place those industries that depend upon the movement of goods and people - tourism, airlines, the operators of cruise ships and commercial shipping lines - are already suffering. The crisis has thrown into stark relief the global supply chain behind many of the products we take for granted. The supply of mobile phones, microprocessors, spare parts for the motor industry may all be interrupted. Even the service sector, for example foreign universities who have set up off-shoots in China, will find its income threatened. How long this will all last is impossible to say. So too its ramifications for Beijing. It depends upon how the epidemic plays out. As Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Washington think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes: ""The impact on perception of Xi Jinping at home and abroad will depend on the duration of the virus and its impact on the Chinese economy."" ""If the Chinese Communist Party can control the spread of the epidemic and end the crisis,"" she argues, ""few people inside China will continue to criticise the party for its initial slow response and efforts to cover up the outbreak."" Many countries who have sought investment from China as part of its Belt and Road initiative will continue to do so, she told me. ""They'll continue to want Chinese loans for infrastructure projects since there aren't other sources of financing."" But what may be the lasting impact of the crisis? To what extent could it change perceptions of China and especially of President Xi Jinping himself and indeed the whole direction in which he is taking his country? How could the fallout from the coronavirus impact the key relationship between Beijing and Washington? And with clear signs of a technological ""cold war"" already developing between the US and China - the battle over 5G and artificial intelligence - could the tensions surrounding the virus outbreak make things worse? So first of all what does the crisis tell us about China itself? Elizabeth Economy, director for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, says that inside China there are essentially two distinct narratives. ""The first, which is already being advanced by China's diplomatic corps, is that China has taken extraordinary measures to contain the virus - both for the sake of its own people and as a gift to the rest of the world,"" she says. These actions, they say, ""are enabled by China's particular top-down authoritarian model"". But then there is a second narrative, Economy argues, that says, ""China lost precious time in addressing the crisis because of its political system and its determination to silence independent voices."" ""Also under Xi Jinping, local officials have become more afraid to acknowledge that things are not going well. This too has hampered an effective response."" As a long-time China-watcher, Elizabeth Economy told me that what she found especially concerning was ""that even in the wake of Dr Li Wenliang's death, the Communist Party continues to hunt down independent voices"". Dr Li was seen by many in China as a whistleblower and hero; the man who first highlighted the threat posed by the Wuhan virus outbreak. He himself succumbed to the disease. ""One might have hoped,"" says Economy, ""that his death - and the popular response to it - would have signalled to the Chinese leadership the value of transparency and a more open civil society in mounting an effective response to a nationwide crisis."" So much for perceptions inside China itself, but what about the rest of the world? Elizabeth Economy says that she does not think that the coronavirus will change perceptions of the Chinese government, rather she argues, ""it will simply feed into pre-existing beliefs. Supporters will stress the impressive mobilisation of resources, while detractors will focus on the lack of transparency and concern over the accuracy of Chinese information."" On the economic front though it could be significant, even just by throwing into stark relief things that we already know. The disease outbreak has underscored the significance of China to the global economy and the importance of diversified supply chains. And this, according to Elizabeth Economy, ""will perhaps encourage more companies not to place too much of their manufacturing in China or rely too heavily on the Chinese consumer market."" At the recent annual security conference that I attended in Munich, the shadow of the coronavirus and its likely impact upon the medium- and long-term relationship between Washington and Beijing overshadowed much of the debate. Ian Bremmer, founder and chief strategist of Eurasia Group, the leading political risk and consulting firm, told me that the crisis had the potential to significantly re-shape the US-China business relationship, though not exactly for the reasons that many people might think. ""US companies,"" he told me, ""have long been thinking about reducing supply chain exposure to China given increasing trade hostilities, in addition to a Chinese labour force that is increasingly expensive and inefficient."" With coronavirus, he explains ""US companies may now have the excuse they need to actually make that move. That's obviously an extreme example, but it's a very real prospect down the line, the longer coronavirus continues to cause mayhem."" At the very least, he argues, ""the coronavirus makes it highly unlikely that China will be able to fully implement the 'Phase One' trade deal it just signed with the US, further intensifying the trend of decoupling between the US and China."" Bonnie Glaser agrees that China will have difficulty meeting the commitments it made in the ""Phase One"" deal. But, she argues, ""the US will likely cut Beijing some slack"". ""With his eye on re-election,"" she notes, ""President Trump will celebrate his achievement and seek to preserve good relations with Xi, while pledging to make more progress in 'Phase Two'. 2020,"" she says, ""is going to be a year of treading water."" Here we see the crucial inter-section of economics, diplomacy and domestic politics. Each has a part to play in the relationship between Washington and Beijing, but the salience or relative weight of each factor varies depending upon the circumstances. As Ian Bremmer notes, ""for the time being, Trump has been quite positive about President Xi's handling of the situation"". But, he argues, ""that's largely been the result of Trump being relatively shielded from the fallout of the coronavirus crisis himself"". All this could quite easily change, Bremmer asserts. ""Should the coronavirus start having real economic impact in the US - and in an election year no less - we're more likely to see President Trump go after Xi much more aggressively. ""And this won't just be empty rhetoric. Given the bipartisan hawkishness on China that already exists more broadly in the US these days"", he concludes, ""a Trump decision to turn on Xi would have real impact on the relationship between the world's only two economic superpowers."" This bipartisan hostility to China was clearly in evidence at the Munich conference. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, headed a large congressional delegation and she was outspoken against the Chinese, especially concerning technological rivalry. But to my ear this wasn't just about business or technology. There was a clear ideological element to the debate. Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, preferred to refer to the actions of the ""Chinese Communist Party"" rather than ""China"". Thus the coronavirus crisis has the potential to dramatically worsen the already deteriorating climate between Washington and Beijing. And this could have much broader consequences, not least for the Europeans (or indeed for Washington's Asian allies), who will be caught in the middle. I asked Ian Bremmer if what we saw in Munich - bullish interventions on China from Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Esper - amounted to the declaration of a new global ""high-technology cold war"" between the US and China. ""Close to it,"" was his answer. But he stressed that the Europeans had no interest in getting caught in the middle of this brewing high-tech cold war. ""Indeed,"" he noted, ""it's the first time in the transatlantic relationship you've ever seen the Americans and the Europeans in such disagreement over what their respective top national security concerns should be."" This in turn could have a profound impact on the already somewhat strained relationship between the US and some of its Nato partners. ""As much as the Americans may be gearing up for a 'cold war' vis-à-vis China on tech,"" Bremmer told me, ""at the moment it's looking increasingly like a bilateral 'cold war' rather than a global one. And as the Americans begin to actually pivot to Asia on security matters and the Europeans don't, it's also looking likely that there are even rougher waters ahead for the transatlantic relationship."" Correction 4 March 2020: An earlier version of this article referred to the Coronavirus as a pandemic. However the World Health Organization is not using this description and so this sentence has been amended.","As China struggles to contain the spread of the epidemic, the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis is already upon us."
"Corbiere won the Grand National in 1983 by three-quarters of a length. The horse, named after the Jersey lighthouse, was jockeyed by Ben de Haan and was the first Grand National winner to be trained by a woman, Jenny Pitman. Melanie Gouzinis from Jersey Post said Corbiere was remembered with so fondly that his death in 1988 was reported on BBC news. She said: ""Corbiere was owned by Bryan Burrough, the great grandson of the First Lord Trent, Jesse Boot, founder of Boots the chemist. ""Jesse Boot had married a local girl, Florence Booth and together, they gifted significant park and recreational land to the people of Jersey."" She said Jenny Pitman, Bryan Burrough and Ben de Haan were all delighted to help with the research for the stamps. 'Big white blaze' Mr Burrough provided photographs which were used for artistic reference and Ms Pitman wrote the text for the envelopes and presentation packs. Mr Burrough said: ""The horse had a big white blaze so it also seemed appropriate to name it after a lighthouse. ""We took Corbiere over to Jersey to see the lighthouse and parade at the racecourse, however as you can imagine on a windy day with a restless horse the photo is not perfect."" The stamps have been painted by artist Nick Watton. Ms Pitman said Corbiere was ""not the fastest by any means but with an undeniable strength of character, he was as brave as a lion and his enthusiasm for life warmed your heart on the bleakest winter day."" ""His exuberance out at exercise, bucking and kicking at the end of a morning's work as he made his way back home from the gallops, required the patience of a saint and his devoted rider, Gary Curran, pandered to his every whim. ""No horse I've trained loved life more than Corky,"" he said.",A Grand National winning horse named after a famous Jersey landmark has appeared on a new set of stamps.
"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter Russia's President Vladimir Putin seized upon US President Donald Trump's election victory as offering the potential for a very different relationship. Mr Putin appears to have misjudged what was on offer. Relying upon clear signals from the Trump campaign that a reset in the US relationship was both possible and desirable, Moscow intruded into the US campaign to an extent which US intelligence agencies believe was unprecedented. (Quite how far Russia intruded into the US campaign in actually backing candidate Trump is currently under investigation and this, of course, provides an important element of the backdrop to the worsening diplomatic relationship.) Russia, of course, denies this but it is clear that they had high hopes of the new political maverick in Washington. Russia hoped for a change in the climate; one where the lifting of many of the western sanctions imposed after its annexation of Crimea might become possible. But more than this, it wanted a new deal between the US and Russia that would acknowledge Moscow as an equal diplomatic player and indeed as a partner in trouble spots, such as Syria, and in the wider struggle against Islamist terror. These hopes have now come to nothing. Russia seems to have placed unrealistic hopes in what President Trump might achieve. Did Mr Putin see him as a forceful like-minded character, or as a political and diplomatic lightweight that might be manipulated and dominated? Either way, Russia's own actions in intruding into the US political space and the subsequent investigations have precluded any fresh start. Russia perhaps failed to understand the Congressional hostility to its activities, mistaking the Trump insiders' lack of concern for the predominant view of the president's supporters on Capitol Hill. So where does this leave things now? Well, relations between Washington and Moscow were already not good and all these expulsions do is to confirm that they are not going to get better any time soon. This clearly has implications for the Ukraine crisis; for the conflict in Syria and so on. It means that Moscow is likely to step up its information campaigns and cyber activity against the West and especially against smaller countries whose infrastructure and political systems are seen as more vulnerable. Russia will continue the modernisation of its strategic nuclear arms - but then the US has ambitious plans here too. But this is no simple reprise of the original Cold War. Russia is simply not the global power that the Soviet Union was. However, there are grounds for concern. Its ideology - a kind of authoritarian state capitalism - is seen as attractive, even by politicians in some Nato countries. But there are limitations on Russia's behaviour too. One is the fact that there is only so much mileage in being a spoiler. Diplomatic influence requires engagement too - that's why, for example, Russia remained a key player in efforts to agree an Iranian nuclear deal even when its relations with the Obama administration were souring. Indeed, Russia's decision to reduce US diplomatic representation is a relatively mild response, suggesting that Moscow is perhaps hoping to keep doors open to the Trump administration. Secondly, Russia's misjudgement of the Trump administration's ability to deliver a reset is a salutary lesson for Moscow. With a weakened State Department and a White House increasingly dominated by Trump loyalists with little wider diplomatic experience, the US - as seen from Moscow - looks increasingly unpredictable. And that - as the first Cold War showed - is not a good thing for anyone.","Russia's decision to significantly reduce the number of US diplomatic staff marks the end of any immediate hope for a fresh start between Moscow and Washington. Indeed, it could usher in a new and uncertain period of competition between the two capitals."
"John Berry told the Australian the US was ""surprised"" by the extent of China's involvement in politics. He urged greater transparency around political donations. Last week, Labor Senator Sam Dastyari resigned from the opposition frontbench after admitting taking money from companies linked to China. The scandal has led to debate about reforming rules on foreign donations, with Labour calling for a ban. Mr Dastyari did not break the law by accepting money from the Top Education company, but said he was wrong to have accepted the money to cover personal costs. Top Education, which has links to the Chinese government, has also donated money to both the Labor party and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal party. 'There is concern' In an unprecedented critique, the outgoing ambassador said China was an undemocratic country exploiting Australia's democratic system. ""I can see no argument of how a foreign government's involvement through political contributions advances Australia's interests,"" Mr Berry said. ""In our country it's illegal. It would be against the law for any foreign donation to be accepted by any level of government or member of government."" He said the US had been ""surprised, quite frankly, at the extent of the ­involvement of the Chinese government in Australian politics"". ""There is concern. Our hope is that, in resolving this, Australia will consider doing what many other democracies have done: that is to protect their core responsibility against undue influence from governments that don't share our values.""",The outgoing US ambassador to Australia has expressed concern about the influence of Chinese money on Australian politics.
"There were highs, as when he, as a teenager in Houston, played American football for the 1992 Texas state champion runners-up Yates High School Lions. There were lows, as when he was arrested for robbery in 2007 and served five years in prison. But mostly, it would seem that Floyd, who was 46 when he died in Minneapolis on 25 May, 2020, was simply trying to live life as any other American, in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges. His death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than 100,000 Americans and left over 40 million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in 2020. A native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre. Beyoncé grew up there, as did Bayou City's blues music scene. Drake, a Canadian rapper, paid homage to its musical vibrancy, and Floyd himself is thought to have 'spit bars' as part of the hip-hop group in the 1990s in Houston. But poverty, racial division and economic inequalities mark its history, too, as with any American city. Marred by segregation in the 20th Century, the Third Ward Floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing. ""Anytime I take somebody who's not from there, people actually are like 'man, oh my God, I've never seen poverty like this. ""It looks like a bomb went off, what happened?'"" Ronnie Lillard, a friend from the neighbourhood tells the BBC. ""People are still living in shot-gun shacks that were erected in the 1920s. The poverty is thorough... and being from that area, it's hard to escape,"" says Mr Lillard, a rapper who performs under the name Reconcile. Floyd was well known in the council estate housing project, Cuney Homes, he adds. ""Cuney Homes is known as 'The Bricks' and if you're from there they call you 'a brickboy'. He was a brickboy."" Growing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches, friends who knew Floyd as a teenager described him as a ""gentle giant"" who shone on the field in two sports, basketball as well as American football. ""I was blown away, cause at 12 years old he was six-foot-two,"" Jonathan Veal, a childhood friend and former teammate, told local media. ""I had never seen anyone that tall before"". At John Yates High School, he wore number 88 in the tight end position for the football team, and was later recruited to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, where he was a student from 1993 to 1995, according to CNN. He returned to Texas for a school year at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, but did not complete his degree. His life then took a different turn, with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in 2007, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison. He became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood, says Mr Lillard. ""While he was embracing his own life change, he was looking around at his community."" A video of Floyd decrying gun violence, believed to be filmed in 2017, has circulated on social media, in which he implored young people to ""come home"". His family told the Houston Chronicle he moved to Minnesota in 2018 after being encouraged by friends through a Christian work programme. Christopher Harris, a friend and former classmate, told US media Mr Floyd ""was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning"". ""He was happy with the change he was making,"" he added. The former athlete found work as a security guard at a local Salvation Army charity, and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as ""Big Floyd."" Like many Americans, however, he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the Covid-19 crisis. On the day of his arrest, he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Anger over Mr Floyd's death has spurred protests across the US, with some descending into chaos and violence. Over 1,600 people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities, and the National Guard deployed in 15 states. Mr Lillard, who described his friend as a ""person of peace"", would have supported people's rights to be heard and for change, but would not have condoned the looting or the violence. ""He had a heart bent towards forgiveness, but he also was a man of the people, too,"" he said. ""Even before his death, he was aware that people were hurting."" ""I think this thing has grown into something more than George Floyd,"" he added, speaking of the protests. ""I think you're watching frustration that America has with America [itself].""","Before the image of George Floyd lying under the knee of a policeman set off shock, anger and protests across the US, the arch of his life crossed crests and troughs."
"It came after the UAE issued a visa ban on Kenyans, allegedly after visitors were found using forged certificates. The suspects are due to appear in court later on Friday, according to local media. Coronavirus cases are rising in Kenya and on Thursday it tightened restrictions on public gatherings. Earlier this week, the UAE decided to stop giving visas to citizens of 13 countries, including Kenya, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. The 21 travellers were attempting to fly to Dubai when they were apprehended at the main airport in Kenyan capital Nairobi on Thursday. They are accused of using forged medical documents that certified they tested negative for coronavirus in advance of travel. On another recent flight, from Nairobi to Dubai, about 100 Kenyans were reportedly found with similar falsified documents and half later tested positive at the airport, according to Kenyan website Nairobi news. Kenya has recorded 80,102 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 1,427 deaths since the pandemic began. On Thursday a further 780 infections were reported, according to the Kenyan health ministry. New restrictions on public gatherings were introduced on Thursday. The number of guests allowed to attend weddings has been reduced to 50 and no more than 100 mourners may attend a funeral. Meanwhile church services are now limited to a maximum of 90 minutes.","Officials have arrested 21 people accused of attempting to use fake ""Covid-free certificates"" to travel from Kenya to the United Arab Emirates."
"Many of tens of thousands of people who took part in Sunday's rally outside the government have left, but hundreds remained, putting up tents overnight. The rally followed the release by the opposition of covert recordings which appear to show ministers plotting vote-rigging and the cover-up of a murder. Mr Gruevski denies the allegations. The government says the opposition is trying to destabilise the country for its own benefit. Power struggle in Macedonia Mr Gruevski's supporters are planning their own demonstration in Skopje on Monday. Adding to the political instability, last weekend eight police officers and 14 ethnic Albanian fighters were killed in clashes in the city of Kumanovo. 'No price' On Sunday night a long row of tents was seen near the illuminated government building, the BBC's Guy De Launey in Skopje reports. Our correspondent adds that opposition leader Zoran Zaev was sitting at a picnic table, surrounded by supporters. He told the BBC he would spend the night there. ""Freedom and democracy have no price for us,"" opposition supporter Mirjana Janov was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. ""And we will not stop until we see this dictator resigning,"" she added. Earlier on Sunday, demonstrators carried both Macedonian and Albanian flags in a show of unity. Police in riot gear were stationed near the protests. There were no reports of violence. In 2001, Macedonia was on the brink of civil war when armed rebels demanded greater rights for the Albanian minority, which makes up about a quarter of Macedonia's 2.1 million population. 'Coup attempt' Last week, two ministers and the head of the intelligence service resigned. Opposition leaders said intelligence chief Saso Mijalkov and Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska were behind attempts to control the press, judiciary and electoral officials by tapping their phones. Mr Zaev has been releasing a steady stream of recordings since February. His party accuses the government of wiretapping 20,000 people, including politicians, journalists and religious leaders. He says that scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover-ups of killings. He argues that the abuse of power allegations are so serious that the prime minister has to resign and call new elections. Opposition parties have boycotted parliament since accusing the governing coalition of fraud in the April 2014 election. But Mr Gruevski, who has won successive elections since 2006, has repeatedly rejected the allegations. He has accused Mr Zaev of orchestrating a coup at the behest of unnamed foreign spy agencies who, he says, want to overthrow his conservative government.",Demonstrators in the Macedonian capital Skopje have vowed to continue their protest until long-serving Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski resigns.
"The FBI is reportedly investigating whether Jane Sanders lied to financiers while securing a loan for a college which she led. Mr Sanders told CNN: ""It's a sad state of affairs in America when not only we have politicians being destroyed, but when you go after people's wives. The couple are understood to have hired high-profile Washington lawyers. Mr Sanders, a senator for Vermont, has previously called the inquiry politically motivated. The FBI investigation stems from a January 2016 complaint by Brady Toensing, who was chairman of the Trump campaign in Vermont. Mr Toensing suggested that Jane Sanders had lied about having enough donor support to repay a $10m (£7.7m) loan to buy land to expand Burlington College, where she served as president. The Republican lawyer also claimed Mr Sanders' office convinced the bank to lend the funds. Mrs Sanders' seven-year tenure at the liberal arts school ended in 2011. It closed in 2016 after struggling to make the repayments. Mr Sanders told CNN presenter Erin Burnett on Tuesday: ""When she came to that college, it was failing financially and academically. ""When she left it, it was in better shape. ""Five years later, just at the moment - coincidentally, no doubt - when I am a candidate for president of the United States, Donald Trump's campaign manager, vice-chairman of the Republican Party in Vermont, launched this investigation,"" he added. Mr Sanders refused to even confirm there is an investigation, concluding the interview: ""I think it's pathetic that when people are involved in public life, it's not only they get attacked, but it is their wives and their families that get attacked. ""That's what this is about."" He insisted his ""wife is about the most honest person I know"".

"Mr Li reached Ethiopia on Sunday in the first leg of his week-long tour. He will also visit Nigeria, Angola and Kenya. The premier promised Ethiopia that China would help the country to construct more power plants and roads. Both countries also signed agreements in other sectors such as agriculture and industrialisation, reports say. Papers appear to be trying hard to reject what they call the ""West's propaganda"" that ""China is colonising Africa"". ""China has a tradition of being kind to Africa,"" an article in the Beijing Times comments. ""China will not colonise Africa like Western countries did before and is not interested in the so-called neo-colonialism. China only wants to provide aid to Africa and help in its development. We take from Africa, but we don't forget to give back… We urge other Western nations to treat Africa well,"" it adds. However, the Global Times' Chinese edition points out that some Chinese businessmen in Africa are ""not too concerned with their country's image"". ""China needs to build a positive image in local communities of different African countries, and all Chinese nationals working in the continent need to play a part in it,"" it urges. The paper adds that ""more official visits of different levels are needed. We should also support more state-owned enterprises and companies with good reputations to go there."" Youth Day Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping urged the country's youth to ""improve their moral character"" in his lecture to mark China's Youth Day on Sunday. The president interacted with students at Peking University in Beijing after giving his lecture. ""Don't dream of getting rich if you want to be a government official,"" he said. Media outlets seem to be backing Mr Xi's call. ""By saying this, Mr Xi is telling all the young people in the country that they have to cultivate sound values and maintain a right attitude,"" the Changjiang Net, a news portal of the Hubei provincial government, says. The website adds that those planning to become government officials must listen to the president. ""This is also a warning to present officials as well to those who wish to become leaders of the party in the future. The aspirants are wrong if they think that they can become rich by being in the government. In other words, one should not think that being rich is the ultimate reason to become a government official,"" it says. And finally, 11 Uighur students have written an open letter condemning the bomb attack at Urumqi's south railway station on Wednesday. China says Uighur separatists were behind the attack. The authorities believe two of the attackers, who were among the dead, had come under the influence of ""extremist religious thought and participated in extremist religious activities"". The letter, entitled ""We will no longer remain silent"", was posted online on 1 May and has been widely shared on websites. ""We urge our compatriots to denounce religious extremism… We urge our countrymen in China and overseas to see clearly what tragedies such hostility has caused…,"" the students appealed in the letter.

"She said she took sole responsibility for her close friend Choi Soon-sil's access to government documents and was willing to be investigated. Ms Choi is suspected of using her friendship with Ms Park to solicit business donations for a non-profit fund she controlled. She was detained on Monday. A former aide to Ms Park was held on Thursday. A friendship too far in Seoul? On Thursday, a spokesman for Seoul Central District Court said it had accepted a request from prosecutors to issue an arrest warrant for Ms Choi, on charges of fraud and abuse of power. Prosecutors have also said they are expanding their official investigation. 'Sad thoughts trouble my sleep' The scandal has left Ms Park with an approval rating of just 5%. She has already replaced her prime minster, reshuffled her cabinet and dismissed several aides, but there are growing calls for her resignation or impeachment. Ms Park has admitted letting Ms Choi help her with speeches, without security clearance, while there are also reports that Ms Choi was closely involved in forming government policy. In a brief televised address on Friday, an emotional Ms Park again apologised, saying she ""put too much faith in a personal relationship and didn't look carefully at what was happening"". ""Sad thoughts trouble my sleep at night. I realise that whatever I do, it will be difficult to mend the hearts of the people, and then I feel a sense of shame and ask myself, 'Is this the reason I became president?'"" She said anyone found to have done wrong would be punished, and ""if necessary, I'm determined to let prosecutors investigate me and accept an investigation by an independent counsel too"". But she denied speculation that her presidency had been influenced by a cult or that shamanistic rituals had been held at the presidential compound. Ms Choi, a long-time friend of Ms Park's, is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a shadowy quasi-religious leader who was closely linked to Ms Park's father, then-president Park Chung-hee.","South Korea's President Park Geun-hye says she is ""heartbroken"" over a scandal threatening her leadership."
"By Lucy FlemingBBC News, Kano The main bus station in the Sabon Gari suburb is chaotic as thousands of people cram onto coaches heading to the east or south-west of the country. ""Kano is now closing for business because of the fear of the unknown,"" says the chairman of the bus station. They are anxious to avoid a repeat of the communal violence that followed the vote in 2011 when those from different ethnic or religious groups were singled out for attack, while many northerners in the south are also heading home. This year most residents of the mainly Muslim city are supporters of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim northerner; the people of Sabon Gari are regarded as supporters of incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner. The Igbo community, who make up the majority in the Kano suburb set aside for non-Muslim residents, has already shrunk considerably in the last few years because of an Islamist insurgency in the north-east. Originally from the east of Nigeria, they are an important part of the city's economic success, dominating sectors such as the trade in spare vehicle parts. ""Before, we had up to 50 bus companies working here but due to this insecurity some have decided to withdraw - there are less than 10 now,"" says Chairman Rufus at the Sabon Gari Motor Park, which has been targeted three times by Boko Haram militants. He says the same is true in the suburb's market as people have left fearing further attacks. 'Hustlers' ""Business is not flourishing; many have sold their sheds and gone down to areas in the east to do their business."" But some feel it is not necessarily the fear that has driven traders away, rather the lack of custom. For Odum Onuigbu, who trades in iron and steel and will be staying in Kano to vote, this has been the biggest problem. ""Igbos are hustlers, we go to many states and countries to invest,"" he says. ""Now businessmen from other countries, like Niger, Chad, Sudan and Cameroon, are no longer coming to Kano, this is why trade is down - because of the insurgency."" Telecoms engineer Ike Adiba says the security situation has also made life more expensive. ""A lot of 'strangers' have left Kano,"" he says, using the widely used word for people whose origins do not lie in Kano. Kano city population: Kano's secret drinking dens Mapping a nation divided ""What is keeping me in the north is my job and my wife's job. If I'm a businessman I would have left this town,"" Mr Adiba says, refusing to have his photo taken because of security fears. Community leaders in Sabon Gari agree that many have left because of Boko Haram, but say other people also come to try to Kano their luck. 'Not religious' Linus Okoroegbe, a businessman and secretary to the head of Kano's Igbo community, says this is because there are generally ""cordial relations"" between the majority Hausa community and those in Sabon Gari, where Sharia law does not apply. Patrick Ayelangbe, Sabon Gari community leader Our area is never taken care of and we pay so much tax Things may have been fractious when the insurgency began and Sabon Gari came under attack, but now all parts of the city have been targeted, including the Central Mosque. ""Now I think everybody has understood that Boko Haram is not religious and it is just as against Hausa Fulani as it is against Igbos or Yorubas,"" says Dr Patrick Ayelangbe, the leader of Kano's Non-Indigenes Community Leaders Association (Nicola), which represents all the city's residents who originally come from other parts of Nigeria. He believes the outspoken position of Kano's new Muslim leader, or Emir, Lamido Sanusi, has helped. ""He has come out to call a spade a spade and say: 'Listen these people are bad… they are not preaching the true Islam.' That has been a very beautiful contribution - it has been reassuring."" Peace pacts Nonetheless he says that the residents of Sabon Gari can feel like second-class citizens as the area pays more tax than the rest of the city, because of its many businesses, but sees little benefit. Sabon Gari may boast a multitude of churches with elaborate names like the Later Glory Assemblies - The Relevant Church of the Hour and The Covenant Cathedral of the Locust Army International Dwelling in Gethsemane, but many of its buildings are dilapidated. The shop fronts and flats flank roads, some with little tarmac left that are full of pot holes and gullies. ""Our area is never taken care of and we pay so much tax… the infrastructure is atrocious,"" says Dr Ayelangbe, who in the nearly 40 years he has practised at his clinic, has seen the area change from a majority Yoruba to a majority Igbo area. Nigeria decides: Presidential candidates ""In politics you tend to satisfy those who vote for you… and Sabon Gari being a non-Hausa Fulani environ, they are not too sure where their loyalty is… so invariably Sabon Gari gets nothing,"" he says. People who are not from Kano are also not entitled to free education in the state, which also rankles - and Igbo parents with children born in Kano say they struggle to get their offspring ""indigene certificates"", which would allow them scholarships. Emmanuel Nwude, who runs a non-governmental organisation promoting Nigerian unity, wants to do away with the term ""stranger"" and ""non-indigene"" altogether as he sees this as part of a mindset that fuels divisive relations. He is hopeful that peace pacts signed this year between rival parties will stop a repeat of any post-poll violence. The tension in Kano has been eased by the six-week delay to the poll, but Mr Adiba says during election season ""people throw away their cordiality"". The Sabon Gari resident says he escaped attack in February from opposition supporters because he took the precaution of carrying a small broom - the symbol of Muhammadu Buhari's All Progressives Congress. ""There is nobody from the east who is going to stay in the north during the elections. Anyone who loves his life would have to leave town."" But like others he will return afterwards: ""Kano is a very good place to stay and make your living if we can be assured of security.""","An exodus from the mainly Christian quarter of Kano, the commercial centre of northern Nigeria, is taking place ahead of elections this weekend, because of fears of violence."
"Defence Minister Panos Kammenos withdrew his party's support, signalling his opposition ahead of an expected vote in the Greek parliament. The two countries recently agreed that Greece's northern neighbour would be called North Macedonia, therefore ending a 27-year-long row. Macedonia has ratified the deal. Greek nationalists argue that the name ""Macedonia"" can only refer to the Greek province of the same name. The dispute, which has raged since it voted for independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, is blocking Macedonia's hopes of joining Nato and the European Union. Where does this leave Greece? Following the resignation of Mr Kammenos, Mr Tsipras said he was moving immediately to a confidence vote, which is expected on Wednesday, according to Greek newspaper Kathimerini. The Syriza party of Mr Tsipras has 145 seats in the 300-seat parliament and Mr Kammenos has called on his Independent Greeks (Anel) party, which has seven, to vote against the government. If the government loses, the next general election, due to be held in the autumn, could be brought forward. The main conservative opposition party, New Democracy, also opposes the new name but there is speculation that some Anel MPs, as well as some independents, may support the government in the confidence vote. Analysts say Mr Tsipras will continue with his attempt to have the new name for Macedonia ratified. Syriza, a party of the radical left which came to power on an anti-austerity platform in January 2015, was forced to accept hard economic reforms as a condition of emergency loans aimed at rescuing the country's debt-ridden economy. Greece successfully completed a three-year eurozone emergency loan programme worth €61.9bn (£55bn; $70.8bn) in August but deeply unpopular cuts to public spending are set to continue. Announcing his resignation from the cabinet, Mr Kammenos said, ""This government has completed its purpose,"" referring to the economic crisis. What's the source of the dispute? The name Macedonia already belongs to a northern region of Greece. By adopting the name in 1991, the new nation infuriated many Greeks, who suspected their northern neighbour of territorial ambitions. Greece's objections forced the United Nations to refer to Macedonia as ""the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". Athens also vetoed Macedonia's attempt to join Nato in 2008 - and blocked its EU membership ambitions. Since 1991, many suggestions have been proposed, then rejected. But a change of government in Macedonia in 2017 finally led to the deal reached last year. Under the proposed agreement, the country's language will be called Macedonian and its people known as Macedonians (citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia). The new name will be used both internationally and bilaterally, so that even the 140 or more countries that recognise the name Macedonia will also have to adopt North Macedonia. In Macedonian, the name is Severna Makedonija.",Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has said he will call a confidence vote after his governing coalition split over the Macedonia name change.
"By Nesrine KamalBBC Monitoring A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for ""atheism and espionage"". During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation ""God is Greatest"" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith. The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society. TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening. Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far. Staged terror attack Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios. In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark. In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead. In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants. The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests. This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas. Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to ""torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them"". And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank. Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case. Fatwas Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor. In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake. The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared. Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was ""unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame"". Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden. The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month. Chasing ratings Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue. But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals. The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat. It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations. As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: ""Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective.""

"The embryo was donated by a family in the US and has become the first child for a woman who would herself have been only one when the baby was conceived. The donated embryo that would become Emma Wren Gibson, a healthy baby girl, was thawed in March and transferred to mum Tina Gibson's uterus. Emma was born in November. ""Do you realise I'm only 25? This embryo and I could have been best friends,"" Mrs Gibson, now 26, of eastern Tennessee told CNN. ""I just wanted a baby. I don't care if it's a world record or not,"" she added. The faith-based National Embryo Donation Center provided the fertilised embryo, which doctors there refer to as ""snow babies"" because of how long they are kept frozen. The organisation encourages couples who do not want additional children to donate unneeded embryos after their families are complete, so that other couples can try to become parents. Tina and Benjamin Gibson turned to the Knoxville-based organisation after Mr Gibson, who has cystic fibrosis, was found to have fertility issues. Baby Emma was conceived in October 1992 - a year and half after her mum's own birth. The 24-year-old embryo is believed to have been cryopreserved for longer than any other viable human embryo. ""Emma is such a sweet miracle,"" Mr Gibson said. ""I think she looks pretty perfect to have been frozen all those years ago."" Neither parent is biologically related to their new daughter.

"A report on 38 North, a website run by the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, studied images taken between April and November. These appeared to show work in a new area of the Punggye-ri nuclear zone. But, the report said, there is no sign that any nuclear test is imminent, North Korea carried out three underground nuclear tests at Punggye-ri in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Its nuclear programme has been a source of great concern for the international community. 'Increased capability' The tunnel identified in the latest imagery is in a new area of the site, separate from three other tunnels that the North has excavated or used for tests in the past, the report said. ""While there are no indications that a nuclear test is imminent, the new tunnel adds to North Korea's ability to conduct additional detonations over the coming years if it chooses to do so,"" it added. The commercially-available satellite imagery on which the researchers based their conclusions appear to show a new tunnel entrance, the site's fourth, as well as signs of construction work taking place as recently as October and November. The report says some analysts believe each entrance connects to a single tunnel but there is debate about the exact nature and structure of the underground testing facility. It is not the first indication of construction activity at the site. In October, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a South Korean government source saying there were workers constructing a new tunnel at Punggye-ri. In September North Korea said that its reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons, had resumed normal operations. Yongbyon's reactor was shut down in 2007 but Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions.","Recent satellite images indicate that North Korea is building a new tunnel at its nuclear test site, a respected US think tank has said."
"The government has insisted that upgrades to the president's home in Nkandla were purely for security reasons but the evidence - including satellite pictures, shown below - suggest otherwise, with images showing an amphitheatre, cattle enclosure and swimming pool were all part of the work. It is believed that President Zuma has occupied the land, which sits about 24km (15 miles) south of Nkandla town, since 2000. This satellite image from 2006 shows a small collection of buildings on the land. By 2010, the number of buildings on the land had doubled. A security assessment of the property in May 2009, the same month President Zuma was sworn in, confirmed the need for a security upgrade and this increased when three new houses were built on the land later that year. This satellite image of the land in 2013 shows substantial work had been done since 2010, with a new security fence encircling the entire residence, a football pitch, helipads and swimming pool. Other additions included houses for some relatives as well as a visitors' lounge and an amphitheatre. The public protector's report said: ""The president tacitly accepted the implementation of all measures at his residence and has unduly benefited from the enormous capital investment in the non-security installations at his private residence.""",South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has been under fire for spending about $23m (£13.8m) of taxpayers' money on upgrading his rural home.

"On 20 July 1969, the Eagle module from Apollo 11 landed at Tranquility Base. Hours later, at 21:56 CT (02:56 GMT), Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to walk on the Moon. Originally inspired by the US's Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union, the mission is now remembered as an iconic moment for stargazers all over the world. 'We're breathing again' Nasa marked the anniversary by streaming footage of the launch online, giving a new generation a chance to see the historic moment that was watched by half a billion people 50 years ago. At the moment the spacecraft landed, Apollo 11 commander Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" Charlie Duke, the capsule communicator, responded from mission control in Houston: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again."" Hours later, as he first stepped on to the Moon's surface, he uttered the historic phrase: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" Armstrong was joined on the mission by his crewmates Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. All three were born in 1930. Aldrin and Collins are still alive, but Armstrong died in 2012 at the age of 82. Aldrin, the second person to walk on the Moon, tweeted on Saturday: ""Today, America put the big question to rest: We got there first. We landed on the Moon with 250 million Americans watching our backs. ""The truth is: that mission belongs to all of them, and to future generations of Americans who dream to reach the Moon once more."" Michael Collins, the third crew member, told Fox News that it's ""not very often"" he thinks about the mission. ""I lead a quiet life,"" he said. ""I'll be walking along down my street at night, when it's starting to get dark, and I sense something over my right shoulder - and I look up and see that little silver sliver up there and think, 'Oh, that's the Moon! I've been there!'"" How the world has celebrated Cities globally have held events to celebrate the landmark anniversary - including at a Nasa visitor centre in Houston, Texas. Military personnel put on a parachute display, and live bands performed. A New Year-style countdown also marked the moment of Armstrong's first steps. Artefacts from the mission have been exhibited at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, including the space suit Armstrong travelled in. The Museum of Flight in Seattle also screened the original footage of the landing, recreating a 1969 living room complete with a contemporary TV. On Friday night, a 17-minute show featuring images from the Moon landing were projected on to the Washington Monument, while crowds of people watched from the National Mall. The Grand Palais in Paris marked the anniversary with an exhibition focused on the Moon. The show, which opened in April and closes on Monday, features a giant replica of the moon that hangs from the building's glass ceiling. Artist SPY also created a giant moon for the anniversary, which is being displayed on the rooftop of a building in Madrid. '50 years after a small step for man' Earlier, in a launch coinciding with the anniversary, a Soyuz spacecraft carrying astronauts from the US, Russia and Italy took off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazazkhstan, bound for the International Space Station. At 23:48 BST, Russian space agency Roscosmos tweeted that the spacecraft had docked successfully. As the rocket launched, a Nasa presenter said: ""And lift off - 50 years after a small step for man, the Soyuz rocket and its multinational crew take a giant leap off the launch pad bound for the international space station.""",Thousands of people have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing.
"By Abdujalil Abdurasulov BBC News One week ago any debate would have been unthinkable. In authoritarian Uzbekistan, it would have been too risky to even acknowledge any health problems. But Mr Karimov's daughter Lola posted a message on Facebook saying he had suffered a brain haemorrhage. Now a nation of 31 million is facing the prospect of an Uzbekistan without President Karimov, and no named successor. In recent years any debate about the succession has inevitably been embroiled with the Karimov family's ""dirty laundry"". Until just a few years ago, many believed that Mr Karimov would be succeeded by his glamorous eldest daughter, the pop diva, fashion designer and businesswoman Gulnara Karimova. She was clearly being groomed as such and regarded as one of the most powerful people in the country. But her downfall was swift and brutal. In 2013, with allegations of corruption swirling, Ms Karimova's businesses were requisitioned, and her TV and radio channels shut down. She was also probed for corruption in cases involving hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe and US. She is now believed to be under house arrest. ""Gulnara Karimova tried to go beyond what was permitted in the system,"" Dr Eric McGlinchey, associate professor at George Mason University says. ""She tried to accumulate not just some of the economy, she tried to accumulate all of the economy. She didn't compromise, she didn't play by the rules."" Uzbekistan: Authoritarian state with an unchallenged leader Five ways to stay in power in Central Asia Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's unchallenged leader Uzbekistan opens up on president's health Gulnara Karimova: 'I have been beaten' The secret recordings of Gulnara Karimova Uzbekistan country profile As Gulnara Karimova was losing power, she accused her younger sister Lola Tillayeva-Karimova and her mother of trying to get rid of her. Many analysts say this family feud reflected a deeper power struggle in the nation. The contenders for the job Among those who Gulnara named as being behind her troubles are people who are now contenders for the job. One of them is Rustam Azimov, who is both deputy prime minister and finance minister. Mr Azimov was appointed minister back in 1998 and considered very close to Islam Karimov. Viewed as a more pro-Western voice he was the governor of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development for Uzbekistan in the 1990s. Alisher Taksanov, an Uzbek journalist who lives in Switzerland argues that Mr Azimov has a good chance also because he is from the ""Tashkent clan"". ""This clan has managed to seize all key positions in the country - interior ministry, security services, finance ministry, etc. This clan is more powerful than their rival 'Samarkand clan' headed by the Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev."" Clans in central Asia are networks based on regional loyalties and these networks are used to accumulate power and wealth, so particularly influential at times of succession. But others believe that Mr Mirziyoyev who has served as prime minister since 2003 is more likely to succeed President Karimov. ""If you look at who has more state resources, then Shavkat Mirziyoyev has better chances,"" says Kamoliddin Rabbimov, an Uzbek political analyst who used to work in the presidential administration before fleeing to France. ""He has been at this job for 13 years and appointed his people to key positions all around the country,"" Mr Rabbimov argues. Most agree that the head of the security services Rustam Inoyatov, a former KGB spy, will be a power broker. Mr Inoyatov is also one of those accused by Ms Karimova to be behind the demise of her empire. But such intrigue imparts a powerful message about how a power transfer will happen in Uzbekistan. Whoever wants to succeed President Karimov must reach a compromise with the rest of the political elite, something Gulnara Karimova refused to do. ""All things point to continuity, to someone who would be inclined to maintaining the kind of regime that Karimov created,"" Dr McGlinchey argues. ""And the reason for that, if you look at Uzbekistan, all sources of wealth [there] come from the government. People who are wealthy in Uzbekistan will have a strong incentive to maintain the system that gave them the wealth in the first place."" So the transition is largely expected to be quiet and hidden from the public and many expect the tone Mr Karimov has set, where dissent is not tolerated and any protest quashed, to continue. Indeed the successor may not necessarily be a well-known figure, analysts argue. ""This may be a compromise candidate that all power brokers are comfortable with and as a result might not be the big three that we keep hearing about,"" Dr McGlinchey says. What is clear is that the new leadership will not try to change the authoritarian system in Uzbekistan. They will continue relying on repression and state propaganda to maintain their power, just as Mr Karimov has done for 27 years.","With the only leader Uzbekistan has ever known still in hospital, and the opposition speculating he might even be dead, the focus is firmly on Islam Karimov's successor."
"The email, telling the Pentagon to ""hold off"", was sent by a senior White House official. In the phone call, Mr Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden. Mr Trump has been impeached for abuse of power over the issue. Democrats say the phone call shows Mr Trump used the office for personal political gain. A US whistleblower who heard about the conversation raised concerns, which ultimately triggered the impeachment inquiry. Mr Trump was formally impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Wednesday, but is unlikely to be removed from office as the case will go to trial in the US Senate, where his Republican party has a majority. What's in the email? The newly-released email was obtained by the Center for Public Integrity following a court order in a freedom of information case. It shows that a senior White House official, Mike Duffey, contacted senior defence officials about withholding Ukraine's aid just over an hour-and-a-half after Mr Trump ended a 25 July call with President Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call was declassified by the White House following a whistleblower complaint it was being covered-up. The transcript shows Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to ""do us a favour"" and investigate Joe Biden, currently a frontrunner to be the Democratic candidate in the 2020 White House race, and his son Hunter Biden, who had previously worked for a Ukrainian energy company. In the email Mr Duffey asks that the Department of Defense ""hold off"" on providing aid following the administration's plan to review. ""Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need to know to execute direction,"" the email reads. What has the reaction been? Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, dismissed the characterisation of the email in a statement to US media on Sunday. ""It's reckless to tie the hold of funds to the phone call. As has been established and publicly reported, the hold was announced in an interagency meeting on July 18,"" CNN quoted her as saying. ""To pull a line out of one email and fail to address the context is misleading and inaccurate."" Meanwhile the top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said the email proved the need for new witnesses and evidence at President Trump's impeachment trial. ""If there was ever an argument that we need Mr Duffey to come and testify, this is that information. This email is explosive,"" Mr Schumer said. ""A top administration official, one that we requested, is saying, stop the aid 90 minutes after Trump called Zelensky and said keep it hush, hush. What more do you need to request a witness?"" ""Until we hear from the witnesses, until we get the documents, the American people will correctly assume that those blocking their testimony were aiding and abetting a cover up, plain and simple,"" Mr Schumer added. ""So I'll close by saying this: President Trump, release the emails, let the witnesses testify, what are you afraid of?"" What happens next with impeachment? The start date of the trial is in doubt, as partisan wrangling between the parties continues. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader who will determine the terms of the trial, wants the case to be considered without testimony. But Democrats say new witnesses should be heard in the Senate, including at least four current and former White House aides with knowledge of the Ukraine affair. They want Mr McConnell to clarify whose testimony will be allowed. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, has postponed sending the impeachment charges to the Senate until the rules of the Senate trial are acceptable to her party. Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that the Democrats' case in the ""impeachment hoax"" was ""dead"" and called Ms Pelosi ""crazy Nancy"". Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the 100-seat chamber, making a conviction - which requires a two-thirds vote - extremely unlikely. Want to find out more?","The White House sought to freeze aid to Ukraine just 91 minutes after President Trump spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone in July, a newly-released government email has revealed."
"Caroline WyattReligious affairs correspondent@CarolineWyatton Twitter On Tuesday, Pope Francis will open the original Holy Door at St Peter's Basilica in Rome, the first time it has been opened since the turn of the century, to mark the official start of a year laden with symbolism for Catholics across the world. So what does it mean? The clue to the aim of the Year of Mercy is in its name: a time for the Church itself and for Catholics everywhere to show mercy and compassion, in thought and in deed, and focus on forgiveness, reconciliation and doing good in concrete ways for the needy and those on the margins of society. The crossing of the threshold of a Holy Door is a sign of spiritual renewal, and the passage from sin to grace. Pope Francis has long signalled his wish to change the Church's approach from condemnation of wrongdoing to a Church more forgiving of its flock, and more understanding of the difficulties faced by believers today. This extraordinary jubilee year is a practical way of giving expression to that wish, and creating a Church that is a ""field hospital"", healing and binding the wounds of its flock. Announcing the extraordinary jubilee this March, the Pope said: ""The greater the sin, the greater the love the Church must express,"" writing that the Holy Door is a ""Door of Mercy, through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons and instils hope."" Pope Francis took many by surprise when he announced earlier this year that as part of the jubilee, all parish priests across the world would be allowed to absolve repentant women who asked for forgiveness for having an abortion, even though Church teaching still terms abortion a grave sin. Forgiveness for abortion He has, in effect, already begun the jubilee by opening the Holy Door of the Cathedral in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, during his recent trip to Africa. It was one of many symbolic gestures he made in a nation torn by fighting between Christians and Muslims. The Pope has also made clear he wants this jubilee to open a year of ""fervent dialogue"" between Christians, Muslims and Jews, so that all who believe in a merciful God show more mercy towards one another, driving out violence, disrespect and discrimination. He said that the Christian profession of faith in God's mercy ""relates us to Judaism and Islam, both of which consider mercy to be one of God's most important attributes"". In a year marked by cruel conflicts, terrorist attacks and natural disasters across the globe, the jubilee is expected to draw millions of pilgrims to Rome, where the city authorities and the Vatican have been working together to ensure security. Earthly technology Italian security forces will be on high alert, while Rome has declared a no-fly zone for drones as well as regular aircraft, although Vatican officials say they had no knowledge of any specific or credible plot to attack the city or the Vatican. While trusting in God, the Vatican has also invested in earthly technology, with visitors having to pass through metal detectors on St Peter's Square before they can enter. Jubilee Years: Jubilee years are rooted in the Old Testament tradition of freeing slaves and prisoners once every 50 years, a concept that died out within Judaism but was taken up by Pope Boniface VIII for the Catholic Church in 1300. Pilgrimages to Rome were at the heart of the original jubilee years, and attracted hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to the city, many willing to pay for ""indulgences"" - the eradication by the Church of the spiritual debt arising from sin. It was a tradition that not only contributed copious cash to the Vatican's coffers, but also contributed to the theological turmoil that led to the establishment of rival Protestant churches across much of northern Europe. The last Jubilee was called by St John Paul II to mark the millennium, and this Holy Year of Mercy starts on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 2015 and will end on the Feast of Christ the King on 20 November 2016. In an innovation by Pope Francis, Holy Doors will also be opened this year at cathedrals, some churches and shrines around the world for those unable to make the pilgrimage to Rome. In England, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, will open the Holy Door at Westminster Cathedral, while Holy Doors will also be opened in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and many churches will hold special services on Sunday to mark the start of the jubilee.","Appropriately for the weeks of Advent leading up to Christmas, carpenters and other tradespeople have been kept busy in the run-up to the Jubilee Holy Year of Mercy, installing or ensuring that the Holy Doors, due to be opened at Roman Catholic cathedrals and churches across the world, are safe and functioning."
"By Mark DoyleBBC News, Haiti It is part of a campaign that centres on the extraordinary possibility that the UN - widely seen as a force for good around the world - may have brought cholera into Haiti and as a result may be responsible for nearly 7,000 deaths from the disease. The UN is being asked to pay $100,000 (£65,000) to the families of those who died and $50,000 (£32,500) to each of the people who fell sick but recovered. In addition there is a ""class action"" saying the UN should stop the cholera by rebuilding Haiti's decrepit water and sanitation infrastructure. If met in total, the claims could cost the international body many billions of dollars. Cholera is a disease that spreads through human waste and infected water. Victims can die within hours of the disease taking hold if they don't get treatment. The main symptom is catastrophic dehydration through diarrhoea and vomiting. 'Dire conditions' My journey here began in the pretty mountaintop town of Mirebalais, source of the original infection. No-one contests that this is the area where the outbreak began last October. But where exactly? The mayor of the town, Lochard Laguerre, has no doubts: ""We know that sanitary conditions in the Nepalese UN camp just outside town were dire,"" he told me. ""They were dumping their sewage near the river and we know that people die from cholera in Nepal. I told the UN commander in the camp about our concerns a week or so before the first outbreak began."" Inside the Mirebalais UN camp, the current officer in charge, Lt Col Tek Chand of the Nepalese army, contested the mayor's account. ""It's impossible. It didn't start here,"" he said. Lt Col Tek Chand was not in charge of the camp when the outbreak began - another Nepalese officer was here. ""There has not been a single case of cholera in this camp,"" he insisted. In the camp, technicians were monitoring a new, modern sewage treatment plant recently installed by the UN. At the time of the cholera outbreak, however, the Nepalese had a contract with a Haitian waste-disposal company that was dumping raw sewage into an open pit outside the camp. A report by independent experts commissioned by the UN in New York said sanitary conditions at the camp in Mirebalais were insufficient to prevent the spread of infection into the Artibonite River - Haiti's biggest. The experts' report also said the strain of cholera that hit Haiti was similar to an Asian strain. Before this outbreak, the experts said, Haiti had not had cholera for nearly 100 years. 'Fingers pointed' In the capital Port-au-Prince the UN's head of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti, Nigel Fisher, said the response to the petition was in the hands of lawyers at the UN Secretariat in New York. But he told me; ""I think we all regret the breakout of this thing and I don't think the UN has ever denied the possibility [that it could have been at fault]."" ""However I would like to know with some certainty what the source was,"" he added. He said that describing it as an ""Asian strain"" was not helpful. ""The cholera strain we have in Haiti is the same as the one they have in Latin America and Africa. They all derive from Bangladesh in the 1960s so they are all an Asian strain."" He said every moment he spent trying to establish the exact cause of the outbreak was time he was not spending with his humanitarian team tackling the crisis that was still taking lives. ""Fingers are being pointed"", Nigel Fisher accepts, ""and in the court of pubic opinion in Haiti, the UN is already guilty"". He was certainly right there. Every single Haitian I met during my two week visit was convinced the UN was responsible. A protest by about 2,000 people was held outside the UN base in the coastal town of Saint Marc. ""Down with the UN,"" people shouted and sang, ""they brought us cholera."" ""I'm here because my father died of cholera,"" said one of the protesters, Pierre Filsmichel. ""My dad left seven children and a wife. He was the breadwinner of our family, and because of cholera he is now dead. We ask for compensation for all the cholera victims."" There are technical question marks around the culpability of the United Nations in this affair. Although some scientific experts say the Nepalese base was the source of the cholera, others say they cannot be certain. A senior UN official, who requested anonymity, pointed out that it was possible for someone to be a cholera carrier without knowing it. If this had been the case, the UN official said, the source could have been either an unknowing Nepali - or an unknowing Haitian, or anybody else in the country. Another UN official, who also asked not to be named, said that following a series of internal reports, seen by most senior UN managers, ""everyone knew the sanitary situation in the Nepali base was deplorable"". The legal case currently takes the form of a petition under civil law asking the UN to set up a joint UN/Haitian Government commission to hear the cases. If the civil case is not heard by the joint commission soon, the lawyers say, they will take the matter to court in the United States. You can hear Mark Doyle's full report Who is responsible for the deadly cholera outbreak in Haiti? by listening to the Assignment programme on the BBC World Service on Thursday 15 December at 09:05 GMT.","Lawyers representing thousands of cholera victims in Haiti have threatened to take the United Nations to court in the United States, unless the international body responds to a petition for financial compensation."
"By Nick ThorpeBBC News, Albania Now 16, she was kidnapped by her father Shkelzen and taken to Syria when she was nine. After seven years of war and then captivity, she looks like she is from another world, capable of nothing, or anything. We cannot print her photograph because it might endanger her life. She is still in the al-Hol camp in northern Syria, where she was taken with over 70,000 other orphans and widows of jihadist Islamic State fighters, when Barghuz, the last IS stronghold, fell in March 2019. Her brother Endri, 14, is luckier. He was brought home from Syria by Albanian special forces in late October 2020, with a woman and three other children. Frail, thin as a rake, he grins with his uncle Xhetan, who is barely able to believe he can hold his nephew again in his arms. ""That camp,"" Albanian Interior Minister Sander Lleshaj tells me, ""is hell on Earth, as witnessed by our police officers."" In the UK, the al-Hol camp is better known as the temporary home of former London schoolgirl and ""IS bride"" Shamima Begum, who joined the jihadists in 2015 and later had her UK citizenship revoked. 'Moral obligation' The interior minister in Tirana says it is currently home to 30 Albanian children and 10 Albanian women - and the bottom line for Albania is to get all the children home in the next few months. ""We think there is a moral obligation to repatriate at least the kids, because they are not terrorists, they are victims of their irresponsible parents,"" he told the BBC. ""But they could be raised up into real monsters if we leave them in the camps and ignore them."" Their mothers, on the other hand, should face trial, he believes. Negotiations are going on with both the Kurdish authorities, who run the camps, and the mothers to allow repatriation. I meet Xhetan in the lobby of a Tirana hotel. His hands shake as he shows pictures of the children on his phone. He has dedicated seven years of his life to getting the children home. He has negotiated with smugglers, militiamen, and aid agencies, but it was his own government in the end which delivered. But now it's a race against time to get the other children out, either before they are harmed in the camp, or spirited away to form the core of a new IS. The Kurdish authorities running al-Hol are losing control. 'We never talk about conflict' Across the border in Gostivar in North Macedonia, I meet Habib Fidani. His brother Bekim abandoned the family pizza and pie business in 2013 to fight first for al-Nusra Front in Syria, and later for IS. Habib hasn't heard from his brother for two years, since he was taken captive by Kurdish forces. But he knows that Bekim's wife and four children - Fidan, Usama, Adnan and Reyana - are still alive in Camp Roj, a smaller and slightly less dangerous place than al-Hol. Reyana, now five, is the only one born in Syria. ""Just two days ago, they sent me a text. We never talk about the conflict. Only about family matters."" Habib's mother travelled to Syria to try to bring the children back. She died there of illness. His father tried to get them back too, travelling widely in the region, negotiating - like Xhetan from Tirana - with anyone who would speak to him, but he died last year too. Now Habib has taken over the task on behalf of the family. His main hope lies in the efforts of the Albanian government but, as the interior minister told me, those efforts are focused exclusively on Albanian citizens, not on ethnic Albanians from North Macedonia and Kosovo. In 2018, the Kosovo government managed, with US mediation, to bring back over 100 women and children from Syria. Can de-radicalisation help? In the Macedonian capital Skopje, Samet Shabani of the Bridge-Horizon NGO works for a de-radicalisation programme for the small number of former fighters and their family members who have returned from Syria, mostly under their own steam. ""Fighters who have come home from those battlefields to the Balkans feel like [they're] native to this country,"" he says, arguing that their strong Albanian national identity helps former fighters and their families shed the kind of militant Islamist brainwashing they were exposed to in the Middle East. The de-radicalisation work was funded by the UK government until April 2019, when the programme ended. The Dutch government, the Islamic community in North Macedonia and the prison authorities are now taking the work forward. In early November, a 20-year-old ethnic Albanian, Kujtim Fejzullai, born in Austria to second-generation migrants from North Macedonia, opened fire on passers-by in downtown Vienna, killing four people and injuring 23 others. Fejzulai had served eight months of a 20-month sentence for trying to join IS fighters in Syria. He had been radicalised in Austria. ""This illustrates my point exactly,"" says Samet Shabani. ""If we do not rehabilitate, reintegrate and re-socialise those fighters, we will end up, unfortunately, with such dramatic incidents in other countries as well.""","Eva's pale, triangular face glows in the frame created by her coal-black shawl and hood. Her pale brown eyes gaze straight into the camera."
"By Vincent NiBBC News ""I like rightists,"" Mao told Nixon. ""I am comparatively happy when these people on the right come into power."" Four decades after that historic meeting, China is watching the rise of another ""rightist"" in the US in Donald Trump, who expresses his love for China while also blaming it for much of America's economic woes. Premier Li Keqiang has said the US election ""has been lively and has caught the eye"", but many in China see it as more than that. They see the flamboyant New York billionaire as an inspiration rather than an antagonist. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade. China dumps everything that they have over here...."" Even before Mr Trump declared his intention to run for the presidency, the name Trump was well known in China. In Henan province, there is a property management consulting firm called Trump Consulting. It has no connection with Mr Trump, but says on its website it is inspired by his property empire. There is also a company in southern China, Shenzhen Trump Industries, that produces smart toilet seats and bathroom fixtures for high-end hotels, and Trump Electronics, a company based in eastern Anhui Province, has been making air purifiers since 1996, according to People's Daily. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump has more than 14,000 fans on microblogging site Sina Weibo. There is also a Trump Weibo fan page that is dedicated to ""everything Trump"". 'Worries the whole world' There is no reliable opinion poll on how Mr Trump's comments are received in China, but state media are watching him with a degree of schadenfreude. A recent Xinhua report said his rise showed ""the limitations of the 'democracy' that Americans have long boasted about"". After he won a huge margin in Super Tuesday primaries, state-owned newspaper Global Times ran an English-language piece saying it was ""solid proof that US voters are tired of Washington politics"". ""It is probably on this point that Chinese public finds Trump somewhat more agreeable,"" wrote Ai Jun. But he added that ""in the normal run of events, Chinese people should reject an arrogant, hawkish candidate like him out of hand"". Last week, the newspaper went further, issuing a stern warning that ""the rise of a racist in the US political arena worries the whole world"". ""The US had better watch itself for not being a source of destructive forces against world peace, rather than pointing fingers at other countries for their so-called nationalism and tyranny."" They tell me, 'You can't really build a wall, can you?' And I say, 'China, thirteen thousand miles, the Great China Wall, the Wall of China, right? "" 'Not a bad president' But many on the Chinese internet think that perhaps the media isn't treating Mr Trump fairly. ""He tore down the hypocritical masks of many Americans,"" says Weibo user ClairvoyanceCard. ""Every sentence he said is true, but they are not all pleasant to hear."" His down-to-earth attitude when he meets voters certainly appeals to many in a country where politicians are remote and rarely mingle with citizens at rallies. Shanghai-based corporate lawyer Wei Li, who spent 10 years living in the US, tells the BBC that Mr Trump ""is really speaking for heartland Americans, and he is a rare politician who speaks in plain English"". Mr Li says American election politics is ""like a theatre"" and rational politics will ultimately triumph over rhetoric. ""Trump's pragmatism, his access to information, his smartness as well as good counsel may translate into good decisions, should he win,"" he says. Sijia Liu, a veteran radio host and commentator who has millions of daily listeners in Beijing, agrees. ""Perhaps Trump will be the president who makes politics understandable to ordinary people,"" Ms Liu says. ""In America, even though you are the president, you cannot behave recklessly."" ""So I wouldn't worry that Trump might become a bad president."" A recent widely circulated article on Chinese messaging network WeChat also provides some insights into the Trump phenomenon. In it, author Wan Weigang claimed he read Mr Trump's book - Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again - and concluded that, among all Republican candidates, his political ideas were actually ""the mildest"". In other words, Mr Wan thinks Mr Trump is not as hawkish as he appears to be. ""Before Obama became president, he wrote a book called The Audacity of Hope, and he used 'change' in his first term and 'hope' in the second to galvanise Americans,"" he continues. ""But what kind of change and hope that Obama has brought to Americans? Where is his audacity now? Americans have already been bored of such politicians."" I would get China to make [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly."" 'He is a strongman' Even among the Chinese diaspora, who might have been put off by Mr Trump's views on race and immigration, there is some admiration. ""Many people are having a hard time understanding why Trump is so popular, or have the misconception that people who support him are poorly educated, white and angry males,"" says Wendy Wang. Ms Wang moved to the US from China at the age of 25 and became a naturalised American citizen three years ago. She holds a PhD degree and is a professor at a private California university. Ms Wang tells the BBC she will ""definitely"" vote for Donald Trump as she sees him as ""the medicine America needs"". I asked what exactly it is about Mr Trump that appeals to her. Her answer: ""He's smart, honest, outspoken, and he is also a strongman."" She adds: ""He is the kid who yells that the emperor has no clothes.""","When Chairman Mao met US Republican president Richard Nixon in 1972, he expressed his fondness for right-wing politicians."
"Speaking from Switzerland, she said she was wanted for political reasons and did not think her trial would be fair. She is due to appear before a Supreme Court judge on Wednesday over her role in Catalonia's independence referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid. Several other pro-independence politicians have been imprisoned in connection with October's referendum. Others, including the sacked regional President Carles Puigdemont, are in self-imposed exile in Brussels. ""I won't go to Madrid,"" Ms Gabriel told Switzerland's Le Temps newspaper (in French). ""I'm wanted for my political activities and the government press has already declared me guilty. ""As I wouldn't get a fair trial at home, I looked for a country that could protect my rights. ""I will be more useful to my movement free than behind bars."" Ms Gabriel is a member of the left-wing separatist party Popular Unity (CUP) and is reported to be in Geneva with other party members. The party's lawyer has said the Supreme Court will be informed in writing of her decision not to attend. She says she is prepared to seek political asylum in Switzerland if she is unable to work there because of an extradition request. Her Swiss lawyer, Olivier Peter, says an extradition request would be illegal because her trial is on political grounds. The Supreme Court has not yet commented. Ms Gabriel is one of several Catalan politicians called to appear in court this week, facing possible charges of sedition and rebellion. Pro-independence parties called a referendum on the issue in October, which was met with a heavy police crackdown and attracted global attention. The Spanish government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government and called new elections, but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority.

"Matthew Disney attempted to climb Western Europe's highest mountain with the machine on 30 August. But as he neared the summit, weather conditions were too bad to continue carrying it. A local mayor complained that it would have to be removed from the peak by helicopter. However, Mr Disney insists he fully intends to retrieve the device. His aim had been to climb to the summit of the mountain and then row the 4,810m (15,780ft) height of the mountain to raise money for veterans' causes, he told the BBC. After reaching a shelter at 4,418m, the weather window he had been given lasted seven to eight hours less than planned, leaving visibility at just 50m. ""I spoke to others and I then turned around. Safety is paramount to me. Even more so for others and the fact that I was carrying the rowing machine. I made a decision that the safety of others' lives was more paramount. I went down to place the rower in the shelter,"" he said. Mr Disney, from Blackpool, reached the summit without the machine, he explained, before telling the manager of the shelter about his decision. He argued that the shelter was fairly large and the rowing machine was not obstructive. In an open letter, the local mayor of Saint-Gervais Les Bains, Jean-Marc Peillex announced he would be sending the bill for the machine's removal to the British Embassy in Paris. The cost for the operation has been reported as €1,800 (£1,642) to remove it by helicopter. ""If the British want to leave Europe, first they have to settle their debts,"" he was quoted as saying. 'Restore peace to Mont Blanc' The mayor urged President Emmanuel Macron to take action against people misusing the mountain. In June, two Swiss climbers landed a small plane just east of the summit and then hiked to the top. He said the president should pass a law immediately to ""punish those who break the law, and restore peace to Mont Blanc"". However, Mr Disney said he already had plans in place to retrieve the machine and had been in contact with the manager of the shelter. He said he had found the appropriate team to collect it but he was confident he had the skills to bring it down himself. ""I've been to 13 countries' highest mountains with the rowing machine. I have appreciation for nature and mountains as a whole. I'm not there to make a mockery of the mountain. I do feel like the mayor has blown this out of proportion. My intentions were to raise awareness of causes for veterans."" It's not the first time that a bizarre object has been left on a mountain: Mont Blanc attracts nearly 25,000 climbers every year. So far this year at least three climbers have died on the mountain.

"The report cited research finding indigenous women were 12 times more likely to be killed or to disappear than other women in Canada. The inquiry blamed the crisis on deep-rooted colonialism and state inaction. Among more than 200 recommendations is a call for all Canadians to help end violence, including by learning indigenous history. The 1,200-page document released Monday is the culmination of almost three years of hearings and research by the inquiry into disproportionate violence faced by indigenous women and girls in Canada. ""Despite their different circumstances and backgrounds, all of the missing and murdered are connected by economic, social, and political marginalisation, racism and misogyny woven into the fabric of Canadian society,"" said Marion Buller, chief commissioner of the inquiry. It cost C$92m ($67m; £53m), and heard from more than 2,000 witnesses since 2017 - including survivors of violence and family members. What's the background? Mr Trudeau's government launched the national inquiry in September 2016, after years of calls for one by indigenous and international organisations. Notable cases of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls had fuelled the call for a national inquiry, including the Vancouver murders by Robert Pickton, and the death of schoolgirl Tina Fontaine. In 2015, a landmark Truth and Reconciliation report into the legacy of residential schools in Canada issued a damning verdict - that the policy amounted to ""cultural genocide"". Monday's document takes that finding a step further saying that the murder and disappearance indigenous women and girls over the past few decades has amounted to a ""race-based genocide of indigenous peoples"". How was Canada found to be complicit? The report found that ""persistent and deliberate human and indigenous rights violations and abuses are the root cause behind Canada's staggering rates of violence"". Past inquiries and investigations in Canada - from the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples to the more recent Truth and Reconciliation report - have put forward about 900 wide-ranging recommendations to deal with many of the underlying issues. Many have never been applied. ""One of the family members' and survivors' biggest fears in opening themselves up to this process as intense as this one is that in the end, nothing is done - the report gathers dust on a shelf and the recommendations are left unanswered,"" the final report said. Victims' voices finally heard By Jessica Murphy, BBC News in Ottawa The document released by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is dense, at well over 1,000 pages. But - as is often the case - it's the personal stories that cut through the formal language. The voices of some of the families were included in the report, bringing emotional weight to the two phone directory-sized volumes. ""Tamara Lynn Chipman stole her daddy's heart from the moment she was born,"" begins a foreword by Gladys Radek. ""She grew into a tall, lanky, charming, beautiful young lady with a smile that would brighten anybody's day."" Tamara vanished on 21 September, 2005, along the Highway of Tears in the province of British Columbia, a route notorious for the number of women who have gone missing or died along its 724 km (450 miles). Or the words of Jeremiah Bosse - widower of Daleen Bossee - who admits to early doubts about the inquiry: ""Will this actually work or help?"" He writes: ""Today I feel hopeful for the first time that as victims of violence our words will be heard. The words of our loved ones are spoken."" What's the reaction? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - who has made reconciliation with indigenous peoples a priority for his government - thanked those that shared stories with the commission, and vowed to enact the inquiry's recommendations. ""This is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day,"" he said. Mr Trudeau did not mention genocide in his speech - a fact that was not lost on Michèle Audette, one of the report's commissioners. ""I was hoping that he would have that courage,"" she said during a press conference. Today was a long time coming for many victims and their family. ""This journey has been emotional but also uplifting, because I've been able to share this day with all these families,"" Shelia LeDoux told the BBC. Her niece went missing in 1992, but her remains were not found until four years later. ""Her voice is silent but I feel like I'm her voice, and I feel like I've carried forward with what I've promised."" Barbara Sevigny, whose sister was murdered 33 years ago, said today validated the pain she and her family have experienced. ""Our lives matter too. That became very real,"" she told the BBC, her voice cracking. She said she is has been disillusioned by broken promises in the past, and is waiting to see what steps the government will take. What does the report recommend? The chief commissioner said that nothing short of a ""paradigm shift"" is necessary to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society. Ms Buller urged Canadians: ""Read the report, speak out against sexism, racism, and misogyny. Hold government to account and decolonise yourself by learning about indigenous people and the true history of Canada."" The inquiry called on the federal government to create an independent mechanism for reporting annually on how the recommendations are being implemented. Other recommendations include:","Canada is complicit in a ""race-based genocide"" against indigenous women, a government inquiry has found."
St Sampson's Harbour and Belle Greve Bay have been identified as the areas at greatest risk of flooding due to the lack of natural and built defences. Flooding in these areas could cut the main coast road between the north and south of the island and damage residential and commercial properties. Interested companies have been asked to tender for a two-month contract.,The first stage of a £50m project to stop flooding along Guernsey's coastal areas could start in August.
"An internal inquiry found 30 teams worked for more than two years to try to ensure a conservative candidate won. Park Geun-hye did beat liberal Moon Jae-in, but she is now facing trial for corruption and abuse of power and Mr Moon has replaced her. Former spy chief Won Sei-hoon is currently on trial for a second time for trying to manipulate the election. He was sentenced to three years in jail in 2015. The conviction was overturned on appeal and the new trial was ordered. The in-house investigators at the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said the agency had hired internet experts to try to sway public opinion through social media postings. The operation was intended to ensure that outgoing President Lee Myung-bak was succeeded by another conservative. Ms Park won by a narrow margin. ""The teams were charged with spreading pro-government opinions and suppressing anti-government views, branding them as attempts by pro-North Korean forces' to disturb state affairs,"" the investigating team said. It also found that the NIS had tried to influence parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2012, as well as placing some opposition politicians under surveillance. The new president has vowed to reform the NIS, and the new spy agency chief has pledged to end any involvement in domestic politics. However, a spokesman for Ms Park's party said the inquiry itself showed the NIS continued to interfere. The spokesman, Kang Hyo-sang, said: ""The NIS says it will dissociate itself from politics but it is meddling in politics again by starting this probe."" Ms Park was charged in April with bribery, coercion, abuse of power and leaking state secrets. She is accused of allowing close friend Choi Soon-sil to extort money from companies in return for political favours. She denies the charges.",South Korea's spy agency has admitted it tried to manipulate the result of the 2012 presidential election.
"In tests carried out on arrival, 65 were found to have Covid-19. Twenty tested negative, and a further nine will receive their results later. The migrants - thought to be from Eritrea, Morocco and Sudan - were reported to have been at sea for 30 hours before being picked up when their vessel started taking on water. They will remain in quarantine at a reception centre. ""Migrants arriving by boat are immediately quarantined for 14 days and tested. The migrants who are positive will continue to be isolated and the rest will remain in quarantine and followed up,"" the health ministry said. The group had reportedly set off from Libya in a small boat. They were only discovered after sending out a distress signal. ""This group arrived in Malta together and were in contact with very few other people before they were tested,"" the ministry added, playing down the likelihood of locals getting infected. The new cases mean that Malta's total of active cases has shot up to 99, AFP news agency reports. It was the single largest cluster of positive cases detected on the small island since the first person tested positive on 7 March. The previous record one-day total of new cases was 52 in April. There have been nine recorded virus deaths on Malta. When the pandemic was at its height in Europe, the country of 450,000 locked down its ports completely, including to rescued migrants.",More than two thirds of a group of 94 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean by the Maltese coastguard have tested positive for coronavirus.
"It's noticeable soon after you land in Washington - the city is full of Ethiopians. Their ubiquitous presence - behind the counter at Starbucks or the wheels of taxis - in the bastion of American government symbolises the two pillars of this alliance. The Ethiopian diaspora across America - the second largest community after Nigerians - has played an enormous role in influencing ongoing political reforms that have rocked Ethiopia since the beginning of 2018. These have included the opening of borders, the freeing of political prisoners, the lifting of restrictions on media, and the opening of political space to previously banned groups, as well as a significant redistribution of power within the ruling coalition government. Expatriate Ethiopians run numerous TV stations and online media which are beamed into Ethiopian homes or to smartphones more than 11,000 kilometres away in the motherland - often, in the past, with a message critical of the government. At the same time, US foreign policy significantly influenced last year's seismic events and is helping the Ethiopian government prepare the country for crucial national elections in 2020. A US House of Representative Congressional Delegation (Codel) has recently returned from a visit to Ethiopia and Eritrea. During that visit, US Ambassador to Ethiopia Michael Raynor announced the US will be ""embedding senior US government officials at key Ethiopian economic ministries and operations for a sustained period of time"". Last month, the ambassador also visited the site of the Ethiopian Airlines crash to pay respect to the lives lost and offer messages of condolence and support to those working on the investigation. A unique relationship ""No other African country has this sort of relationship with the US,"" says Tewodrose Tirfe, chair of the Amhara Association of America, a US-based advocacy group for the Amhara, Ethiopia's second-largest ethnic group. ""Because Ethiopia was not colonised, it was able to have a formal direct relationship with the US that goes back to 1903 when the US representative handed his papers to Emperor Menelik."" US influence in Ethiopia includes a sizeable financial component. Not including funding for security - the size of which isn't known - Ethiopia has received about $4bn (£3bn) from the US government over the last five years towards humanitarian issues and development. Meanwhile, remittances from Ethiopia's global diaspora was estimated in 2017 at $4.6bn, according to a report commissioned by the European Union. The largest portion originates from the US because of the number of people and the fact they are more wealthy than diaspora elsewhere, says Mr Tewodrose. Flowing through informal channels, much of that money moves between relatives but some goes towards supporting political opposition in Ethiopia - including armed resistance - all in the name of freedom. ""Living in the US has a tremendous influence on how I perceive democracy and freedom of speech,"" says Gennet Negussie with the Ethiopian Advocacy Network, a grassroots collection of organisations promoting democracy, human rights and justice in Ethiopia, who has lived in the US since 1988. ""My experience in the US has opened my eyes and created a desire to get involved in changing the authoritarian government in Ethiopia and helping with the democratisation of Ethiopia so people have a say in the political system."" Successive waves of emigration during decades of tumult in Ethiopia have formed a worldwide Ethiopian diaspora of around two million people. Though there is no census data, a million are estimated to live in the US, of whom about 250,000 are concentrated across Washington DC, Virginia and Maryland. ""Ethiopians came to the US for the same reasons as others, because it symbolises the ideals of freedom, respect for human rights, better opportunities for their children and that notion that if you work hard enough, there's no limit to what you can accomplish,"" says Mr Tewodrose. ""And the stories of those who are successful, becoming engineers, professors, doctors, go back to Ethiopia and encourage others to try for the same experiences."" Ethiopians entered the US through various means ranging from the granting of political asylum and student visas to sponsorship from US organisations. While some entered through undocumented channels or on travel visas and stayed afterwards, official immigrant applications from Ethiopians have done well historically. More voices on Ethiopia: ""The Ethiopian diaspora established a good reputation for being hardworking and enterprising, excelling in performance, valuing education, providing community service and establishing churches,"" says Bonnie Holcomb, an anthropologist affiliated at George Washington University who has researched the Ethiopian diaspora for decades. ""They integrated well, were not isolated, and showed they were not going to be a drain on the US coffers."" Diaspora politics Across all generations the Ethiopian diaspora includes the likes of myriad journalists, bloggers, activists and academics, all closely following and often commenting on events in Ethiopia. Last year's reforms mean some of them who previously couldn't return to Ethiopia are now doing so, including exiled leaders of previously banned political parties. Ginbot 7, one of the most prominent, was founded in 2008 by Berhanu Nega, a university professor at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, and another Ethiopian exile, Andargachew Tsege, in Washington DC, before the group based itself in Eritrea. Similarly, the Oromo Liberation Front, another major opposition group, maintained an office in Washington DC while operating a military camp in Eritrea. During protests between 2015 and 2018, Ivy League-educated Jawar Mohammed played a pivotal role in orchestrating Ethiopia's National Youth Movement for Freedom and Democracy - popularly known as the Qeerroo - young Oromo activists at the heart of protests and strikes that brought down Ethiopia's previous prime minister. Throughout these protests the US-based diaspora also lobbied the US government - while reaching out to human rights organisations and international media - to put additional pressure on the Ethiopian government. Finally, in 2018, a week after the 2 April swearing-in of Abiy Ahmed as Ethiopia's new prime minister, the US House of Representatives unanimously adopted a resolution that was unusually outspoken for US public policy in its criticism of Ethiopia's government. The resolution - known as HR-128 - condemned excessive use of force by Ethiopian security forces; the detention of journalists, students, activists and political leaders; and the regime's abuse of anti-terrorism laws to stifle political and civil dissent and journalistic freedoms. ""If you look at the reforms that followed in Ethiopia, they basically matched one for one the points in the resolution,"" says Mr Tewodrose, whose organisation collaborated closely with US lawmakers supporting the resolution. ""We the diaspora know that by being here, in the world's most powerful country, we can try leverage that to influence things in Ethiopia, because the policy the US takes will likely be followed by other countries."" A country of enormous consequence That said, the US diplomatic relationship with Ethiopia has had its ups and downs. The US was a strong ally of Emperor Haile Selassie - Ethiopian soldiers fought with the allies during World War Two and alongside Americans during the Korean War - but after he was overthrown by a military coup in 1974, Ethiopia pivoted to Russia for arms and financial and ideological sustenance. Following the 1991 revolution that defeated the military regime and brought in the present government, Ethiopia was back with the US. Since 2001 and the 9/11 attacks, the US-Ethiopia relationship has strengthened with Ethiopia viewed as a vital bulwark against the spread of radical Islam and terrorism in the Horn of Africa. ""The US has understood for many years that Ethiopia is a country of enormous consequence,"" says Mr Raynor, the US ambassador to Ethiopia. ""A country with a large territory and a large population; a country with enormous potential and a rapidly growing economy; and a country that has played an outsized role in keeping the peace in Africa - and beyond - for many years,"" But some commentators say the ongoing shake-up in Ethiopian politics could affect US-Ethiopia relations, added to which US foreign policy in Africa has shifted to looking more at the rise of China and Russia, and not terrorism, as the biggest threat. The relationship remains very strong, says Sandy Wade, a former European Union diplomat in Addis Ababa. ""US diplomats have won the respect of Ethiopian authorities by not speaking out publicly while making constructive criticisms in private."" That has never been the style of US-based Ethiopian media, which has a history of being one-sided and virulently anti-government. This has led, some argue, to worsening ethnic tensions, especially negative perceptions of the Tigrayan minority group due to its association with the Tigray People's Liberation Front party that formerly dominated the government. Ethnic tensions are one of the biggest of many challenges facing Ethiopia's reforming government, Mr Tewodrose says. But he remains, like those at the US embassy in Addis Ababa, buoyant about the country's emerging prospects. ""Ethiopia is in the midst of a moment unlike anything I've seen in my career - the opportunity to reinvent a country of great size and consequence into a true democracy,"" Mr Raynor says. ""We feel strongly that the US has both an opportunity and an obligation to do everything we can to support the success of this moment. ""Ultimately, it'll be up to the Ethiopian people to see it through,"" Mr Raynor adds, ""but we will be absolutely be by their side, every step of the way.""","A high-level US delegation just returned from Ethiopia, which is arguably America's closest ally on the continent of Africa.

"Kerryn Phelps, a local doctor and popular independent candidate, comfortably won the Wentworth seat. ""This win tonight should signal a return of decency, integrity and humanity to the Australian government,"" she told supporters. Australia has had six prime ministers in eight years, and now faces further uncertainty. How has the governing party reacted? Prime Minister Scott Morrison's ruling Liberal Party had been fighting to hold Wentworth, which was vacated by his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. The result means the centre-right party will need to rely on independent MPs to survive confidence votes. Two have already vowed not to back Mr Morrison. Speaking at the HQ of Liberal candidate Dave Sharma, Mr Morrison said it had been a ""tough day"" and the result was ""not unexpected"". ""Liberals are angry and they've expressed that,"" he said. ""We will work constructively with all of those on the crossbench, as we always have... The Liberal-National government will be back at work on Monday."" A thumbs-down to back-stabbing Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News, Sydney Revenge. The people of Wentworth have sent a blunt message to Australia's political class that back-stabbing and party dysfunction won't be tolerated. The defeat of Dave Sharma, the governing Liberal candidate in the Sydney by-election, is an act of retribution by voters furious and frustrated at the ruthless ousting as prime minister of their beloved former MP, Malcolm Turnbull. Scott Morrison has failed his first electoral test as PM and more trouble is brewing. The lightning and thunder that jolted Bondi Beach and other parts of Wentworth as the polls closed are a sign of a wild political ride that lies ahead. The Morrison government has lost its narrow parliamentary majority, but it should survive, for now at least, with the support of independent MPs. However, with an election due next May its longer-term prospects appear increasingly grim. Why was Jerusalem an election issue? Controversy was stoked during the by-election race by the prime minister's proposal that Australia could follow the US and move its embassy to Jerusalem. Mr Sharma is the former Australian ambassador to Israel and first proposed such a move. Around 13% of Wentworth's voters are Jewish, compared to less than 0.5% of the Australian population as a whole. Kerryn Phelps has said any decision on recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital must take into account trade, security and defence considerations.",Australia's governing coalition has lost its one-seat parliamentary majority after a by-election in Sydney.
"The interior minister had called for the dismissal of western Moscow police chief Maj Gen Andrei Puchkov and drug control boss Maj Gen Yury Devyatkin. Mr Golunov was released after lawyers said drugs had been planted on him. It also emerged that police photos of a drugs lab were not taken in his flat. Mr Golunov, 36, who had been working for the Latvia-based independent news website Meduza, alleged he had been beaten while in custody. He was later released under house arrest before being freed late on Tuesday, a day after three respected newspapers published the same front-page headline: ""I/We are Golunov."" Hundreds of people were arrested during a pro-Golunov rally in central Moscow on Wednesday, many of them bearing the same slogan as the newspapers. Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev announced the suspension of officers involved in the case on Tuesday, saying that the reporter's guilt ""had not been proven"". President Putin has avoided commenting on the case, although his spokesman said earlier in the week that the Kremlin had been keeping a close eye on it. Mr Putin will appear before the Russian public in the annual ""Direct Line"" phone-in on 20 June, when Russians are given the chance to speak to the president. Russian commentators have suggested the Kremlin is keen for the story to disappear before the event. Mr Golunov was stopped last week while on his way to meet another journalist in Moscow. Police officers said they found the drug mephedrone in his bag, and more drugs and weighing scales in a search of his home. The journalist's lawyers and press freedom activists said the drugs had been planted in order to silence the investigative journalist. Supporters immediately claimed that he was innocent and a victim of false drugs charges used against opposition figures and human rights activists by the Russian state.","Days after anti-corruption journalist Ivan Golunov was freed amid an outcry over a fabricated drugs case, Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired two high-ranking Moscow police officials."

"The claims stem from the inquiries into the death of Meredith Kercher in 2007. At her murder trial, Knox, 23, claimed police hit her on the head during her interrogation. The police denied this. Knox, who is currently appealing against her murder conviction, told an earlier hearing she never intended slander and was just defending herself. If the American - who was due to appear in court on Tuesday - is found guilty, any additional jail term would be added to her existing 26-year sentence. Parents on trial Raffaele Sollecito, Knox's former boyfriend, is also appealing against his conviction for Miss Kercher's murder. Both Sollecito and Knox are awaiting the outcome of an independent examination of the forensic evidence in the case, which they say will prove their innocence. Knox's parents are also due to stand trial separately in July for claiming their daughter was abused by police during the murder investigation. Curt Knox and Edda Mellas made their claims in an interview with the British newspaper, the Sunday Times. Meredith Kercher, who was 21 and came from Surrey, died in November 2007 in the house she shared with Knox in the Umbrian town of Perugia. Prosecutors said Miss Kercher died during a sex game which went wrong.

"By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent There is plenty of physical evidence but few clues as to the motive. Across the world, counter-terrorism and intelligence officers are scratching their heads, looking at possible suspects and whether such an attack could happen in their own cities. Rightly, they are wary of jumping to premature conclusions. When al-Qaeda bombed Madrid's train stations in 2004 the Spanish government wrongly blamed the Basque separatist movement Eta, and when the Norwegian neo-fascist gunman Anders Breivik murdered 77 people in Oslo, many immediately assumed it to be the work of jihadists. So what lines is the Boston investigation following and why? A home-grown US operator with a domestic agenda As of Wednesday, this is thought to be the most likely culprit. The FBI maintains a long list of potential threats emanating from US individuals or groups harbouring violent intentions towards the federal government, civil organisations, or society in general. The list includes white racial supremacists, fundamentalist Christian extremists, animal rights activists and anti-abortionists. So-called ""lone wolf"" operators - individuals not belonging to any known terrorist group - are far harder for the authorities to detect and track. It took them more than seven years to catch the man who planted a pipe bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and more than 17 years to catch the Unabomber in 1996. Yet a recent report found that one-third of all domestic terrorist attacks in the US since 1995 have been carried out by lone individuals. Like the London bombings of July 2005, the Boston bombings represent an intelligence failure, but US authorities say they had no warning. The attack appears to have come out of the blue and it is notable that it was aimed not at government but at the general public. This is still an active line of pursuit. The explosive devices used follow a model broadly similar to ones promoted by al-Qaeda in an online magazine in 2010 that encouraged jihadists to make their own bombs. But experts say it is a relatively basic model that predates al-Qaeda. The US has recently escaped a number of attempts by lone jihadists to carry out attacks in New York and elsewhere. Unlike the huge, centrally directed attacks of 9/11, solo operators need only be inspired, not trained, by the core leadership of al-Qaeda. America has long been their favoured target, but there are reasons to question whether this was the work of jihadists. There is no suicide element, the explosive used was relatively low power and, most importantly, there has been no claim of responsibility. The almost complete absence of any warnings, tip-offs or claims of responsibility are steering investigators away from this line for now. ""It doesn't feel like something directed from overseas"", said one counter-terrorism expert. Even the Pakistani Taliban, which has threatened attacks against mainland America, were quick to say they didn't do it. Bad as the body count was from Monday's attack - three dead and more than 170 injured - a pre-planned attack directed and funded from overseas would be looking to inflict a far higher death toll. All the recent terrorist plots intercepted in the UK and traced back to al-Qaeda in Pakistan have aimed to kill hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals. There has been some online celebration by jihadists hoping the bombings will turn out to be in al-Qaeda's name. But in Britain the Manchester-based Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim body dedicated to peaceful co-existence, has issued a statement reminding people that: ""Islam forbids terrorism, it is evil, and anyone carrying out such disgusting crimes does not do it in the name of Islam or Muslims."" This is considered the least likely avenue. North Korea and Iran are both sworn enemies of the US but neither country is thought likely to want to invite US retribution - and even further international isolation - by carrying out an attack like this. North Korea almost certainly lacks the capacity on the ground to carry it out, while many still doubt if Iran was really behind its alleged assassination attempt on the Saudi ambassador to Washington in 2011. So for now, the focus of the investigation remains domestic, with the priority being placed on forensic evidence from the scene, surveillance tapes, and witness statements. But if and when an international dimension is found then the net of investigation will be thrown far and wide, pulling in countries like Britain which has already offered its full support.","In the forensic laboratories at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, explosives experts are leading the investigation into how Monday's bombs in Boston were put together and who could be behind them."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the US-made jab about a week after approving a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which is now being distributed. The US has agreed to purchase 200 million doses of Moderna, and six million may be ready to ship now. The country has the world's highest numbers of Covid-19 deaths and cases. It has recorded more than 313,500 deaths and about 17.5 million infections, according to Johns Hopkins University. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the emergency approval of the vaccine on Friday marked ""another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day"". The authorisation came after an advisory panel on Thursday voted 20-0 with one abstention that the benefits of the Moderna vaccine outweighed the risks for those aged 18 and over. Regulators reported earlier this week that the Moderna vaccine was safe and 94% effective. US President Donald Trump, who hours before the official announcement tweeted that the vaccine had been ""overwhelmingly approved"" and distribution would ""start immediately"", said on Twitter: ""Congratulations, the Moderna vaccine is now available!"" President-elect Joe Biden, who is set to be vaccinated on Monday, said the authorisation of the Pfizer and the Moderna jabs ""assures us that brighter days lie ahead"". But, he added, ""the fight against Covid-19 is not yet over."" ""We know the immense challenges ahead, including scaling up manufacturing, distribution, and the monumental task of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans. We need to make sure we have the resources to do all of this and to do it quickly."" How does Moderna differ from the Pfizer vaccine? It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. The jab manufactured by US corporation Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech SE requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second injection comes 28 days after the first, compared with 21 for Pfizer. Moderna is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had previously said that the ""vast majority"" of its doses would be manufactured there. Pfizer/BioNTech is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium. Other countries have also ordered the Moderna vaccine: Who is first in line in the US? The US vaccination programme aims to reach 100 million people by April. New York nurse Sandra Lindsay was among the first people in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine when the Pfizer/BioNTech rollout began on Monday. Footage of her being vaccinated was streamed on the Twitter feed of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state was the epicentre of the US epidemic in the first wave earlier this year. ""I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a very painful time in our history. I want to instil public confidence that the vaccine is safe. We're in a pandemic and so we all need to do our part,"" Ms Lindsay said. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines submitted to US states say healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well Americans living in long-term care homes. Essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist of federal vaccine distribution programme Operation Warp Speed, says the young and healthy should be at the back of the queue. At least 70% or 80% of the US population need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, he said. In a statement on Friday, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said he hoped that ""all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them"". ""That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward,"" he said. Earlier, Vice-President Mike Pence received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine live on television, with the White House saying the aim was to ""promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people"".","Moderna has been approved by the US government as the country's second Covid-19 vaccine, clearing the way for millions of doses to be released."
"Now, the last two members of the group dubbed the ""Beatles"" by their hostages, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, have been arrested by Syrian Kurdish fighters. The group of four British men were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria, where they became infamous for their high-profile executions of Western hostages. US officials believe the ""execution cell"" beheaded more than 27 Western hostages and tortured many more. Each was known to their hostages by their respective Beatles moniker - Paul, Ringo, John and George. Spanish journalist and former hostage Javier Espinosa, told the BBC in 2017 that the group were ""thugs with no knowledge of what is religion at all"". But who were the IS ""Beatles""? Mohammed Emwazi, dubbed Jihadi John in the media, fronted a number of IS propaganda videos where Western hostages were shown executed. Born in Kuwait, his family moved to the UK when he was six years old in 1988. He was educated in north London, and graduated from the University of Westminster in 2009 in computer programming. While in the UK, he came under surveillance from UK intelligence services after travelling to Tanzania and Kuwait. He was linked with a number of high-profile suspected jihadists that MI5 were tracking. His family reported him missing in 2013. Throughout 2014 he appeared in number of videos, with his face disguised, where Western hostages including US journalist James Foley and UK aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning appeared to be beheaded. The last known video appearance from him was January 2015. A top target for intelligence services, he was killed in a US drone strike on 12 November that year. Read more on Emwazi Aine Davis was arrested near Istanbul in 2015, and convicted in Turkey in 2017 of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation. Back in London he had lived in Hammersmith. He had a number of drug convictions and was jailed in 2006 for possessing a firearm. After converting to Islam, he changed his name to Hamza and met Emwazi. The two were part of a group that radicalised Muslims living in London. He left the UK to join the IS in 2013. After being arrested he denied being part of the terror group, or ""the Beatles"" cell. Read more on Davis. Alexanda Kotey is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background, and attended the same al-Manaar mosque in west London as Emwazi. He was described by neighbours as ""quiet and humble"" and a dedicated fan of the Queens Park Rangers football team, the Buzzfeed news website reported. He was identified as one of the gang by the US state department, which said he was likely to have been a recruiter of UK nationals to the group. US officials have said that he and fourth member El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are targeting remnants of IS. Both Elsheikh and Kotey are designated as terrorists by the US state department, who link them to the group's executions and ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"" including electric shocks, waterboarding and mock executions. The son of Sudanese refugees, Elsheikh went to Syria in 2012 and joined al-Qaeda there before aligning himself with IS, the New York Times reports. The men were said to have been detained in mid-January after Kurdish fighters suspected they were foreign fighters. Their identities are reported to have been confirmed by the US using biometric testing including fingerprints. News of their arrest emerged initially in US media, before being confirmed by officials.

"More than 400 fieldfares and 200 redwings were recorded by the ornithology warden on the Calf of Man on the 15-16 October. Both species are members of the thrush family and travel from northern Europe in search of warmer weather and food.

Director of the Manx Wildlife Trust Duncan Bridges says it was a very exciting time for wildlife on the island. ""The arrival of these species really marks the beginning of the peak autumn migration. Over the next few weeks there will be so much to see around the island. ""The warden on the Calf of Man is recording a real influx of birds to our shores.

"The trial heard Winston Blackmore, 61, married 24 women. His former brother-in-law James Oler, 53, married five. They were both charged with one count of polygamy. Each face up to five years in prison. The landmark ruling is considered a test of the boundaries of religious freedom in Canada. ""The Charter of Rights is the supreme law of Canada but we have to realise that the rights in the Charter are not absolute,"" Wally Opal, former BC attorney general told CTV News following Monday's ruling. Blackmore and Oler are from Bountiful in southeastern BC, a religious community of about 1,500 people founded in 1946. Both are former bishops with a breakaway Mormon sect, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS). Mr Blackmore was excommunicated from the FLDS in 2002 and replaced by Mr Oler. The sect has branches in the United States, where it has about 10,000 members. Polygamy is illegal under Section 293 of Canada's Criminal Code. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police first began investigating the sect in Bountiful in the 1990s. But attempts to bring the case to trial stumbled over a lack of legal clarity. In 2011, the BC Supreme Court upheld Canada's anti-polygamy law as constitutional following a request from BC's government for a ruling on the issue. It said the law was a reasonable restriction on religious freedoms in Canada. The verdict on Monday is unlikely to be the final legal word. Blackmore's lawyer, Blair Suffredine, told the court he planned to launch a challenge to the anti-polygamy laws should his client be found guilty. Legal experts suggest that the case is likely to eventually end up in the Supreme Court of Canada.",Two Canadian religious leaders have been found guilty of practising polygamy by the Supreme Court of British Columbia (BC).
"Aftershocks have continued ever since, and on Saturday the US Geological Survey said it had detected two more, sparking significant debate about what might be going on underground. What happened during the nuclear test? On 3 September, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear bomb to date at its Punggye-ri test site in the mountains in its northwest. Pyongyang claimed it was a hydrogen bomb, which would have made it a device many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. Experts have expressed concerns the explosion might have been so powerful it could destabilise the surrounding mountains. Why are aftershocks still happening? According to the USGS, last weekend's tremors were ""relaxation events"". They measured a magnitude of 2.9 and 2.4. ""When you have a large nuclear test, it moves the earth's crust around the area, and it takes a while for it to fully subside. We've had a few of them since the sixth nuclear test,"" an official told Reuters. The ""movement of the earth's crust"" is akin to the very definition of an earthquake and scientists say it is only to be expected in the weeks and months after an explosion of that magnitude. ""These aftershocks for a 6.3 magnitude nuclear test are not very surprising,"" Dr Jascha Polet, seismologist and professor of geophysics at California State Polytechnic University, told the BBC. After any tremor of that size, aftershocks with declining magnitude are common, as the rock moves around and releases stress. The area around the quake site ""experiences deformation, and this creates areas of increased and decreased stress, which affects the distribution of aftershocks,"" Ms Polet said. ""The fact that the source of the earthquake is an explosion doesn't change how we expect the energy to redistribute,"" geophysicist and disaster researcher Mika McKinnon, told the BBC. But research on explosions of a similar magnitude as the North Korea nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site in the US where over decades nuclear tests were carried out, has found that the aftershocks of these events were fewer in number and lower in magnitude. So each location is unique. Can tremors destroy the test site? One of the speculations after the September test was that it would damage the tunnel system North Korea has dug into the mountains at its test site. ""The more energy you put into an area, the more unstable it's going to get,"" Mika McKinnon explained. ""The more tests are happening, the more energy there is, the more redistribution of stress and the more rocks will be breaking."" There have been some indications of individual tunnel collapses, she explained. ""Seismic signals that look more like rock fall than anything else. That will happen more and more."" But, she adds, there is no way of really knowing whether the entire tunnel system will collapse as this is an engineering problem far more than a scientific one. It is unclear whether this process already has rendered the current test site unusable but North Korea has hinted its next nuclear test could be above ground. Could the tremors cause a volcanic eruption? Near the Punggye-ri test site is the active volcano of Mount Paektu, a mountain considered holy in North Korea. ""The seismic waves are hitting the volcano and hitting the magma beneath the volcano,"" Ms McKinnon explained. But she says it is ""unlikely that any of this seismic energy would be sufficient to trigger an eruption"". The volcano last erupted in 1903, but the latest underground nuclear test sparked concern the tremors might trigger another eruption. This has been a point of debate, but there is little data to support this. A study published in Nature last year predicted that the seismic waves of a hypothetical nuclear test at magnitude 7.0 would produce ""stress changes"" that were not insignificant. But, as Ms Polet points out, ""little is known about what processes can and cannot trigger volcanic eruptions"" and there appears to be no documented correlation between the Nevada explosions and activity in nearby volcanic areas, such as Timber Mountain and Long Valley Caldera. There has also been no activity recorded as a result of nuclear tests conducted near the seismically active Aleutian Islands. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un still seems to trust the holy mountain. According to Reuters, official North Korean media have reported he scaled the volcano on Saturday together with several senior officials to ""emphasise his military vision"".",North Korea's nuclear test in September didn't just generate diplomatic shockwaves but also a 6.3 magnitude earthquake.
"The Washington DC street's name is a nod to the title of a book and film about the lives of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. They made significant contributions to space flight in the 1960s. But their successes and struggles were not widely known until decades later. ""'Hidden Figures' is about taking off our blinders and recognising the contributions of the unseen individuals who were there at the beginning of the story,"" Margot Lee Shetterly, who wrote the 2016 book which inspired the Oscar-nominated film, told the audience gathered in Washington. ""And whose persistence and whose courage delivered us to where we are today."" Ms Shetterly attended the unveiling of the street sign alongside members of each woman's family. Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who cosponsored a bill to rename the block, said he hoped the name would inspire future generations. ""When little girls and little boys come to see NASA, they're going to look up and see that sign,"" he said. ""This sign is a powerful testament that anyone who is telling a little girl or a little boy 'You can't do something', is not telling the truth."" Nasa began recruiting some college-educated African American women in the 1940s as ""human computers"", but they experienced both racial and gender discrimination at work. The renaming of the street comes ahead of 50th anniversary of the first moonwalk by NASA astronauts on 20 July. Nasa recently announced it would send Americans back to the moon by 2024, including the first woman to walk on its surface. Fewer than 11% of the 500-plus people who have travelled to space have been women, the space agency said.","The street outside Nasa's headquarters has been named ""Hidden Figures Way"", in honour of three African-American women whose work helped pave the way for future generations at the space agency."
"Paul Luxon's comment came after concerns were raised by deputies and parishes about a lack of information about its development. The Public Services Department said it would release more information soon. The States decided in February last year to increase recycling rates to 70% and export the remaining waste. This followed two previous decisions - in 2003 and 2010 - to cancel plans for waste-to-energy plants. It is estimated the island's only remaining landfill site at Mont Cuet will be full by 2022. Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Heidi Soulsby said she was reassured progress was being made. Contract concerns Meetings have been held by the department this week to bring deputies up to speed with progress on the strategy. Deputy Soulsby said she thought keeping those interested informed ""doesn't need a lot of time"". She said: ""Just a little bit [of information] can help keep things running smoothly."" She added she still had concerns about the length of time it would take to implement any changes to waste services. She said: ""I do understand it's a challenge. The States do not work at a lightning pace, and any legislation changes can take two years. ""They're getting there, but my concern will be when they are considering who does what - if kerbside recycling is contracted out, or they go to tender for composting or separation of waste work.""","All elements of Guernsey's waste strategy are due to be up and running by the end of 2015, the public services minister says."
"A gay couple popular in Poland, Jakub and Dawid, mime to George Michael songs, in a YouTube video promoted with the Twitter hashtag #Polandwakeup. George Michael, who died in December, was ""the greatest gay artist of our time"", the LGBT activists said. Poland's nationalist government, close to the Catholic Church, has been accused of restricting gay rights. Jakub and Dawid plan to get married in June - but same-sex unions are illegal in Poland, so they will go to Portugal for the ceremony. The campaigners said the video was aimed at an international audience, in the hope that ""it might force the government to make at least civil unions legal"". A European Parliament resolution in 2007 condemned homophobia in Europe, including ""the emerging climate of racist, xenophobic and homophobic intolerance in Poland"". It spoke of an anti-LGBT agenda in the Polish education system, and urged the Polish authorities to stop ""public leaders inciting discrimination and hatred based on sexual orientation"". Among the Polish gay celebrities backing the George Michael video project were: dancer and singer Wiktor Korszla, vloggers Piotr Sokolowski and Pawel Dworak, hairdresser Tomasz Bozek, campaigners Marek and Jedrzej Idziak-Sepkowski and drag queens Charlotte Drag Queer and Aldona Relax.",Gay celebrities in Poland have turned to the late singer George Michael in a campaign against Polish homophobia.
"Mostafa Pourmohammadi said he thought the number of capital crimes should be revised, the Tasnim News Agency said. ""In fact we want to find the most effective kind of punishment so that we are able to consider replacing execution,"" Mr Pourmohammadi said. The minister said the death penalty should be kept for ""corrupt people"". Fears over Iran woman's execution Journalist sues Iran over 'torture' 'Disturbing rise' in global executions ""Of course, maintaining execution as a punishment is still on the agenda, but not in the numbers implemented today,"" Mr Pourmohammadi said. ""The punishment of execution cannot be rejected, as there are some corrupt people in the country and there is no way for them but execution,"" he added. However, the minister observed that executions seemed to have had no deterrent effect over the past years. Iran executed at least 977 people in 2015 - the vast majority for drug-related crimes - compared with 743 the year before, according to Amnesty International. BBC Persian sources said that executing people for drug offences has recently sparked a debate in Iran. Users caught with small amounts of drugs intended for personal use are being sentenced to death, which some believe is excessive. Iran's justice system is based on Sharia law, which does not make capital punishment obligatory for drug crimes. Amnesty figures released in April stated that Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are responsible for 89% of the world's judicial executions. However, this does not take account of China, where thousands are believed to be killed and the records kept secret.","Iran's justice minister is looking for an ""effective punishment"" for criminals instead of execution, according to local media."
"Citgo Petroleum, a US-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, is named in papers filed with the Federal Election Commission. The revelation comes as the Venezuelan economy appears to be crippled by food shortages, violent crime and inflation. Three people were killed in protests on Wednesday as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand new elections Other major corporations named in the documents include Pepsi and Walmart, which gave $250,000 and $150,000 respectively, while owners of NFL teams or their companies gave more than $5m. Casino owner and billionaire Sheldon Adelson also gave $5m. Business as usual - Analysis by Luis Fajardo, BBC Mundo Venezuela is in the middle of a major economic crisis, which has the oil-rich country flirting with hyperinflation. This Wednesday, street protests demanding the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro resulted in at least two persons shot dead. In this chaotic context, it is perhaps less surprising that Venezuelan media did not seem to dedicate much time to cover the news that their government gave, through a state-owned oil company, a US$500,000 contribution to Donald Trump's inauguration. Still, some analysts in Venezuela are expressing anger at the news. ""We have been experiencing four consecutive years of recession, we have the highest inflation in the world and are facing scarcity in many basic goods. It is scandalous that Venezuela, facing such a crisis, would make those donations to the inauguration of a US president, who at least in theory, is ideologically confronted with the revolution,"" Jose Manuel Puente, a professor of public policy at IESA university in Caracas, tells the BBC. The payment was reportedly made through Citgo, a US subsidiary of Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA. It is not the first time Citgo has been involved in politically controversial activities in the US. President Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, used the company a few years ago to provide subsidised fuel to low-income citizens in several major US cities. His critics said then it was a propaganda ploy designed to annoy his ideological rivals at the White House. But now the Maduro administration would seem to be in a less confrontational mode towards Washington. The Venezuelan president has recently been quoted saying that Trump has been the target of a ""brutal hate campaign"" and added that he ""won't be worse than Obama"". ""The (Bolivarian) revolution is pragmatic,"" Puente tells the BBC. ""Eighteen years after the beginning of the revolution, the US is still their main trading partner. It is business as usual"".","Venezuela has donated $500,000 to US President Donald Trump's inauguration, newly released records show."
"Rangers discovered the remains of two, possibly three, people in a lion enclosure in the Sibuya reserve, near the south-east town of Kenton-on-Sea. A high-powered rifle and an axe were also found. There has been a rise in poaching in Africa in recent years, to feed growing demand for rhino horn in parts of Asia. In China, Vietnam and elsewhere, rhino horn is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties, even though it is made from the same material as human fingernails. Sibuya reserve owner Nick Fox said in a statement on the reserve's Facebook page that the suspected poachers entered the reserve late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning. ""They strayed into a pride of lions - it's a big pride so they didn't have too much time,"" Mr Fox told AFP news agency. ""We're not sure how many there were - there's not much left of them."" The remains were first spotted at 16:30 local time on Tuesday (14:30 GMT). An anti-poaching team arrived on the scene, where a hunting rifle with silencer, a long axe and wire-cutters - equipment generally used by rhino poachers - were also found. Several lions had to be tranquilised before the remains could be recovered, Mr Fox added. Police have been patrolling the area in case any of the suspected poachers survived. Nine rhinos were killed by poachers in Eastern Cape province, where the reserve is located, this year alone. More than 7,000 have been killed in South Africa in the past decade.","At least two suspected rhino poachers have been mauled to death and eaten by lions on a South African game reserve, officials say."
"In the run up to Canada Day, we asked BBC readers to tell us what they thought were some of the biggest contributions the country has made to the world. Here are some of those suggestions. 1. Entertainment The list of Canadian singers, actors, comedians and entertainers is extensive. Readers flagged artists Shania Twain, Celine Dion, Drake, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Arcade Fire, Alanis Morissette and Justin Bieber as just a handful of the musicians who have achieved global fame and swept awards shows for their work. Many BBC readers are apparent fans of Canadian rock band Rush. ""For the arts, Canada produced no finer contribution than Rush, true artists whose eloquence, inventiveness and commitment to musicianship earned them generations of fiercely loyal fans, and inspired generations of musicians,"" Bill Mamer wrote from Chicago. Canadians also got a nod for bringing the laughs. ""Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Dan Aykroyd, Martin Short... shall I go on?"" asked Donald Samulack, from Furlong, Pennsylvania. The Naked Gun's Leslie Nielsen, who was born in Saskatchewan, and Back to the Future's Michael J Fox, from Alberta, also both notched up a number of mentions. Maxime Tremblay pointed to Montreal's Cirque du Soleil as an unchallenged world leader in circus arts, with employees on five continents. ""French Canadian directors also continue their take over of the world in the cinema industry,"" Tremblay said, citing Dallas Buyer's Club director Jean-Marc Vallée and Arrival director Denis Villeneuve. Quebec, along with Toronto and Vancouver, is also a video game hub. The province is the world's fifth-largest video game centre and its companies have generated blockbusters like the Assassin's Creed series. 2. Inventions From Imax to Instant replay and instant mashed potatoes, Canadians are the brains behind a mixed bag of innovations - from the handy to the transformative. John Langan, from Havana, Florida, said no list would be complete without mention of James Gosling's work. The Calgary-born computer scientist is the creator of the Java programming language - ""currently the most important language in the world"", says Langan. A gift to parents everywhere, Olivia Poole, an American-Canadian mother of seven children herself, patented the bouncing baby exerciser known as the Jolly Jumper in 1954. Some Canadian innovations fly under the radar, barely noticed because they are so common. ""Two great everyday items used by everyone from builders to DIYers are the caulk gun and the Robertson pattern screw head,"" says David Barrett, from Fernie, British Columbia. They were invented by Theodore Witt and Peter Lymburner Robertson, respectively. In a similar vein Robert Walton, from Thorold, Ontario, flagged the paint roller as ""a globally used tool"". A first basic version of the device was created by Torontonian Norman Breakey in the 1940s. Ottawa's Laura Mei sent in a long list of Canadian innovations, which included Harry Wasylyk, Larry Hanson and Frank Plomp's invention in the 1950s of the polyethylene plastic bag- otherwise known as the garbage bag. 3. Medical breakthroughs Insulin was by far the most mentioned Canadian contribution by BBC readers, and for good reason. Sir Frederick Grant Banting, born in Ontario in 1891, co-discovered the lifesaving therapy for diabetes in 1921 and went on to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine the following year. The discovery of the hormone and its use in treating diabetes has saved millions of lives over the nearly 100 years since Banting and his colleagues' groundbreaking work. Canadians James Till and Ernest McCulloch were the first to identify a stem cell. In 1961, the pair discovered transplantable stem cells at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto. Stem cells have tremendous potential in the medical field when it comes to the treatment of illnesses like Alzheimer's, macular degeneration, heart disease and stroke. ""This has to be the most significant medical discovery of our age, yet outside of the scientific community it goes unrecognised and unheralded,"" says David Halton, from Ottawa. 4. Space exploration On Canada Day, the Canadian Space Agency announced its two latest hires, newly minted astronauts Joshua Kutryk and Jennifer Sidey. They are the latest in a list of well known Canadian spacemen and women, including Chris Hadfield, who charmed people worldwide with his rendition of David Bowie's Space Oddity from orbit while on the International Space Station (ISS). Canada has also contributed much to space research and robotics. ""Our contribution to space exploration is huge. We designed and built the Canadarm which is one of the most important pieces in the space station,"" wrote Toronto's Richard Mootoo. The Canadarm2 is a robotic arm that assembled the ISS in space. The robotic arm is currently used to move supplies, equipment and even astronauts. It is the successor of the original Canadarm, which was used for three decades with Nasa's space shuttle programme.","Canada is a country with a relatively small population of just about 36 million people, but its citizens have still been busy inventing, innovating and entertaining."
"By Bethany BellBBC News, Greece Migrant numbers are rising, and conditions at the overcrowded camps on the islands are dismal. At Moria, the largest camp on the island of Lesbos, there are more than 19,000 asylum seekers living at a facility with a capacity for 2,840. Banners on the Lesbos municipal theatre proclaimed: ""We want our islands back"". Another read: ""No more prisons for human souls in the North Aegean."" North Aegean Regional Governor Kostas Moutzouris said on Wednesday he was ""annoyed"" that Greek islands had been ""turned into places of concentration and detention"" for thousands of people around the world. By midday (10:00 GMT) about 3,000 protesters had gathered in Mytilene, Lesbos's capital, while another 1,500 demonstrators were in the centre of Samos town. Shops, pharmacies and petrol stations closed, and some clinics and lawyers' offices were also due to shut. Taxi and bus drivers were also joining the strike. Many locals here feel abandoned. On the island of Samos, Giorgos, a bartender who works in the tourist trade, told the BBC he was angry with the government. ""Here it's like a prison,"" he said. ""The migrants aren't allowed to leave the island. They aren't free to go where they like."" Migration and Asylum Minister Notis Mitarakis, who visited Samos and Lesbos at the weekend, highlighted two ways to curb migration to the islands: ""First, more efficient guarding of our borders and, second, the immediate return of those who don't deserve international protection,"" he said. In Samos town, the refugee camp is in the olive groves on a hill just a few minutes' walk from the town centre. It is common to see migrants hanging around on benches at the seafront. ""In Samos town there are more of them than us,"" Giorgos said. ""They are different. They change our culture."" He is worried that this has a negative effect on tourism. ""Samos town was full of tourists before. Many people I know, from England too, they say they won't come to the town."" Greece's Ministry for Citizen Protection says there are currently around 7,200 migrants living in the camp on Samos, which was designed for just 700. The local population of Samos town is around 6,500. Feelings are running high. In December, the mayor of East Samos, Giorgos Stantzos, was caught on video shouting and swearing as he chased migrants away from the town's main square. The mayor was accused of racism. He says he was trying to stop some migrants from disrupting a Christmas event. Mr Stantzos is a diver and volunteer rescue worker, who helped pull asylum seekers from the sea, but these days he is pushing for migrants to leave Samos. ""I saved people in the past and if necessary, I would do it again now,"" he told me. ""When human lives are in danger, we have to protect them."" ""But we want the refugees and the immigrants to go to another place, to Greece or other parts of the EU,"" he told me. ""More people are coming and just staying on our islands. They live in tents in inhuman conditions."" He said it would be ""a nightmare"" if that continued. None of the migrants I spoke to were happy with the conditions at the camp in Samos. Hisham, from Gaza, says it is a ""sick environment"", adding: ""It's a very bad situation. I am here three months and nothing has happened with me. I hope to leave this island as soon as I can."" Martha, from Ghana, said she was first given a bed in a container where she was the only woman. ""I've moved to a tent and it is very cold."" She says Greek people move away when they see her in the street. ""They don't want the refugees here. It's not good,"" she said. ""I want to move from Samos. I don't like Samos at all. I want to go to the city. Maybe there it will be different.""

"Three Ukrainian troops died earlier when a mine blew up, the military said. The US Department of State called it ""the deadliest one-day period in 2017"" in the eastern Ukraine conflict. In a video tweet on Thursday, the state department blamed the ""Russian-led"" rebels for the flare-up and urged both sides to observe the fragile ceasefire. The rebels also reported clashes on Thursday but did not confirm the Ukrainian death toll. The UN says more than 10,000 people have died since the eastern Ukraine conflict erupted in April 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. The fighting has displaced more than 1.6 million people. A ceasefire was agreed in Minsk in February 2015, but its terms are far from being fulfilled. A Ukrainian military statement on Facebook said the pro-Russian rebels fired mortars, grenades and machine guns in the Avdiivka area, and Ukrainian troops returned fire. It was the most intense fighting since 11 June when four Ukrainian soldiers were killed. Western governments accuse Russia of helping the rebels with regular troops and heavy weapons. Moscow denies that, while admitting that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. On Tuesday the Donetsk rebel chief, Alexander Zakharchenko, announced plans to create a new ""state"" to replace Ukraine. He called it ""Malorossiya"" (Little Russia) - but the Kremlin later dismissed it as just his ""personal initiative"".",The Ukrainian military says five of its soldiers died in heavy rebel shelling of Ukrainian army positions at Avdiivka just north of rebel-held Donetsk.
"They were removed using an emergency law that came into force earlier this month following July's failed coup. The mayors are being replaced by trustees appointed by the government. Tens of thousands of people have been purged from government jobs since the coup, accused of links to terrorist organisations. Some 200 people were dispersed by tear gas and water cannon after gathering outside the city hall in Suruc, the private Dogan news agency reports. Four people, including a deputy mayor, were detained after a skirmish in Hakkari province, Dogan said. Some Turkish media reports said that the internet and electricity had been cut off in the affected cities. Who are the PKK? Who are the Kurds? Who did Turkey purge after the coup? Turkey's Anadolu Agency said that, 24 of the removed mayors are suspected of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Another four are thought to be linked to Fethullah Gulen, the US-based cleric accused by the government of being behind the coup attempt. ""Mayors and town councillors, who come to power through elections, must perform their duties according to the law,"" Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag wrote on Twitter. ""If [they] finance terrorism by transferring public funds allocated to them to serve the people, and allow the use of municipal vehicles, equipment and capabilities in terrorist activities, they lose their democratic legitimacy."" The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), whose mayors were principally affected, condemned the move as ""coup by trustees"". ""This unlawful and arbitrary action will only deepen the existing problems in Kurdish towns and cause the Kurdish issue to be even more unsolvable."" Tens of thousands of people have died in a decades-long insurgency by the PKK, who want more self-rule for Kurdish people. Meanwhile, the Turkish Nobel-winning writer Orhan Pamuk has said Turkey is becoming a ""regime of terror"". He was writing in Italy's La Repubblica newspaper in response to the arrest on Saturday of leading journalist Ahmet Altan and his brother Mehmet, a renowned economist. ""In Turkey, we are progressively putting behind bars all people who take the liberty of voicing even the slightest criticism of the government,"" he wrote. He said the crackdown was being driven by ""the most ferocious hatred"". ""Freedom of thought no longer exists. We are distancing ourselves at high speed from a state of law and heading towards a regime of terror.""",Clashes have broken out in parts of south-eastern Turkey after 28 elected mayors in largely Kurdish towns were removed from office.
"The UN watchdog for children's rights denounced the Holy See for adopting policies which allowed priests to sexually abuse thousands of children. In a report, it also criticised Vatican attitudes towards homosexuality, contraception and abortion. The Vatican responded by saying it would examine the report - but also accused its authors of interference. A group representing the victims of abuse by priests in the US welcomed the report. In its findings, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) said the Holy See should open its files on members of the clergy who had ""concealed their crimes"" so that they could be held accountable by the authorities. It said it was gravely concerned that the Holy See had not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, and expressed its ""deepest concern about child sexual abuse committed by members of the Catholic churches who operate under the authority of the Holy See, with clerics having been involved in the sexual abuse of tens of thousands of children worldwide"". It also lambasted the ""practice of offenders' mobility"", referring to the transfer of child abusers from parish to parish within countries, and sometimes abroad. The committee said this practice placed ""children in many countries at high risk of sexual abuse, as dozens of child sexual offenders are reported to be still in contact with children"". The UN report called on a Vatican commission created by Pope Francis in December to investigate all cases of child sexual abuse ""as well as the conduct of the Catholic hierarchy in dealing with them"". Ireland's Magdalene laundries scandal was singled out by the report as an example of how the Vatican had failed to provide justice despite ""slavery-like"" conditions, including degrading treatment, violence and sexual abuse. The laundries were Catholic-run workhouses where some 10,000 women and girls were required to do unpaid manual labour between 1922 and 1996. The report's findings come after Vatican officials were questioned in public last month in Geneva about why they would not release data and what they were doing to prevent future abuse. The Vatican has denied any official cover-up. However, in December it refused a UN request for data on abuse on the grounds that it only released such information if requested to do so by another country as part of legal proceedings. In January, the Vatican confirmed that almost 400 priests had been defrocked in a two-year period by the former Pope Benedict XVI over claims of child abuse. The UN committee's recommendations are non-binding and there is no enforcement mechanism. 'Non-negotiable' The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the Vatican has set up new guidelines to protect children from predatory priests. But, he adds, bishops in many parts of the world have tended to concentrate on protecting and defending the reputation of priests rather than listening to the complaints of victims of paedophile priests. Meanwhile several Catholic dioceses in the US have been forced into bankruptcy after paying out huge sums in compensation to victims of abuse by clergy. The Vatican said in a statement following the report's publication: ""The Holy See takes note of the concluding observations...which will be submitted to a thorough study and examination... according to international law and practice."" But it added that it ""regrets to see in some points of the concluding observations an attempt to interfere with Catholic Church teaching on the dignity of human person and in the exercise of religious freedom"" and ""reiterates its commitment to defending and protecting the rights of the child... according to the moral and religious values offered by Catholic doctrine"". Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, head of the Holy See's delegation to the United Nations in Geneva, told Vatican Radio the report had failed to take into account the fact that the Vatican had made ""a series of changes for the protection of children"", and its efforts at reform were ""fact, evidence, which cannot be distorted"". He added that the UN could not ask the Church to change its ""non-negotiable"" moral teachings. Victims groups welcomed the report as a wake-up call to secular law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute Church officials who were still protecting ""predator priests"". Barbara Blaine, president of a group representing US victims of abuse by priests - Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) - told the BBC that the UN report ""reaffirms everything we've been saying. It shows that the Vatican has put the reputation of Church officials above protection of children"". ""Church officials knew about it and they refused to stop it. Nothing has changed. Despite all the rhetoric from Pope Francis and Vatican officials, they refuse to take action that will make this stop.""","The UN has said that the Vatican should ""immediately remove"" all clergy who are known or suspected child abusers."
"The 7.8 magnitude quake struck an area between the capital, Kathmandu, and the city of Pokhara, the US Geological Survey said. Tremors were felt across the region, with further loss of life in India, Bangladesh, Tibet and on Mount Everest. The government has declared a state of emergency in the affected areas. A national police spokesman told the BBC that 970 people had died in the quake, and that more than 1,700 had been injured. At least 539 people were killed in the Kathmandu valley, he added. Nepali Information Minister Minendra Rijal said there had been ""massive damage"" at the epicentre, from where little information is emerging. Get the latest updates on the Nepalese earthquake ""We need support from the various international agencies which are more knowledgeable and equipped to handle the kind of emergency we face now,"" he said. The US is sending a disaster response team to Nepal and has released an initial $1m (£0.7m) to address immediate needs, the US aid agency USAid has said. Rescuers are digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings in the capital trying to reach survivors, as thousands prepare to spend the night outside as darkness fell. A number of historic buildings have been destroyed. Among those wrecked was the landmark Dharahara tower, with many feared trapped in its ruins. After the earthquake struck, frightened residents came out into the streets. Mobile phones and other communications have been disrupted. Analysis: Navin Singh Khadka, BBC News Major historic monuments in the Nepalese capital have been destroyed in the powerful earthquake, eyewitnesses and officials have said. These include a nine-storey tower, temples and some parts of what was once a royal palace, all listed as Unesco world heritage sites. Pictures posted on social media show some of the monuments have been reduced to rubble. Eyewitnesses say several others now have cracks and could collapse. Officials have said some temples and monuments at other world heritage sites near Kathmandu have also been damaged. These sites are Nepal's major tourist attractions. Nepal had lost several such monuments during a major earthquake in 1934. Quake levels Nepal landmarks There are also reports of damage to Kathmandu airport which could hamper relief operations. With little known about the extent of the damage around the earthquake's epicentre, there are fears the death toll could rise. Aftershocks continued to ripple through the region hours later. The quake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least eight people, and another five in Tibet, officials and reports say. ""Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain,"" tweeted mountaineer Alex Gavan.

"The Sakharov prize was awarded to 10 members of the country's opposition for ""their courage, resilience and determination"" during recent unrest. Belarus has seen mass protests since August's disputed presidential vote, amid claims of poll-rigging. ""We are bound to win - and we will win,"" she said during the ceremony. Long-term President Alexander Lukashenko has refused to concede the election and authorities in the former Soviet republic have been accused of brutality during the demonstrations that followed. The Sakharov prize, which recognises human rights activists and dissidents around the world, is awarded annually in memory of Soviet scientist and dissident Andrei Sakharov. Previous winners include a Uighur academic jailed by China (2019) and two Yazidi women who escaped sexual enslavement by the Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq (2016). The prize was given to Belarus's opposition Co-ordination Council, which the European Parliament described as ""an initiative of brave women, as well as prominent political and civil society figures"". A number of the winners are currently in prison. ""They have stood and still stay strong in the face of a much stronger adversary. But they have on their side something that brute force can never defeat - and this is the truth,"" the parliament's president, David Sassoli, said while announcing the winners in October. Accepting the award in Brussels on Wednesday, Ms Tikhanovskaya noted Belarusians had overcome ""an invisible wall of fear"" during the 2020 protests. ""We feel humbled that our story of resistance touched so many people around the globe,"" she said, while also urging countries in the EU and elsewhere to offer greater support to protesters. ""We call on Europe to be braver in their decision and to support the people of Belarus now - not tomorrow and not in the future. Your solidarity is important, but actions matter,"" she said. Ms Tikhanovskaya was forced to leave Belarus after President Alexander Lukashenko, who has led the country since 1994, was declared the winner of the 9 August election. The European Union has imposed sanctions on dozens of officials in Belarus in recent months.","Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has said she is ""humbled"" after accepting the European Parliament's top human rights prize."
"By Reality Check teamBBC News It's widely believed to have been prompted by concerns over China's economic ambitions in Europe. It will allow the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - to give an opinion when an investment ""threatens the security or public order"" of more than one member state or undermines an EU-wide project such as the Galileo satellite project. In March, the European Commission called China a ""systemic rival"" and a ""strategic competitor"". The Chinese Ambassador to the EU urged the bloc to remain ""open and welcome"" to Chinese investment, and not to ""discriminate"". How much foreign investment is in the EU? China's ownership of EU businesses is relatively small, but has grown quickly over the past decade. A third of the bloc's total assets are now in the hands of foreign-owned, non-EU companies, according to a report from the European Commission in March. Of these, 9.5% of companies had their ownership based in China, Hong Kong or Macau - up from 2.5% in 2007. That compares with 29% controlled by US and Canadian interests by the end of 2016 - down from nearly 42% in 2007. So, it's a significant increase, but the total amount is not huge, comparatively speaking. The amount of Chinese foreign direct investment in the EU has been rising rapidly, peaking at €37.2bn in 2016. However, it's fallen away since then amidst a slowdown in Chinese investment globally, according to the Rhodium Group and the Mercator Institute for China Studies. In European countries outside the EU, Chinese investment also dropped in 2018. What and where is China investing? A large proportion of Chinese direct investment, both state and private, is concentrated in the major economies, such as the UK, France and Germany combined, according to the Rhodium Group and Mercator Institute. Analysis by Bloomberg last year said that China now owned, or had a stake in, four airports, six maritime ports and 13 professional soccer teams in Europe. It estimated there had been 45% more investment activity in 30 European countries from China than from the US, since 2008. And it said this was underestimating the true extent of Chinese activity. What about infrastructure? In March, Italy was the first major European economy to sign up to China's new Silk Road programme - known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It involves huge infrastructure building to increase trade between China and markets in Asia and Europe. Officially more than 20 countries in Europe (including Russia) are part of the initiative. For example, China is financing the expansion of the port of Piraeus in Greece and is building roads and railways in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and North Macedonia. This could prove attractive to poorer Balkan and southern European countries, especially as demands for transparency and good governance can make EU funding appear less attractive. However, analysts point out that Chinese loans come with conditions - such as the involvement of Chinese companies - and also risk burdening these countries with large amounts of debt. Will Chinese investment grow? Globally, China's outward direct investment has slowed over the last year or two, after more than a decade of expansion. ""This is mainly the result of stricter controls on capital outflows from China, but also of a changing political environment globally concerning Chinese investment,"" says Agatha Kratz of the Rhodium Group. The US administration is taking a tougher line towards China's economic activities. Governments elsewhere are more cautious - particularly when it comes to investment in sensitive areas of the economy, such as telecommunications and defence. But there's little doubt China is now a significant player in Europe, whether through direct investments or via the new Silk Road project. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"A herdsman is stable in hospital after being confirmed with the disease at the weekend. A WHO spokeswoman said the case was being ""well managed"". The bubonic plague was once the world's most feared disease, but can now be easily treated. What has the WHO said? Spokeswoman Margaret Harris said: ""Bubonic plague has been with us and is always with us, for centuries. We are looking at the case numbers in China. It's being well managed. ""At the moment, we are not considering it high risk but we're watching it, monitoring it carefully."" The WHO said it was informed on Monday of the case of the herdsman, who is being treated at a hospital in Bayannur. Chinese news agency Xinhua says Mongolia had also confirmed two cases last week - brothers who had eaten marmot meat in Khovd province. Russian officials are warning communities in the country's Altai region not to hunt marmots, as infected meat from the rodents is a known transmission route. What is bubonic plague? Bubonic plague, caused by bacterial infection, was responsible for one of the deadliest epidemics in human history - the Black Death - which killed about 50 million people across Africa, Asia and Europe in the 14th Century. There have been a handful of large outbreaks since. It killed about a fifth of London's population during the Great Plague of 1665, while more than 12 million died in outbreaks during the 19th Century in China and India. But nowadays it can be treated by antibiotics. Left untreated, the disease - which is typically transmitted from animals to humans by fleas - has a 30-60% fatality rate. Symptoms of the plague include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin. Could there be another epidemic? Bubonic cases are rare, but there are still a few flare-ups of the disease from time to time. Madagascar saw more than 300 cases during an outbreak in 2017. However, a study in medical journal The Lancet found fewer than 30 people died. In May last year, two people in Mongolia died after eating the raw meat of a marmot. However, it's unlikely any cases will lead to an epidemic. ""Unlike in the 14th Century, we now have an understanding of how this disease is transmitted,"" Dr Shanti Kappagoda, an infectious diseases doctor at Stanford Health Care, told news site Heathline. ""We know how to prevent it.""","The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is ""carefully monitoring"" a case of bubonic plague in China's northern Inner Mongolia region, but says that it is ""not high risk""."
"By Paul WoodBBC Middle East correspondent Relatives say they have evidence that she was murdered as part of a policy of deliberately killing journalists. The wrongful death lawsuit was filed at a district court in Washington DC. Colvin was reporting from the rebel-held area of Baba Amr, in Homs, in February 2012, when she was killed by government artillery. Shortly before, she did live broadcasts for the BBC, Channel Four and CNN. ""I watched a little baby die today,"" she said, talking over pictures of a child who had been hit by a sniper bullet. ""That is happening over and over and over."" Colvin, the celebrated correspondent for the Sunday Times in London, told the BBC that President Assad's forces were ""shelling with impunity, with merciless disregard for civilians"". She told CNN it was ""a complete and utter lie that they're only going after terrorists… The Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians"". Marie Colvin's last despatch from Homs 'Intercepted transmissions' The Colvin family believes that the satellite phone used in these broadcasts was traced by Syrian intelligence and used to locate the Baba Amr media centre, where she was based. According to documents obtained by their lawyers, a government informant then confirmed the location. An attack on the journalists was ordered that night, the lawsuit says. ""The transmissions were intercepted, and they were tracked to their GPS co-ordinates,"" said one of the legal team, Scott Gilmore. ""On top of that there was a whole web of informants who were already out searching for the journalists. Any journalist in Homs… could have been a target"". Marie's photographer, Paul Conroy, had told the BBC shortly after the attack that the incoming rounds were ""bracketed"" on the media centre, meaning they were being deliberately targeted. Conroy had served in an artillery regiment in the British Army. ""As an artilleryman, I think that was a good day's work for a for a well-trained team. Nothing smacked of randomness in that situation,"" he said. Now the family's lawyers say they have witnesses and documents smuggled out of Syria to prove this. 'We know killers' The lawsuit is the fruit of four years of research by the US-based Center for Justice and Accountability. The documents are said to show that the artillery strike was approved or ordered by President Assad's brother Maher, commander of the Republican Guards. The policy of targeting journalists is alleged to have been made by senior officials in the Central Crisis Management Cell, President Assad's war cabinet. ""I'm really proud to be able to bring this lawsuit,"" said Marie Colvin's sister, Cat. ""We know who Marie's killers are now; we want them brought to justice. I want them to be held accountable."" She went on: ""I'm very sensitive to the suffering of the Syrian people. I know I'm not the only one who's lost a sister and my mom is not the only one who is mourning the loss of a daughter. ""I'm in a unique position to be able to use the court to be able be bring Marie's killers to justice. I want to give a voice to the Syrian people. I want them to know we haven't forgotten them."" At the scene - Baba Amr media centre before the attack that killed Marie Colvin The shelling in Baba Amr was the most intense any of us in the BBC team had ever seen. The Syrians there were all wondering if this would be another Hama - the town destroyed by the old President Assad's artillery in 1982. Some 10,000-20,000 people were killed - there is still no accurate estimate - but not a single image was published of the carnage. In the age of the cameraphone and YouTube, that was not going to happen in Baba Amr. But - we believed - the regime still feared what effect the presence of international journalists would have. ""We could destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes, if there were no cameras,"" a regime official is supposed to have said, according to documents and witness statements obtained by the Colvin family's lawyers. The lawsuit says Marie was deliberately murdered according to orders given by some of the most senior officials in the Syrian regime. One of those who helped carry out the attack is said to have been rewarded by the Assad family with the gift of a car. These are allegations, yet to be tested in court. But the murder of journalists is just one war crime among many of which the regime stands accused. The Colvin family hopes the lawsuit will be a reminder of that - as some in the international community seek to rehabilitate President Assad.","The family of Marie Colvin, the American journalist who died in Syria four years ago, is suing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad."
"Kevin Delaney said Chief Pleas needed to do more to stimulate the economy. Conseiller Charles Maitland, from the Chief Pleas, said Sark was just coming out of a three-year building boom. He said: ""We are getting back to a more traditional situation, you can't abolish the downturn that happens every winter."" There are about 600 people living on Sark. Over the past year one of the largest employers, Sark Estate Management, went from employing about 140 people to just 30. Customs post Mr Delaney said: ""We are going through a process of losing 40 jobs on the island, that is 40 on top of 70 we lost at the end of 2012 season. ""Where we find ourselves now is from a company that could have provided 140 year round jobs for people across a diverse number of industries, we now go down to 30 jobs."" Mr Delaney said the company had to operate like a normal business and needed to make money. He said: ""It would be immoral to keep a large workforce and pay them with nothing to do."" He claimed the Chief Pleas could do more to stimulate the economy by introducing a customs post to attract visitors from France year round. ""The French coast there is extraordinary tidal, I can't imagine people coming in the winter at all,"" he said. ""Our temporary chief secretary is working on an economic strategy for Sark and we are working on a strategy that has yet to be approved by Chief Pleas.""","More needs to be done to provide year round jobs in Sark, according to the managing director of Sark Estate Management."
"Scores of blazes burned across the state and neighbouring Queensland on Tuesday as temperatures climbed as high as 40C (104F) in some areas. Authorities said one man had suffered serious burns in a fire that was thought to have been deliberately lit. Drought-affected parts of eastern Australia have endured intense fires since September - the start of spring. Authorities have described it as the worst start to the fire season on record in some areas. Bushfires were presently affecting more than 100,000 hectares of land. In some areas, the blazes had raged for more than five weeks. Dozens of houses were razed or damaged in the rural town of Rappville and surrounding areas on Tuesday. Authorities said they were investigating it as a possible case of arson. A home in Laidley, Queensland, was destroyed in a separate fire. One Rappville resident, Danny Smith, told reporters on Wednesday: ""I've lost the bloody sheds, the house, lost everything."" Another man was flown to hospital after suffering serious burns while trying to protect his home, authorities said. ""For a little while there, we even hit catastrophic fire conditions and now we've dropped back into the extreme conditions,"" said Queensland deputy fire commissioner John Bolger. The bushfires follow record high winter temperatures and sparse rainfall. Prior to that, Australia had its hottest summer on record. Many areas of south-east Australia are enduring a prolonged and severe drought, which scientists say is being exacerbated by climate change.",Up to 30 houses have been destroyed or seriously damaged in a bushfire in the Australian state of New South Wales.
"Hadiya Jahan, who is in her 20s, was born into a Hindu family, but converted to Islam and married a Muslim man. Her family alleged she was brainwashed as part of an anti-Hindu conspiracy, prompting a lower court to annul the marriage. India's top court has now set aside the ruling, restoring their marriage. Marriages between Hindus and Muslims have long attracted censure in conservative Indian families, but the attachment of a deeper, sinister motive to them is a recent phenomenon. Radical Hindu fringe groups have started describing some interfaith marriages as ""love jihad"" - a term they use to accuse Muslim men of participating in a ""conspiracy to turn Hindu women from their religion by seducing them"". Hadiya Jahan, earlier known by her Hindu name Akhila Asokan, has always insisted that she acted out of her own free will. Ms Jahan and her husband appealed after the high court in the state of Kerala annulled their marriage. The Supreme Court ordered an independent investigation. She was summoned to testify by the top court on whether she had been forced to convert. Ms Jahan told the three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, that she wanted her freedom and to see her husband, who would support her financially. She also said that she had been kept in ""unlawful custody"" by her parents. In November, a top court bench allowed Ms Jahan to leave her father's custody and resume her studies.","An Indian woman at the centre of an inter-religious marriage row may now live with her husband, the Supreme Court has ruled."
"Americans will vote for members of both chambers of Congress, as well as for governors in 36 out of 50 states. Between now and then, we'll bring you updates and all the best analysis every weekday in this round-up. Today's round-up includes a fiery debate and some unusual candidates. One quote The last debate between the two contenders for one of Texas' Senate seats took place on Tuesday night - and for Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke, the gloves came off. ""Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,"" he told viewers in the televised debate. ""He is going to make up positions and votes that I've never held."" O'Rourke went on to wield the nickname Donald Trump coined for Cruz during their presidential race: Lyin' Ted. The two have, of course, since cosied up - President Trump has campaigned for Cruz, and will host a rally for him in Houston on Monday. ""It's clear Congressman O'Rourke's pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,"" Cruz retorted. He also accused O'Rourke of being over-eager to impeach the president (a recurring theme in debates these days) and of being out of touch with Texan voters, particularly on immigration issues. Texas hasn't elected a Democrat to state-wide office since 1994. And that may not change this year: a poll average compiled by Real Clear Politics gives Cruz a lead of seven percentage points over O'Rourke. You can read more here on the Texas race from our correspondent James Cook. One number Back in August, Chris Collins, a Republican congressman from New York's 27th district, was indicted on federal crimes - he denies insider trading and lying to investigators. So did he stand aside ahead of his re-election race in the mid-terms after his indictment? Well, despite saying he would at one point, he didn't do so...and now that decision could hit his party. New York's 27th is one of the at least 23 Republican-held districts Democrats hope to flip so they can take control of the House of Representatives. Donald Trump won the area comfortably in the 2016 presidential election (by some 24.5 percentage points). However, even though there are 40,000 more registered Republicans in the district, Collins' lead over Nate McMurray there has narrowed significantly. A Siena College poll yesterday indicated his lead is now only three points. Another statistic that emerged yesterday - Collins received only $6,210 in contributions from individuals in the third quarter of 2018. The zip code analysts over at RollCall worked out that only $80 of that came from people in Collins' own district. McMurray's own filing for the third quarter isn't public yet - but the one for the second quarter showed he received almost $45,000 in donations from individuals.

"Former NBA player Lamar Patterson, 27, was stopped at Brisbane Airport on Thursday after his dog, Kobe, was discovered by border officials. The dog was taken into quarantine and is to be deported to the US on Friday, authorities said. Australia has strict animal quarantine laws to prevent importing infections. Actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard famously fell foul of Australian quarantine laws in 2015 when they smuggled their dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country. Patterson, who signed with Australian team the Brisbane Bullets this week, had spent ""most of the morning with customs officials"", the club said. He had first boarded a domestic flight in the US on American Airlines, which allows pets on board, before connecting to a Qantas flight in Los Angeles. Qantas permits only assistance dogs in the cabin but Kobe went undetected by airline staff, Australian media reported. Coach Andrej Lemanis said there had been ""some confusion"" as Patterson had asked US airport officials about travelling with his pet. ""When he got to [Los Angeles International Airport] no-one said anything to him. He went through security. Somehow he got it on the plane,"" Lemanis said, reported The Courier Mail newspaper. Patterson, who formerly played for the Atlanta Hawks, often features his dog on social media.",Australian authorities have seized a French bulldog from a US basketball player after he flew into the country with the pet in his hand luggage.
"He is the most senior Chinese official to comment on the unrest which has rocked Hong Kong for months. His comments came during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing. Hong Kong has seen months of often-violent protests calling for democracy and less influence from China. The protests were sparked by changes to a law that would allow extradition to mainland China, but have since widened to include calls for an independent inquiry into police brutality and demands for greater democracy. On Wednesday, embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam withdrew the controversial extradition bill but that has failed to appease the activists. Instead, protests continued on Friday evening, when clashes erupted between police and the demonstrators outside a subway station on the Kowloon peninsula. Riot police fired both tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters before clearing the nearby streets as the crowd of protesters was forced to retreat. What did the Chinese premier say? In August, China had likened to protests to terrorism, warning activists not to ""underestimate the firm resolve"" of the Beijing government. Li Keqiang, China's second highest-ranking leader, told reporters on Friday: ""The Chinese government unswervingly safeguards 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong people'."" He said China backed Hong Kong ""to end the violence and chaos in accordance with the law, to return to order, which is to safeguard Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability"". He said the world ""needs to believe that the Chinese people have the ability and wisdom to handle their own matters well"". Merkel calls for dialogue German Chancellor Angela Merkel said a peaceful solution was needed for Hong Kong, urging that ""in the current situation, violence must be prevented"". She said there were signs Ms Lam would invite the necessary dialogue. ""I hope that materialises and that demonstrators have the chance to participate within the frame of citizens' rights."" She also stressed that the ""rights and freedoms"" for the people of Hong Kong ""have to be granted"".

"Galveston Police apologised last year after footage emerged of Donald Neely, 44, arrested for criminal trespassing. A lawsuit filed this week alleged the officers' conduct was ""extreme and outrageous"" and caused Mr Neely injury and emotional and mental anguish. The trespass charges against Mr Neely were later dismissed in court. Many people on social media compared the footage of Mr Neely to the slavery era, an allusion referenced explicitly in the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, the officers should have been aware that Mr Neely, ""being led with a rope and by mounted officers down a city street as though he was a slave, would find this contact offensive"". Accusing both the city and the Galveston police department of negligence, the suit says that Mr Neely ""suffered from handcuff abrasions, suffered from the heat, and suffered from embarrassment, humiliation and fear"". City officials declined to comment on the lawsuit to US media. Last year, after an outcry over images of Mr Neely, police clarified that he was not tied with the rope but was ""handcuffed and a line was clipped to the handcuffs"". Galveston's police chief Vernon Hale said at the time that the technique was acceptable in some scenarios but that ""officers showed poor judgment in this instance"". There was no ""malicious intent"", he said, and apologised to Mr Neely for the ""unnecessary embarrassment"". Department policy was changed to prevent the use of this technique. Mr Neely - who was homeless at the time - was sleeping on a sidewalk, US media reported, when he was arrested for criminal trespass and led around the block to a mounted police patrol staging area. The charges were later dismissed. Following an investigation into the encounter, the department released body camera footage of the arrest. In it, the officers can be heard commenting on the appearance of Mr Neely's arrest. ""This is going to look so bad. I'm glad you're not embarrassed, Mr Neely,"" one officer is heard saying. A status conference is currently scheduled for 7 January, 2021. Mr Neely is requesting a trial by jury, according to court documents.","A black man who was led by a rope down a Texas street by two white officers on horseback has sued the city and its police department for $1m (£750,000)."
"In the video, the officer is seen notifying Mr Romney that the rioters were heading in his direction and guiding him away. The Utah senator, an unpopular figure among Trump supporters, said he looked forward to thanking the police officer for his actions. Officer Goodman was already being praised for his bravery that day, after singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers. Video footage showed him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs. Mr Goodman is then seen glancing towards the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction. Five people, including a police officer, died as a result of the riots. Members of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside, it. A group of senators has introduced a bill to award Officer Goodman with the Congressional Gold Medal. News of his additional heroics involving Senator Romney will only amplify calls for him to be recognised. The senator said he was unaware of the danger he was in until he saw the footage at the trial on Wednesday. It formed part of the Democratic prosecution in trying to underline the peril the heart of US government was under as Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol. Senator Romney said it was ""overwhelmingly distressing and emotional"" to see the violence again, six weeks after the attack. And reflecting on his own narrow escape, he added he was looking forward to thanking Officer Goodman ""when I next see him"". New York Law School criminal law professor and 20-year veteran of the New York City Police Department Kirk Burkhalter called Mr Goodman's response to the rioters ""tremendous"". ""I don't think there was any type of training that would prepare you for that situation,"" Mr Burkhalter told the BBC, speaking days after the attack. In the video shot by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic, Mr Goodman, who is black, is antagonised by the group of Trump supporters - who are all white men. The man at the front of the pack, wearing a QAnon T-shirt, has been identified as Doug Jensen of Iowa. He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. Footage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention on to himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. The image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. ""Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a Confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,"" he said. ""It just reeks of everything we need to correct."" Mr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post. His heroics were noted at the highest level - he was invited to the inauguration as a guest of Vice-President Kamala Harris. Reporting by Holly Honderich",Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman is being called a hero for a second time after footage shown at the impeachment trial shows him directing Mitt Romney away from an advancing mob.

In future they will just be ""listed buildings or places"" with a system of grading to note the importance of the building. Existing historic buildings and sites will be re-surveyed and each given a grade from one to four. Planning and Environment Minister Freddie Cohen said the new system would identify the most important buildings and ensure they were properly protected.

"In a TV interview, Mayor Eduardo Paes said he closed the Joao Havelange stadium on Tuesday because of a risk of the roof collapsing. Further studies were needed to find out what had caused the problem, he said. The stadium is to remain shut as a safety measure until further notice. Mr Paes said he took the decision after receiving the latest of three surveys about the structure. ""It says there is a risk. Our priority here is to protect the lives of the people, that's why we closed it,"" Mr Paes told Brazil's Globo TV channel. The report presented to the mayor said the stadium was at risk of collapse from wind speeds of 60km/h (40mph). 'Confident about Olympics' The Engenhao stadium, as it is known in Brazil, has been used as Rio's main football venue, while the iconic Maracana stadium is renovated for next year's World Cup. Despite the indefinite closure of the Engenhao, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organising committee told the BBC he was confident that the stadium would be ready for the Olympics. The mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, said: ""If it takes a month, then it will stay closed for a month, if it takes a year, it will stay closed for a year."" The stadium was built six years ago and hosted events at the 2007 Pan American Games. Since then, it has been leased to local football club Botafogo. It is scheduled to host athletics events at the Rio Olympics, but the opening and closing ceremonies will take place at the city's Maracana stadium. Its construction was massively over budget, costing the state $190m (£125m). Contractual issues led to the company that started the project leaving before it was finished. The latest setback could make recouping the earlier losses difficult, Mr Paes said. The mayor said that if the cause of the roof problems were found to be due to bad construction work, the companies that oversaw the completion of the project would be held responsible. However, should the problem lie with the project itself, then the City Hall would be forced to shoulder the costs. The closure is an embarrassment for Brazil as it prepares for two of the biggest world sporting events, say correspondents. The authorities have also acknowledged delays in work on the Maracana, and funding problems have also beset a stadium in Sao Paulo, which is set to host the opening match at the 2014 World Cup.","The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has said the stadium due to host the athletics events at the 2016 Olympics will not be demolished, despite structural problems that have led to its closure."
"The two gunboats, Berdyansk and Nikopol, and the Yana Kapa tug were handed over at a location agreed by both Moscow and Kyiv on Monday. Ukraine's foreign ministry said the boats were heading for Odessa. The 24 Ukrainian sailors on board the ships were returned in a deal agreed between Moscow and Kyiv in September. The return of the ships, seized last November as they attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait between Crimea and Russia, comes three days after it was confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet his Ukrainian counterpart for the first time at a summit in Paris. The move marks a slowly improving relationship between the two countries and will be a welcome boost for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, says the BBC's Kyiv correspondent, Jonah Fisher. Seizing the vessels was a serious escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Russian forces annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March 2014 - a move condemned internationally. Crimea has a Russian-speaking majority. How and why were the boats seized? On the morning of 25 November 2018, Ukraine's Berdyansk and Nikopol gunboats - and the Yana Kapa tug - tried to sail from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov. Ukraine says that as the vessels sailed towards the Kerch Strait, they were intercepted by Russians ships, which rammed the tug. The vessels continued for a short distance, but were then prevented from travelling further by a tanker. Russian forces opened fire and several Ukrainian sailors were injured. Ukraine called it an act of Russian aggression, because the Black Sea is free for shipping and annexed Crimea belongs to Ukraine. A 2003 Russia-Ukraine treaty stipulates unimpeded access to the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. Moscow, however, said the ships had illegally entered its waters. The boats were held in Kerch, and all 24 sailors on board were detained. Russian TV later broadcast statements from some of the captured Ukrainian navy men. One commander was quoted as saying he had realised his actions ""were provocative"" and Russian TV said the Ukrainian operation had been carried out by Ukraine's SBU security service. What's the background to this? The shallow Sea of Azov lies east of Crimea, and south of the Ukrainian regions partially seized by pro-Russian separatists. The two Ukrainian ports on its northern shore - Berdyansk and Mariupol - are used to export grain and products such as steel, as well as the coal trade. The 2003 treaty between Ukraine and Russia guaranteed free navigation to both countries' vessels. But in recent years Russia has been inspecting ships going to or from Ukrainian ports. The inspections began after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Crimea. Moscow said the measures were necessary for security reasons, pointing to a potential threat from Ukrainian radicals to a Russian-built bridge that spans the narrow Kerch Strait. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in April 2014. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists. Moscow denies this but says that Russian volunteers are helping the rebels.","Russia has returned three navy boats to Ukraine almost a year after they were seized in the Black Sea off the Crimean Peninsula, officials say."
"President Enrique Pena Nieto's project also aims to boost government revenue by increasing top earners' income tax. The government says the extra cash will go on infrastructure and social security, but critics say it will hurt Mexico's sluggish growth. Mexico recently surpassed the United States as the country with one of the highest obesity rates in the world. A recent report by the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that 32.8% of adult Mexicans are obese, compared to 31.8% of Americans. The country's health authorities say there are more than five million obese children in the country and a 9.2% incidence of diabetes among children. ""Obesity and diabetes are affecting school and work performances, and with it, the country's economic competitiveness,"" Mexico's Health Minister, Mercedes Juan, told reporters on Thursday, at the launch of a country strategy to tackle the problem. Long debate It involves a big push to label unhealthy food, restrict advertisements to protect children and boost physical exercise in schools and workplaces. The Senate approved the tax reform after more than eight hours of debate, proposing amendments that require another vote by the lower house. After the Congress' final approval, it now needs to be sanctioned by President Pena Nieto. The law imposes a levy of 8% on junk food, after the Senate increased it from the 5% originally proposed; and creates a tax of one peso ($0.07; £0.04) on every litre of soft or sugary drinks. The income tax rate for those earning more than 750,000 pesos ($57,000; £36,000) is to go up as high as 35%. The legislators also passed a controversial hike in value added tax (VAT) for border regions, from 11% to 16%. Critics say the actual boost in tax revenue will be small. The original government's proposal aimed at raising an additional 2.7% of tax revenue until 2018. But after the changes passed by the Congress, the package is expected to bring in less than that. The tax hike is part of wide-ranging structural reforms proposed by the Pact for Mexico alliance, led by the president. The broad alliance has already passed a telecommunications reform.",The Mexican Congress has approved a tax reform bill imposing new levies on junk food and soft drinks.
"By Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Alps are sometimes described as Europe's natural trade barriers. From Roman times, the routes across them have been mapped, and fought over. In the Middle Ages, mule teams trekked painstakingly up the alpine passes, carrying everything from salt to wine, metal and leather goods. Accidents were common, and, in winter, the routes were closed. So, when the first rail tunnel through the Gotthard opened in 1882 the then president of Switzerland, Simeon Bavier, could not contain his euphoria: ""A triumph of art and science, a monument to work and diligence! The barrier which divided nations has fallen, the [Swiss Alps] have been breached. Countries have moved closer to each other, the world market is open!"" Today, Italian olive oil destined for the Netherlands or German cars for Greece all still have to cross the Alps. So too do many thousands of tonnes of goods from China or India: they may dock in Rotterdam, but their final destination could be Rome, Vienna or Zagreb. The existing routes across the Alps cannot cope: the old rail tunnel is slow and the Gotthard road tunnel, opened in 1980, now sees more than a million freight lorries a year. Communities in the alpine valleys have long complained about the air and noise pollution. Lorry drivers don't like the tunnel's single-lane structure. In 2001 two lorries collided in the tunnel, causing a fire which killed 11 people. Engineering feat Plans for a better rail tunnel have been around since the 1940s, but it was not until 1992 that Swiss voters backed their government's plan to build a new high-speed rail link through the Alps. Two years later the project got added impetus, when Swiss voters also backed a proposal from environmental groups to move all freight travelling through Switzerland from road to rail. But the plan was ambitious, costly to the Swiss taxpayers who had agreed to pay for it, and fraught with engineering challenges. The first geologists surveying the proposed route suggested it might be impossible to bore a tunnel straight through the Gotthard, because of the unpredictable quality of the rock. Once work began, those challenges soon became apparent. In some areas the rock, one engineer remembers, was ""as soft as butter"" meaning excavation inched along at no more than half a metre a day. In other places things went more smoothly. A massive 10m (30ft) diameter tunnel-boring machine could, on a good day, dig out 40m of tunnel a day - a world record. But the Gotthard is also the world's deepest tunnel, and with 2.3km (1.4 miles) of mountain pressing down on it, gravity constantly tried to close up the space which had been excavated. And so, along the tunnel's length, reinforced steel rings had to be inserted, to prevent it collapsing in on itself. For 17 years, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, more than 2,000 people have worked on the tunnel. There have been accidents: nine tunnel miners have died. A tunnel for Europe But now the tunnel is ready, and Europe's leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, are all arriving to take a look. Twin tunnels running in both directions north-south should transport Europe's freight not only much more safely, but much faster. With no danger of collision, trains will race through the tunnel at speeds of up to 250km/h (155mph). Where older alpine tunnels corkscrewed their way up through the mountains, the new railway line, from Zurich in the north all the way to Lugano in the south, is completely flat and straight. The ultimate goal is a high-speed rail link, with the Gotthard at its heart, connecting Rotterdam to Genoa. It is a project the Swiss are immensely proud of. Switzerland's transport minister, Doris Leuthard, is especially happy that her country, not in the European Union but in the heart of Europe, can contribute something so important to the European economy. ""We are a small country, we are landlocked,"" she explains, ""and we know co-operation is key, and this is a very nice project of co-operation... I think it is very important for Europe. ""I think it symbolises what Europe, and what Swiss engineers can do... and they did a fantastic job."" For the engineers themselves, the opening of the tunnel is going to be a little strange, admits the head of construction company Alptransit, Renzo Simoni, ""Well, it's a milestone,"" he says, ""and of course all of us who worked on it are proud. ""But on the other hand things will be different... the tunnel will be handed over to the railways, and we will just be passengers like all the others.""","The world's longest - and deepest - rail tunnel opens in Switzerland on Wednesday. The Gotthard rail link has taken 20 years to build, and cost more than $12bn (£8.2bn). It will, the Swiss say, revolutionise Europe's freight transport."
"He said prosecutors had greatly exaggerated the frequency of his ""licentious evenings"". There had only been 12 in three years, he said. Mr Strauss-Kahn is accused of helping procure sex workers for a prostitution ring based at a hotel in Lille. He has argued that he did not know the women were prostitutes. Although using prostitutes is not illegal in France, supplying them or assisting in supplying them is. Prosecutors have been quoted as saying Mr Strauss-Kahn, 65, played a pivotal role in facilitating the orgies, describing him as the ""party king"". If found guilty, the one-time potential candidate for the French presidency could face up to 10 years in jail and a €1.5m (£1.13m) fine. 'He did it for fun' As he took the stand on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn said: ""I committed no crime, no offence."" ""The prosecution gives the impression of unbridled activity,"" he told the court. But, he added: ""There were only 12 parties in total - that is four per year over three years."" Mr Strauss-Kahn also denied organising the parties he took part in. ""I am in no way the organiser of these parties. I did not have the time to organise any party,"" he said. As he arrived in court in Lille earlier, three topless protesters from the Femen activist group jumped on his car, with ""pimps, clients, guilty"" painted on their chests. They were taken away by police. The former IMF chief - widely known by his initials DSK - is expected to give evidence for three days. He has not attended the trial since it opened on 2 February, when his appearance attracted international media attention. The day before he was due to testify, an ex-prostitute named Mounia described how she had been paid €900 (£690) by a businessman, David Roquet, for what she had been told would be a ""small party"". She told the court that she had been specifically chosen for Mr Strauss-Kahn and no-one else. Mounia's evidence is expected to play an important part in the trial, as the prosecution tries to prove that he knew she and another woman, Jade, were prostitutes. Mr Roquet, aged 46 and one of the men who organised the parties, said on Monday that he had taken part for ""professional"" purposes. It was important for his construction business and it enabled him to have contact with Mr Strauss-Kahn, he told the court. ""He did it for fun. We had some lovely evenings,"" he told French radio earlier, adding that five or six couples would be involved. Among the 13 co-accused are luxury hotel managers, a lawyer, a former police commissioner and a brothel owner nicknamed ""Dodo the Pimp"". They face charges of ""aggravated pimping"" while the former head of the International Monetary Fund is accused of using his business contacts to hire women for sex parties in Paris, Lille and Washington. It is the latest sex-related allegation to trouble Mr Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down from the IMF after being accused of attempted rape by a hotel maid in New York in 2011. The case also ended his political career. Mr Strauss-Kahn - a Socialist former finance minister - was at the time widely regarded as a top contender for the French presidential election the following year. The charges were eventually dropped and he reached a settlement with the maid, Nafissatou Diallo. Two other cases against him, concerning allegations of sexual assault and gang rape, have already been dropped.","Ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who denies charges of pimping, has told a court in northern France that he took part in only a few rare sex parties."
"The bid for transparency is expected to come into force in the new year. It is thought the information will be available on the government website, once the health department has mastered the required technology. Ramsey MHK Leonard Singer said: ""It is important the people of the island are made aware of why the waiting lists at Noble's Hospital are getting so long"". He added: ""Monthly figures will show if the department is actually working to get these waiting lists down - the Isle of Man population has not been increasing that much and we have quite a large number of specialists, so we need to know why are people having to wait so long."" Although the current average hospital waiting time is 11 weeks, it was revealed in the October sitting of Tynwald that some people were having to wait for more than two years for a specialist appointment. Health Minister David Anderson said: ""In addressing our unacceptable waiting times, I think that we have to accept that in many cases we have simply too much demand placed on our limited resources and that there is no easy answer."" A review of the demands made on the health service is being carried out by the government.",The Isle of Man government has committed to publishing regular updates of hospital waiting lists.
"The court also allowed the actor access to medicines and food from home during his stay in the prison. On Thursday, the actor returned to jail to finish his sentence for firearms offences linked to blasts which killed 257 people in Mumbai in 1993. He has already served 18 months of his five-year term. He was convicted for illegally possessing a rifle and a pistol which he bought from the bombers. He had sought to delay his return to prison to finish a number of films, but the court rejected his appeal. On Thursday night, the actor was sent to Mumbai's Arthur Road prison and Indian media reports say he is expected to be soon moved to Pune's Yerwada prison where he will spend the rest of his sentence. The court allowed the 53-year-old actor to take with him copies of the Bhagvad Gita, Ramayan and Hanuman Chalisa - all Hindu religious texts - in addition to toiletries, including toothpaste, shampoo, slippers and clothes. But Judge GA Sanap rejected Dutt's request to take an electronic cigarette with him, Press Trust of India reported. Instead, the judge advised him to quit smoking, it said. Dutt was convicted in 2006 of buying arms from the bombers but cleared of conspiracy. The attacks left 713 others injured. The son of a Hindu father and a Muslim mother, Dutt said the weapons were necessary in order to defend his family during the Hindu-Muslim rioting of 1993 which followed the destruction by Hindu zealots of the Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya. Dutt, one of Bollywood's most bankable stars, is hugely popular for his role as a lovable gangster in the Munnabhai movies. He has also dabbled in politics. In 2006, a special anti-terror court convicted 100 people for the blasts. Twelve were given the death penalty and 20 others sentenced to life imprisonment. Dutt, the most high-profile among the convicts, was originally charged with five offences, including criminal conspiracy and possession of illegal weapons. In March 2013, India's Supreme Court upheld his conviction, but reduced his sentence from six to five years.","Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt has been allowed to take a mattress, pillow, fan, toiletries and mosquito repellent to jail with him."
"By Maija UnkuriHelsinki Out of work for half a year, Liisa, 26 and from Helsinki, has been looking for a job without success. ""While I'm unemployed I will only get €36 more per month with the basic income. I've always been positive about the idea, though, so it was nice to be one of those who were chosen."" Basic income has frequently been suggested as a way of cutting welfare bureaucracy as well as poverty. But one of the main reasons why Finland's social insurance agency Kela is trying out the monthly tax-free payment of €560 (£490; $600) is to see whether providing a basic income will make the unemployed more eager to go into short-term jobs. Finland has some 213,000 unemployed, a higher rate than its Nordic neighbours, and a working population of 2,413,000. Short-term contracts here have steadily become a key feature of Finland's labour market. The benefit system in many cases provides people with little incentive to go into low-income jobs because welfare is generally cut back if you start earning. ""Every single euro that a person earns diminishes his or her social benefits,"" says Olli Kangas, head of society relations at Kela. ""In some cases an unemployed person is afraid of losing their benefits in the future, if he or she receives a temporary employment."" The idea behind the basic income experiment is that any earnings would be a supplement; €560 a month may not sound much but it is a start. ""The government wants to see if it's possible to eliminate at least the worst disincentives to work,"" says Mr Kangas. Where else in the world? Randomly selected from Finland's unemployed, the 2,000 taking part in the experiment were all receiving the lowest rate of unemployment benefit. After tax, it was little different from the €560 they now receive monthly in basic income. The difference is that they will receive it without filling in a form and irrespective of whether they get a job or not over the next two years. For Liisa Ronkainen, already looking for work for several months, it is certainly an attractive idea. ""Now that I will get a salary in addition to the basic income I might try even harder,"" she suggests. And there was a similar message from another of the participants, Juha Jarvinen, who has been out of work for five years but now hopes to start a new business. ""For my part, the basic income will mean I can escape enslavement and feel that I am a functioning citizen again,"" he told Finnish public broadcaster YLE. The trial has aroused interest worldwide, because it will answer the burning questions about how people out of work will respond to the idea of a basic income. Some might decide to acquire more education or change their career, to make themselves more attractive to the labour market. Others might seek to start a business. But there is always the chance that it could be used as an excuse to take it easy and work as little as possible. Cutting bureaucracy None of those chosen was given a chance to say no, so the outcome of the project will not be slanted. And no-one will receive less money than before. As for cutting red tape, the prime objective behind the pilot, there will be a partial improvement for those taking part. Most of those involved receive additional social benefits in the form of housing benefit or a higher unemployment benefit because they have children. The form procedure to get these will remain unchanged during the experiment. But for Finnish authorities bureaucracy will diminish considerably. If any of the 2,000 start studying, get a job or lose a job or even develop a long-term illness, they will not have to pass the information on. Their basic income will not change. More stories from Finland: As the experiment takes hold, researchers will watch how the chosen group fare in comparison with the rest of the country's unemployed. They have already suggested expanding the experiment, either to increase the number of unemployed people taking part or to widen it to other groups in society. The Finnish centre-right government of Prime Minister Juha Sipila has provided €20m to the project and the research group says most of the money will remain untouched until the start of 2018. ""This is just a start,"" says Olli Kangas. ""In 2018 we would like to start something better."" As for the cost of the experiment, that depends on how many of the 2,000 will find work. The basic income will initially be covered by the money that would have been paid out in unemployment benefit anyway. Costs will only start to build up when people get a job.","""I was so surprised when I got the letter, and a bit sceptical too,"" says Liisa Ronkainen, one of 2,000 Finns chosen for a government experiment to provide unemployed people with a basic income."
"By Frances MaoBBC News, Sydney Its jokes and memes - especially about life as a first-generation migrant - have made the page wildly popular. Almost a million people have joined the group since it began in September. The posts, which can be made by anyone, have also sparked conversations about cultural identity. Its rapid success has stunned the group's founders - nine Chinese-Australian high school students who live in Melbourne. ""We were always sharing memes and jokes about Asian culture and growing up in a foreign country and kind of just wanted a place to share them together,"" co-founder Kathleen Xiao, 18, tells the BBC. Anne Gu, 18, another founder, says they were thrilled when the group hit 1,000 members but ""now it's just gone insane"". ""We didn't think at all that it would get this big, or so serious,"" she says, referring to its growth into an online community for Asian diasporas. She says the initial idea had been to simply share jokes about family life, Asian cultural ""quirks"" and bubble milk tea. (There are a lot of memes about this very popular drink.) What are Subtle Asian Traits? The posts span a range of topics, but they often focus on Asian culture as experienced by the children of migrants. That's why most members are young people from Australia, the US, Canada and the UK, rather than those living in Asia. Ms Xiao believes that the page is so popular because it identifies ""just little things in our lives that no one talked about before"". Many memes are about household customs - such as boiling tap water for drinking or using a finger to measure the perfect amount of water needed to cook rice. Other jokes centre on the experience of being a first-generation Asian person in a Western society, and ""how we struggle, sometimes, to reach a balance between our two cultures"", says Ms Gu. There are memes about ""not being Asian enough"": bilingual mishaps, struggles with Chinese homework, rebelling against family rules and traditions. Then there are posts referencing experiences of casual racism or being made to feel ""not white enough"". A common source of humour is ""Asian parents"" - who are stereotypically portrayed as cautious, strict and overbearing. As a Chinese-Australian millennial, I burst out laughing at one of the group's most popular posts. It was captioned: ""One day I told mother I didn't eat breakfast"". It bore an uncanny resemblance to texts from my own mother, particularly phrases like: ""I did not have a good sleep last night because of this."" Ms Gu says the page is designed to be ""relatable"". Some users have sent the administrators messages of thanks. ""One girl said it was the first time she felt like a sense of belonging,"" she says. Ms Xiao says the page helped her realise her experiences were common. ""Growing up in a foreign country, it's just something you don't talk about because you're afraid that people won't understand you, or that you'll be made into a minority,"" she says. Finding 'the balance' Like other internet groups which attempt to offer insights on cultural identity, there are some inherent challenges. Some initial criticism suggested that the group wasn't inclusive of all Asian cultures, as most posts related to East Asia. Ms Gu says the administrators have since prioritised including more diverse content. And in the group's rules (of which there are five, because four is an unlucky number in Chinese culture), users are encouraged to ""be inclusive to all Asian races"". Other critics have said that memes about ""tiger"" parents or bad driving serve to reinforce negative stereotypes. One user on Reddit equated the humour to internalised racism and ""self hate"". Ms Gu acknowledges that some of the humour plays off stereotypes, but argues that most post-makers ""have generally come to terms with their cultural identity"". ""They understand the balance,"" she says. Such posts can also help people ""to experience potentially negative experiences in childhood in a more humorous and positive light... like a healing through humour"". She adds that the page has also deepened her own cultural pride - something she had not expected. ""I hope it gives others the confidence too, to not be so shy about their culture,"" she says.","For many people of Asian descent living overseas, a Facebook group called Subtle Asian Traits has become a cultural phenomenon."
"Liu Han, ex-head of mining conglomerate Sichuan Hanlong Group, stood trial on Monday at a court in Xianning with his brother Liu Wei and 34 others. The trial comes amid a crackdown on corruption by President Xi Jinping. The Liu brothers are charged with 15 crimes including murder, assault and illegal detention. Their gang, active since 1993, are being charged in connection with nine murders. Sichuan link Liu Han has been detained since March last year. He was ranked 148th on Forbes' list of the richest Chinese business people in 2012 and his former company, Sichuan Hanlong Group, once tried to take over Australian miner Sundance Resources Ltd. Chinese state media said that the Sichuan-based gang had had strong political ties that played a role in Liu Han's appointment as a delegate in Sichuan's political advisory body. In recent months, several top officials from Sichuan province have come under scrutiny. These investigations have come amid rumours that ex-security chief Zhou Yongkang is being investigated for corruption. Mr Zhou was the party secretary in Sichuan province before becoming head of China's Public Security Ministry in 2003. There has been no official confirmation that any investigation is under way.","The trial of a ""mafia-style gang"" in China accused of gunning down rivals, bribery and corruption has begun, state media say."
"Another 25 militants were wounded when the camp in Hajr, west of the port city of Mukalla, was bombed on Tuesday. The US defence department earlier said it estimated dozens of people had died. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has exploited the current conflict in Yemen to expand the territory under its control. Over the past year, the Houthi rebel movement and military units loyal to the former president have been battling a US-backed, Saudi-led coalition supporting the internationally-recognised government. Almost 6,300 people, half of them civilians, have been killed in the fighting. 'Denying AQAP safe haven' The US has continued its campaign of drone and missile strikes against AQAP throughout the conflict, resulting in the deaths of a number of senior figures, including the group's leader Nasser al-Wuhayshi in June and its combat operations chief Jalal Baleedi last month. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said the training camp targeted on Tuesday was located in a mountainous area and was being used by more than 70 militants. ""We continue to assess the results of the operation, but our initial assessment is that dozens of AQAP fighters have been removed from the battlefield,"" he added. ""This strike deals a blow to AQAP's ability to use Yemen as a base for attacks that threaten US persons, and it demonstrates our commitment to defeating al-Qaeda and denying it safe haven."" Mr Cook gave no further details about the attack, but Yemeni security officials and witnesses told the Associated Press that it hit a former military base about 75km (47 miles) west of Mukalla, which AQAP seized along with most of the surrounding province of Hadramawt last year. Medics and a local official told the Reuters news agency that as many 50 militants had been killed in the attack, while a tribesman told AP that at least 40 had died. ""The planes struck as al-Qaeda people stood in line to receive their dinner,"" the local official said. Tribal sources told the AFP news agency that wounded militants were taken to a hospital in Mukalla, and residents of the city reported seeing dozens of militants rushing to the facility to give blood. The US considers AQAP as one of the deadliest offshoots of the jihadist network founded by Osama bin Laden. The group attempted to bomb a US-bound airliner in 2009 and claimed responsibility for the attack on the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris last year that left 12 people dead.","At least 40 militants have been killed in a US air strike on an al-Qaeda training camp in south-eastern Yemen, local officials and medics say."
"Mr Panetta's visit to the country marks his first since US operatives killed Osama Bin Laden in Abbottabad on 2 May, prompting a backlash from Pakistan. US officials have said a strong relationship with Pakistan is vital in the battle against al-Qaeda. Some lawmakers have suggested Pakistan was helping to hide Bin Laden. Mr Panetta had dinner on Friday with Army Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and the head of Pakistan's spy agency, Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, US and Pakistani officials said. During the meal, the men reportedly spoke about establishing a joint intelligence team to hunt down at least five other military targets inside Pakistan. Since the raid on Bin Laden's compound, Pakistan has sent home most US Army trainers within its borders and said it no longer wishes to have financial assistance from the US. 'Talks going slowly' Officials said attempts to repair the relationship, which US officials have said is imperative in the war in Afghanistan and the fight against al-Qaeda, were going slowly. It is unclear how long Mr Panetta will stay in Islamabad. Meanwhile, Afghan President Hamid Karzai has begun a two-day trip to Pakistan and is expected to discuss what role Pakistan can play in negotiations with the Taliban. CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have also visited Pakistan to help repair relations since the raid by the US Navy Seals. Following their efforts, Pakistan allowed the CIA to re-examine the Bin Laden compound. The country also returned the tail of a helicopter that broke off during the raid.","US CIA director Leon Panetta has met Pakistani officials for talks on repairing the relationship between the two nations, officials have said."
"The industrial action was cancelled following a meeting held between the drivers represented by the union Unite and bus operator CT Plus earlier. Drivers had planned to strike over ongoing issues with rotas and working hours. The action, due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday, was voted for by drivers on Sunday. 'Nothing changed' Kevin Hart, general manager for CT Plus in the Channel Islands, said: ""There were a few issues, the main one being a slight change in duty cards - that's the shift process that drivers carry out every day. ""We had three additional journeys that we needed to add on so there was a slight change to the ones that were agreed in July. ""We've looked at that change and come to a solution."" He said ""nothing's really changed"" but the company and drivers had agreed in writing to more regular meetings and communication. Mr Hart said discussions were continuing over putting something in place to cover the lack of strike legislation in Guernsey. Public apology He said currently drivers could announce a strike with little or no notice. Mr Hart said: ""We're going to re-look at the recognition agreement we've got with the union and come up with a more robust dispute resolution system. ""We can just apologise for any inconvenience and unrest this may have caused over the last few days."" Drivers' duty cards are due to change in October when the winter timetable comes in. Mr Hart said this would be discussed with drivers before the final version was agreed.",A planned two-day strike by Guernsey's public bus drivers has been called off.
"The International Court of Justice in the Hague said Thailand must withdraw troops from around the hilltop temple. But it did not give Cambodia all the disputed land, saying it had no jurisdiction to rule on a hill nearby. Both governments welcomed the ruling, with the Thai prime minister calling on her people to accept the verdict. In a televised address, Yingluck Shinawatra told Thais that both countries would work together to achieve peace. Her Cambodian counterpart, Hun Sen, also addressed his nation, repeating a promise to work with Thailand to keep the border peaceful and ""not do anything that will lead to tension"". ""This is a significant step forward... towards a peaceful resolution,"" he said. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Bangkok says the ruling was a qualified victory for Cambodia, and the two sides will now have to negotiate. The 900-year-old Hindu temple is perched on a cliff in Cambodia, but more easily accessed from the Thai side. Fears of violence The long-standing rift has previously led to clashes between the two nations, which both lay claim to the land. A 1962 verdict by the court declared the temple to be Cambodian, but did not rule on the area around it. Cambodia sought a clarification of the ruling two years ago, after fighting erupted. Delivering the judgement, Peter Tomka, president of the International Court of Justice, said the court had decided ""that Cambodia had sovereignty over the whole territory of the promontory of Preah Vihear"". ""In consequence, Thailand was under an obligation to withdraw from that territory the Thai military or police forces or other guards or keepers that were stationed there,"" he said. Both sides agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed area in December 2011. On Saturday, the chief of Cambodia's military forces on the Thailand border called an emergency meeting after Thai aircraft were seen flying low around disputed land near the temple. However, Cambodian regional commander General Srey Deuk told the BBC he expected no problems with the Thai military after Monday's verdict. He said no troop reinforcements had been brought up to the temple. But fears remain about possible violence in border villages, stirred up by nationalist groups. One Thai nationalist group, the Thai Patriotic Network, has said it will reject any judgement from the ICJ, according to The Nation newspaper. The group has already petitioned the court to throw out the case. The territory has been a point of contention for over a century. The decision to award the temple to Cambodia in 1962 rankled Thailand, but the issue lay largely moribund due to Cambodia's civil war, which only ended in the 1990s. It came to the forefront again when Cambodia applied for Unesco World Heritage status in 2008, which it won - angering Thai nationalists. Both sides began a build-up of troops in the area. The ICJ ruling is an interpretation of the 1962 judgement and cannot be appealed.","Cambodia should have sovereignty over most of the disputed land around the Preah Vihear temple on the border with Thailand, the UN's top court has ruled."
"The language can now appear on official documents, although Arabic will remain the language of government. A two-term limit on the presidency was lifted in 2008 to allow Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a third term. The limit is part of a package of constitutional reforms that authorities say will strengthen democracy. Opposition leaders have dismissed the changes as superficial. The Berber language - known locally as Amazigh - was recognised in 2002 as a national language, meaning it could be taught officially in schools in Berber-speaking regions. But Berbers pushed for it to be awarded official status, meaning it would also be accepted on administrative documents. The Berbers were the original inhabitants of North Africa before the seventh century Arab invasion, and they now make up 13 million of Algeria's 39 million people. Among the other reforms are the promise of an independent electoral commission and recognition of the roles of women and youth. And the president will be required to nominate a prime minister from the largest party in parliament. The changes were among those promised by President Bouteflika following the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. The scrapping of terms limits allowed Mr Bouteflika to stand for a third term in 2009. The 78-eight-year old president was re-elected again in 2014 but has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke the previous year. The package was passed by 499 votes to two, with 16 abstentions, senate speaker Abdelkader Bensalah said. ""This project crowns the process of political reforms promised by the head of state,"" said Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal. The reforms guaranteed ""democratic change by means of free elections"" and were ""a bulwark against the vagaries of political change"", he added. But opposition critics say the reforms are little more than a show and will do little to reduce the grip on power held by Mr Bouteflika and his inner circle. With his terms nearly at an end, there are fears of instability in the mainly Muslim country of 40 million, a key energy producer. Unlike many countries in the region, including its neighbours Libya and Tunisia, Algeria was unaffected by the Arab Spring. But it is facing a range of challenges, including regular jihadist attacks and sporadic outbreaks of violence between Berbers and Arabs.",Algerian MPs have passed a package of reforms that include reinstating a limit on presidential terms and giving the Berber language official status.
"Timothy Piazza, 19, died that February after suffering injuries at a ""pledge"" event for a fraternity at Pennsylvania State University. The amount of the settlement will remain private, US media say. The fraternity has also agreed to reforms. The family can still continue with suits against individual defendants. Jim and Evelyn Piazza's settlement with the Beta Theta Pi fraternity's national organisation mandates that all chapters be alcohol- and substance-free by August 2020, ABC News reports. It is part of a 17-point conduct reform programme ""aimed at averting another preventable death"". Any decisions about the now-closed chapter house at Penn State will also need Mr and Mrs Piazza's approval. A resolution banning hard alcohol at any chapter events, nationwide, was approved by 66 fraternities following outrage over alcohol-related student deaths. The policy will be adopted by 1 September of next year in 6,100 chapters on 800 campuses. Beta Theta Pi chairman S Wayne Kay said in a statement that Timothy's death remained ""one of the greatest disappointments and darkest hours in Beta's history"". Fraternity member Ryan Burke, 21, pleaded guilty to hazing and unlawful acts in June. He was sentenced to three months of house arrest, 100 hours of community service and thousands of dollars in fines. Twenty-five defendants still face charges over Timothy's death. Last month, a Pennsylvania judge tossed out the most serious charges - involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment - after prosecutors refiled them. What happened? Timothy Piazza, a second-year engineer student from Lebanon, New Jersey, attended an initiation ritual at the fraternity house on 2 February. Throughout the evening, Timothy and other students participated in binge-drinking activities before he fell down a flight of stairs. In a group text message just before midnight, one of the fraternity members wrote: ""Also, Tim Piazza might actually be a problem. He fell 15 feet down a flight of stairs, hair-first, going to need help."" After the fall he was slapped in the face, shaken and thrown on to a couch, where he remained for most of the night, according to a grand jury report. In the early hours of 3 February, members of the fraternity carried him to another couch after finding him on a basement floor with blood on his face, the report said. Nearly 12 hours later, a fraternity member called an ambulance. Timothy died the next day of traumatic brain injury.",The parents of a student who died in a hazing incident at a US university last year have reached a settlement with the college social club responsible.
"Officers assumed the man was either hallucinating or drunk when he said a persistent pig was following him home. ""(We) responded to the obviously drunk guy walking home from the bar at 5:26 in the morning,"" they said on Facebook. But when they arrived they found a ""very sober"" man who wasn't too keen on bringing home the bacon. The unidentified ""victim"" was indeed being followed by a pig and didn't know what to do, the North Ridgeville Police Department said. An officer was able to ""wrangle"" the swine into the back of his police car and even managed to snap a photograph. It was then taken to the cells - or more accurately the police dog kennels - before being returned to its rightful owner on Sunday morning. ""We will mention the irony of the pig in a police car now so that anyone that thinks they're funny is actually unoriginal and trying too hard,"" the police quipped.","Police are used to getting unusual calls, but one man in the US state of Ohio made a particularly memorable one in the early hours of Saturday morning."
"The Axios news website said Mr Trump had asked several national security officials about the possibility. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said the results would be ""devastating"". Mr Trump has denied making the suggestion. Hurricanes typically affect the US east coast, often causing serious damage. It's not the first time the idea has been considered. Following reports of Mr Trump's suggestion, the hashtag #ThatsHowTheApocalyseStarted has been trending on Twitter. What effect would nuking a hurricane have? Mr Trump asked why the US couldn't drop a bomb into the eye of the storm to stop it from making landfall, news site Axios said. The NOAA says that using nuclear weapons on a hurricane ""might not even alter the storm"" and the ""radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the tradewinds to affect land areas"". The difficulty with using explosives to change hurricanes, it says, is the amount of energy needed. The heat release of a hurricane is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. Even though the mechanical energy of a bomb is closer to that of the storm, ""the task of focusing even half of the energy on a spot in the middle of a remote ocean would be formidable"", it adds. ""Attacking weak tropical waves or depressions before they have a chance to grow into hurricanes isn't promising either,"" says the NOAA. ""About 80 of these disturbances form every year in the Atlantic basin but only about five become hurricanes in a typical year. There is no way to tell in advance which ones will develop."" How long has this idea been around? The idea of bombing a hurricane has been around since the 1950s when the suggestion was originally made by a government scientist. During a speech at the National Press Club in 1961, Francis Riechelderfer, head of the US Weather Bureau, said he could ""imagine the possibility of someday exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea"". The Weather Bureau would only begin acquiring nuclear weapons when ""we know what we're doing"", he added, according to National Geographic. The NOAA says the idea is often suggested during hurricane season. George Washington University Professor Sharon Squassoni says the idea stems from the Plowshares Program of the 1950s when a ""laundry list of different weird... fantastical, slightly crazy"" uses for nuclear weapons was devised by government researchers. In nearly 20 years, the US exploded 31 warheads in 27 tests in order to test whether America's nuclear arsenal could be used to excavate canals or mines, or create a harbour for ships. As the dangers of radiation became more clear, the notion was dropped, Prof Squassoni tells BBC News, adding that current international treaties would ban the US from exploding a nuclear weapon in a hurricane. Several other outlandish ideas have been floated in recent years, including one Facebook event calling for US gun owners to ""shoot down"" Hurricane Irma in 2017 with bullets and flamethrowers. The event attracted 55,000 people to sign up and was taken seriously enough by one Florida sheriff that he issued a stern warning on Twitter saying: ""You won't make it turn around & it will have very dangerous side effects."" When is the US hurricane season? The Atlantic Hurricane season runs from 1 June until the end of November. The peak of the season comes in September when sea temperatures are at their highest. Tropical Storm Dorian is currently swirling towards the Caribbean islands and is forecast to become a hurricane by Tuesday, and will threaten the US island territory of Puerto Rico in the coming days. When asked for a comment by BBC News, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the agency is focused on Dorian and deferred questions on the ""topic of hurricanes and nukes"" to the NOAA guidelines. The NOAA warned earlier this month that conditions were now more favourable for above-normal hurricane activity. It is predicting between 10 and 17 named storms, of which 5-9 will become hurricanes, including 2-4 major hurricanes. Four named storms have formed so far this year. They were Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dorian.","Using nuclear weapons to destroy hurricanes is not a good idea, a US scientific agency has said, following reports that President Donald Trump wanted to explore the option."
"His conservative coalition has defied polls and is leading with 77 seats, the Australian Electoral Commission says. Only 76 are needed for a majority. ""I've always believed in miracles,"" Mr Morrison told supporters in his victory speech on Saturday night. Exit polls had predicted a Labor Party win for the first time in six years. Labor leader Bill Shorten resigned in the wake of his party's surprise defeat, telling members: ""It is obvious that Labor will not be able to form the next government."" He will not seek re-election as party leader. The final result may not be known for some hours, but with more than 76% of votes counted the Liberal-National Coalition has won or is predicted to win 77 seats, with Labor trailing on 68 seats. If the coalition fails to win an outright majority it will need the help of independent MPs to govern. Australia has mandatory voting and a record 16.4 million voters enrolled for the election, which returns a new House of Representatives and just over half of the seats in the Senate. Celebrating victory In his victory speech on Saturday night, Mr Morrison paid tribute to ""the quiet Australians"" who voted for the coalition. ""It's been those Australians who have worked hard every day, they have their dreams, they have their aspirations, to get a job, to get an apprenticeship, to start a business, to meet someone amazing,"" he said. ""To start a family, to buy a home, to work hard and provide the best you can for your kids. To save for your retirement. These are the quiet Australians who have won a great victory tonight!"" On Sunday morning, he joined a service at the Pentecostal Horizon Church in Sydney, where he thanked the congregation for their support. ""You don't get to be a prime minister and serve in that capacity unless you first are a member of your local electorate."" He later watched his team, the Cronulla Sharks, play a rugby league match, drawing cheers from the crowd. Why was the election important? Australia holds elections every three years but, with infighting rife, no prime minister has succeeded in serving a full term since 2007. Mr Morrison said he had united his government - a coalition between his Liberal Party and its traditional ally, the National Party - in the nine months since he replaced Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister. Surveys showed that the economy, cost of living, environment and health were central concerns for voters, while younger people in particular voiced frustration about climate change and a lack of affordable housing. Mr Morrison campaigned primarily on economic issues, often doing so alone while painting the election as a choice between himself and Mr Shorten. Mr Shorten promised to cut tax breaks for the wealthy and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. There were fierce debates about the rolling leadership turmoil, formal recognition of indigenous Australians, and the treatment of female MPs in parliament. ""I think people have become afraid after a very negative campaign,"" Labor supporter Julie Nelson told Reuters at the party's Melbourne election night function. ""They [the Liberals] managed to convince people they should be afraid of change.""

"Mary Horomanski from Erie said the latest bill showed that she had to pay the entire amount by November 2018. ""My eyes just about popped out of my head,"" she told the Erie Times-News. ""We had put up Christmas lights and I wondered if we had put them up wrong."" The electricity provider later said the actual amount was $284.46. A company's spokesman said it did not know how the error had occurred, stating that Ms Horomanski had to pay $284,460,000,000 with a first payment of $28,176 due later in December.

"In a statement, Twitter said the pair spoke about ""protecting the health of the public conversation"" ahead of the US 2020 general election. Earlier Mr Trump had accused the platform of being ""very discriminatory"" towards him. Mr Trump tweeted a picture of Mr Dorsey and him in the Oval Office and called it a ""great meeting"". ""Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general,"" he wrote. Mr Dorsey thanked the president in a reply to his tweet. ""Twitter is here to serve the entire public conversation, and we intend to make it healthier and more civil,"" the Twitter CEO wrote. The meeting came just hours after the president posted two tweets repeating his longstanding claim that the platform is politically biased. He said Twitter did not ""treat me well as a Republican"" and accused it of limiting the number of people who follow him. ""Constantly taking people off list. Big complaints from many people,"" he wrote, claiming the numbers would be higher ""if Twitter wasn't playing their political games"". The company has consistently denied accusations of bias, and said fluctuations in Mr Trump's follower numbers result from purges of suspected bots. Mr Trump - a famously prolific Twitter user - has about 60 million followers. He has used the platform in the past to launch scathing attacks on journalists, politicians and foreign nations, drawing intense criticism.

"By Jessica MurphyBBC, Toronto A contrite Justin Trudeau admitted that he never told anyone about his history of dressing in blackface or brownface - not even the Liberal party members first vetting his candidacy. In his lengthy second mea culpa since the scandal broke, he said he was too embarrassed about the incidents to raise them with anyone. He also conceded that he couldn't rule out more instances coming to light, noting he had no recollection of one of the occasions now in the public domain. Mr Trudeau said at the time, he didn't understand the hurt his actions could cause, because of ""the layers of privilege that I have"". Shachi Kurl, a pollster with the Angus Reid Institute, called the release of the images and footage a ""massive cannonball"" that could strike at the core of Mr Trudeau's brand. A new opinion survey published on Thursday by the institute suggest Canadians see his top attributes as tolerance and compassion. ""Justin Trudeau's brand to this point - until today - has been unassailable on the question of tolerance and pretty unassailable on the question compassion,"" she told the BBC. ""He has a very large base of goodwill on those issues."" Three instances of Trudeau in blackface: She notes this is a second real hit to Mr Trudeau that could shatter his cultivated political image. The SNC-Lavalin affair, a political crisis related to attempts to pressure a former attorney general to cut a deal for a firm facing a corruption trial, saw his popularity drop sharply in the polls earlier this year. Liberal support dropped below the support for the Conservative Party at the time. Ms Kurl says in recent weeks, progressives and centre-left voters have been slowly rallying back around Mr Trudeau and the Liberals. This incident could reverse that trend, she says. That backing could move to other parties on the left - the NDP or the Greens - or leave voters undecided. The questions Ms Kurl is asking are: ""Do they stay with Mr Trudeau or do they scatter? Can they pull they back together again or is it too late?"" It could also alienate a key demographic for Mr Trudeau - younger voters. ""The second question is what is the impact on voter suppression,"" she said. ""Does this turn off young voters and then have them just stay home?"" Kevin Bosch is a former deputy director of the Liberal Research Bureau, during which time he provided strategic research and advice to Liberal leaders including Mr Trudeau. Mr Bosch said that while this will definitely knock the Liberal campaign off track for a few days, ""I don't think it'll be fatal for Trudeau"". He said that Mr Trudeau has built up enough goodwill over the last four years as a vocal supporter of a multicultural Canada. ""This could have been very damaging to Trudeau - if it came in 2015,"" he said. ""When you've been a prime minister for a period of time, voters tend to focus on your record in government."" He said if it had come out in the last election - when voters did not know Mr Trudeau as they do now - it might have collapsed the Liberal campaign and changed the eventual outcome: a Liberal majority. Like Canada, the Liberal Party is diverse. Before the story broke and throughout the following day, Mr Trudeau was busy contacting many minority Liberal candidates as well as various community leaders, offering apologies for his actions. Liberal candidate Greg Fergus, who is black, told journalists in Ottawa that he was contacted on Wednesday night by Mr Trudeau, CTV News reported. ""There was a lot of confusion and hurt last night by the black community,"" he said, but added that Mr Trudeau had built up a good ""track record"" within the community. ""I will say this to all of you, I don't believe that anybody has ever lived their lives without making errors,"" he said. Liberal candidate Randeep Sarai says he was ""saddened"" when the photos emerged. ""For me, it's difficult to understand,"" he tell the BBC. ""The person in those photos from 20 years ago isn't the person that I've worked with the last four years. He has an impeccable record on promoting diversity, calling out intolerance and breaking down the barriers in this country for people who look like me."" He said he has accepted Mr Trudeau's apology. We have yet to see how the election polling - which has had the two main parties neck and neck- is affected by this crisis. But the Canadians that the BBC spoke to on the streets of Toronto and Ottawa on Thursday were mostly unmoved by the news. It's a non-issue, said one, in sentiments that were echoed by others. Prof Cheryl Thompson has studied the phenomenon of blackface in Canada, and she calls it ""as Canadian as hockey"". While the genre of performance began in the US, she says, it was part of Canadian culture by the mid-1800s. ""The only difference [between Canada and the US] is that we haven't had a culture where we contend with race in terms of our national discourse,"" she says. Prof Thompson says this incident is an opportunity to address ""a knowledge gap"" about Canada's own history. ""There is something about our culture that we are now being forced to confront in ways that we haven't been asked to confront before."" On a personal level, Prof Thompson, who is black, says that as a longtime Liberal voter the images have given her pause. ""How can I vote for someone who doesn't seem to understand who I am as a person? ""And I just think Justin Trudeau, for all the stuff that he says, I don't think understands black and brown people as much as he says that he does.""",Three instances of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing blackface or brownface - widely accepted as racist caricatures - have landed like a bombshell in the Canadian election campaign. What does this mean for his chances of winning?
"The $12bn plant in Orissa is India's largest foreign investment project. Critics of the project say it will exhaust iron ore deposits in 20 years. India earlier rejected plans by mining giant Vedanta to extract bauxite in eastern Orissa state saying it would damage the local environment. A panel of India's environment ministry has been investigating to see if Posco's project has been complying with the country's green law, including rehabilitating and resettling local people displaced by it. Three out of the panel's four members have now recommended that environmental clearances for the project be cancelled, saying there are flaws in the manner in which it is being implemented. The panel's report is not final, but could have an influence on the eventual outcome and at the very least, delay it considerably, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi. Posco said it still wanted to go ahead with the project. ""We, of course, want to proceed with this project. We are now watching closely the development. We will withhold any further comment until the environment ministry makes a final decision,"" a company spokesman told AFP news agency. The project was conceived in 2005 and is India's single biggest foreign investment. Based in the port city of Paradip, it was expected to create nearly 50,000 jobs. But it has been opposed by many groups who argue that Posco will exhaust Orissa's iron ore resources in two decades while creating lasting environmental damage.",An Indian government panel has recommended that environmental clearances for a steel plant to be built by South Korean company Posco be scrapped.
"By Owen Bennett-JonesBBC News UK authorities investigating the MQM for alleged money laundering also found a list of weapons in an MQM property. A Pakistani official has told the BBC that India has trained hundreds of MQM militants over the past 10 years. The Indian authorities described the claims as ""completely baseless"". The MQM also strongly denied the claims. Party spokesman Saif Muhammad Ali told BBC Urdu that the MQM had never received any funding or training from India. He said authorities in Pakistan were running a campaign against the party. With 24 members in the National Assembly, the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) has long been a dominant force in the politics of Pakistan's largest city, Karachi. British authorities held formal recorded interviews with senior MQM officials who told them the party was receiving Indian funding, the BBC was told. Meanwhile a Pakistani official has told the BBC that India has trained hundreds of MQM militants in explosives, weapons and sabotage over the past 10 years in camps in north and north-east India. Before 2005-2006 the training was given to a small number of mid-ranking members of the MQM, the official said. More recently, greater numbers of more junior party members have been trained. The claims follow the statement of a senior Karachi police officer that two arrested MQM militants said they had been trained in India. In April, Rao Anwar gave details of how the two men went to India via Thailand to be trained by the Indian intelligence agency RAW. In response, MQM leader Altaf Hussain issued a tirade of abuse at Rao Anwar. Asked about the claims of Indian funding and training of the MQM, the Indian High Commission in London said: ""Shortcomings of governance cannot be rationalised by blaming neighbours."" The UK authorities started investigating the MQM in 2010 when a senior party leader, Imran Farooq, was stabbed to death outside his home in north London. In the course of those inquiries the police found around £500,000 ($787,350) in the MQM's London offices and in the home of MQM leader Altaf Hussain. That prompted a second investigation into possible money laundering. Who is Altaf Hussain? Pakistan's powerful but absent politician In the course of the inquiries the UK authorities found a list itemising weapons, including mortars, grenades and bomb-making equipment in an MQM property, according to Pakistani media reports that the BBC believes to be credible. The list included prices for the weapons. Asked about the list, the MQM made no response. As the UK police investigations have progressed, the British judiciary has been taking an increasingly tough line on the MQM. Back in 2011 a British judge adjudicating an asylum appeal case found that ""the MQM has killed over 200 police officers who have stood up against them in Karachi"". Last year another British judge hearing another such case found: ""There is overwhelming objective evidence that the MQM for decades had been using violence."" The MQM is also under pressure in Pakistan. In March the country's security forces raided the party's Karachi headquarters. They claimed to have found a significant number of weapons there. The MQM said they were planted. The party has a solid support base made up of the Mohajirs, or refugees who left India at the time of partition so that they could settle in Pakistan. The Mohajirs complain that they have been the subject of sustained discrimination in Pakistan. The MQM insists it is a peaceful, secular party representing the interests of the middle classes in Pakistan. As well as its electoral base, the MQM has formidable street power. When it orders a strike the streets empty and the whole of Karachi grinds to a halt. Altaf Husain has lived in self-imposed exile in the UK for more than 20 years. He was given a British passport in 2002. For many years the party has been accused of using violence to impose its will in Karachi. A number of MQM officials, including Altaf Hussain, have been arrested in relation to the money-laundering case but no-one has been charged. The party insists that all its funds are legitimate and that most of them come from donors in the business community in Karachi. India has long accused Pakistani officials of involvement in sponsoring militant attacks in India. Delhi, for example, has demanded that Pakistan take firmer action against those suspected of plotting and managing the Mumbai attacks of 2008. The latest developments in the MQM case suggest that Pakistan will now counter such complaints with demands that India stop sponsoring violent forces in Karachi.","Officials in Pakistan's MQM party have told the UK authorities they received Indian government funds, the BBC learnt from an authoritative Pakistani source."

In it, a group wearing ski masks and identifying itself as the ""Popular Nationalist Insurgency Command of the Large Brazilian Integralist Family"", appear to attack the production company offices with Molotov cocktails. A statement, read with a digitally disguised voice, criticises Netflix and describes the film as blasphemous. It also includes flags with nationalist and fascist connotations, Reuters news agency reports. The video circulated on Christmas Day - one day after Porta dos Fundos (Back Door) announced their office had been attacked. No-one was hurt in the early-hours incident and a security guard was able to extinguish the blaze, the group said. In a tweet they said, in Portuguese, that they were confident that the country would ""survive this torment of hatred, and love will prevail together with freedom of expression"". Their short Portuguese-language film, titled The First Temptation of Christ, has attracted criticism from religious groups and figures since its early-December release.

"Long sentences and fines will also apply to those found to incite ""hatred or contempt"" towards the coup leaders, the military said. The legal changes were announced as armoured vehicles appeared on the streets of several cities. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in protests in recent days. The demonstrators are demanding the release from detention of their elected leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and the restoration of democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma. On Monday, Ms Suu Kyi's lawyer said she would be detained for a further two days. She will then be tried via video link at a court in the capital Nay Pyi Taw on Wednesday, Khin Maung Zaw added. Ms Suu Kyi was rounded up with other members of the government on 1 February, but her detention was due to end on 15 February, according to Reuters news agency. The charges against her include possession of unlawful communication devices - walkie-talkies used by her security staff. Her party was elected in a resounding victory last November, but the military has alleged voter fraud without providing proof. Internet access in Myanmar is being blocked for a second consecutive night, an internet service provider has told BBC Burmese. What are the new punishments protesters face? The ruling junta has threatened long prison sentences and fines on anyone found to incite hatred towards the military, ""by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation"". In a statement posted on a military website on Monday, it said that people preventing the security forces from carrying out their duties could face 20 years in prison, while those found to stir up fear or unrest in public could be imprisoned for terms of three to seven years. The military government on Saturday gave itself the power to make arrests, carry out searches and hold people for more than 24 hours without a court ruling. It has also told journalists not to describe the military's takeover as a coup. What is happening on the streets? The military's heightened presence is the latest sign of a potential crackdown on opposition to the coup. At many strategic locations, soldiers have replaced the police. In the main city, Yangon, eight-wheeled armoured vehicles have been seen trying to navigate the rush-hour traffic, sometimes surrounded by cars honking their opposition to the coup. Protests focused on the central bank building, the US and Chinese embassies, and the city headquarters of Ms Su Kyi's National League for Democracy. As demonstrators gathered in the central city of Mandalay again on Monday, there were reports of security forces firing rubber bullets to disperse crowds. In footage posted on social media, the sound of what appears to be gunshots can be heard as crowds flee, with several people later appearing to display injuries. Police in the city were also reported to have used sling-shots against protesters and were met with volleys of bricks. A leading student activist who has gone into hiding, Myo Ko Ko, told the BBC why he and others were willing to risk their lives. ""We strongly believe in democracy and human rights. We know that it's risky,"" he said. ""I have to move to another place day by day because of being searched (for) by police. We hope the international community will help us."" In the city of Myitkyina, in Kachin state, shooting could also be heard as security forces clashed with anti-coup demonstrators. It was not clear whether rubber bullets or live rounds were fired. Students also protested in Nay Pyi Taw. Dozens were arrested and later released. A doctor at a hospital in Nay Pyi Taw told the BBC the security forces were carrying out night-time raids on homes. ""I'm still worrying because they [made] a curfew statement... not to go outside between 20:00 and 04:00, but this makes a time for the police and soldiers to arrest people like us,"" said the doctor, who cannot be named for safety reasons. ""The previous day they [broke] into the house, cut down the fence, entered and arrested people unlawfully. That's why I'm also worrying."" Residents in several cities are reported to have formed night-watch groups to deter mobs rumoured to have been dispatched by the military to cause unrest.

"The area around the 100kg (220-pound) Soviet bomb - found on a building site late on Tuesday - was cordoned off. The disruption affected north-south rail traffic and flights were diverted from the nearby Tegel airport. German experts later said they had safely defused the bomb on the spot. The bomb was found about 1.5km (a mile) north of the station, in the area of Heidestrasse, which was immediately cordoned off, along with nearby streets. Residents in the immediate vicinity were evacuated. The German news website RBB said river transport was halted between Spree and Nordhafen, and flights were briefly diverted from Tegel to avoid overflying the railway station. There are thought to be thousands of unexploded bombs buried in Germany. In 2010, three people were killed when one unexpectedly detonated. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says this device was far from the biggest type of bomb dropped by the Allies or used in Soviet artillery, but it could have caused serious damage within a few hundred metres had it exploded. Last year, a bomb was detonated on site in Munich. Even with a wide area evacuated, a large and spectacular explosion caused a fire and much damage to houses.","Trains in Berlin were stopped or diverted for hours after the discovery of an unexploded World War II bomb near the city's main railway station, affecting thousands of commuters."
"Katya AdlerEurope editor@BBCkatyaadleron Twitter In fact, it's a mere formality. Ahead of the summit, Mr Cameron has spoken to other EU leaders individually about his reform agenda. He will need them on board if, as promised, he'll settle for nothing less than fundamental changes in the EU ahead of Britain holding an in/out referendum by the end of 2017. So what is David Cameron asking for? In broad brush strokes he wants: Don't expect much more detail than that out of this summit. The prime minister is careful not to give too much away in public. After all, this is a process of negotiation in Europe and of persuasion at home to convince eurosceptics that any deal he eventually gets was hard won and significant. And what kind of reception can he expect from other EU leaders? In Britain, discussion about Europe can frequently smack of ""us and them"" sentiment but watch and listen to David Cameron following his election victory last month. He literally oozes relaxed confidence. In general. EU reform is no exception. And he is not wrong, for now. Mainland Europeans, accustomed to laborious consensus politics (such as in Germany) or political theatre that's high in drama and all too often thin on results (like Italy) speak admiringly or even in awe about the UK and its combative parliament and no-nonsense way of getting things said and done. And David Cameron has just provided another stark example of this. Complaining about the EU is commonplace across its member countries these days. But the prime minister has simply declared ""we want a different relationship with a reformed EU, otherwise we'll take a vote on whether to leave"". As we've travelled across Europe over the past few weeks and months, we've met a number of politicians - in Spain for example - who've expressed some exasperation at Mr Cameron calling an EU referendum. But my sneaking suspicion is that it's because those same politicians know their electorate want a better deal from the EU too. There's a fear that if every country pushes for themselves, that could, potentially, lead to the unravelling of the European Union. Germany calls it Pandora's Box. The Spanish expression is Opening the Melon. French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron blames Margaret Thatcher and her special EU deal, the rebate, for - as he put it - destroying the EU budget. ""I've seen it myself at these meetings,"" he said. ""Now everyone wants their own cheque."" He used a very determined tone when he insisted that Britain could not be allowed to ""cherry pick"". I've mentioned this here on the blog before, but I'll repeat it because it is so memorable, that the Germans call this stance ""Extrawurst"" or extra sausage. Using a fabulous British expression now - David Cameron really has put the cat amongst the pigeons. But rather than alienating or isolating the UK, many EU leaders are - and let me emphasise that this is before negotiations begin and potentially get dirty - lining up to say how much they want Britain to stay in the EU. Now if I were cynical, I could say a lot of that has to do with the fear of losing one of the largest net contributors to the EU budget, one of only two decent sized and active military forces in the EU, with a permanent seat on the UN National Security Council, a pretty good relationship with the United States and a determination to stand up to Russia. There is also genuine and widespread support amongst leaders for the prime minister's drive to make the EU more competitive, with a stronger single market and less bureaucracy. But European smiles disappear when it comes to David Cameron's push to curb internal EU migration. He wants to put other EU members off coming to live and work in Britain by cutting their benefits. Poland is furious. Hundreds of thousands of its countrymen and women live in Britain. Jacek Rostowski, Poland's former finance minister and chief adviser to the Polish prime minister until the recent political upheaval there, told me: ""You can't discriminate between EU citizens in competition for jobs, just as you can't discriminate between EU citizens on EU territory in access to health services. ""Imagine if British people who retire in France or Spain had differential access to French and Spanish health services. That gives you some idea of what would happen if the boot was on the other foot."" Germany objects too. MP Michael Fuchs told me Mr Cameron's proposal tramples on the Freedom of Movement - one of the EU's core principles. Spain's EU Minister, Inigo Mendez de Vigo, simply shook his head, insisting: ""There are certain values, certain principles we all share - well, we cannot touch them, we shouldn't touch them - and we're not going to do it."" So where do we go from here? His proposals formally submitted this evening during the summit, David Cameron hopes substantial negotiations and technical discussions can start in earnest. The European Commission will be charged with working out whether his ideas, if accepted by fellow EU leaders, would need treaty change or not. The prime minister admits the road ahead is a long one. Yet his chosen timetable - to be done and dusted with the deal and the referendum by the end of 2017, many predict even sooner - is very short indeed. In Brussels' terms, at least.","It'll be less of a fanfare and more a quick bugle blast but today, at a scheduled summit of EU leaders in Brussels, UK Prime Minister David Cameron will - for the first time - officially present the outlines of his reform proposals for the EU."
"Justin RowlattSouth Asia correspondent ""This is the worst job on Earth,"" he tells me. And it is true there are no shortage of tough issues facing Afghanistan. The most obvious is security. His country has been at war for almost 16 years now. Yet the Afghan president is surprisingly bullish about how long the country will continue to require the support of Nato. Nato troops, he says, will be able to pull out ""within four years"". Many military analysts will consider that optimistic given that it is only three years since the Nato combat mission ended and the Afghan military took responsibility for the battle against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. About 14,000 Nato troops remain in the country to ""train, advise and assist"" Afghan forces. The aim is to strengthen them so they can take the battle to the Taliban. Mr Ghani doesn't deny it has been a difficult three years. ""We were like 12-year-olds taking on the responsibility of a 30-year-old; but we really grew in the process. Now in terms of management and leadership things are really falling into place."" He continues: ""Within four years, we think our security forces would be able to do the constitutional thing, which is the claim of legitimate monopoly of power."" He expects that some foreign troops will remain in Afghanistan after that period as part of the global fight against terrorism but, when I ask whether he is saying Afghan forces have turned the corner in the fight against the Taliban, there is no hesitation: ""Yes,"" he says. The Taliban, he says, had two strategic aims: to overthrow the government or to create two ""political geographies"", by which he means whole areas of the country where it holds sway. ""It has failed miserably in both of these aims,"" Mr Ghani believes. Whether that is true is debatable. The latest figures from the US military show that the Afghan government controls less than two-thirds of the country. The rest is either controlled or contested by the Taliban and other militant groups. What is more, last year Afghanistan lost some 10% of its entire fighting force: about 7,000 Afghan National Army soldiers were killed, another 12,000 were injured, and many thousands more deserted. One reason the Afghan president is so confident is that he believes that the West does not really understand the real nature of the conflict. His government is not fighting a civil war, he argues, but a drug war. ""Taliban is the largest exporters of heroin to the world. Why is the world not focusing on heroin? Is this an ideological war or is this a drug war?"" asks Mr Ghani. ""This criminalisation of the economy needs to be addressed."" So what is the ultimate aim, I ask. ""A peace agreement with the Taliban,"" he answers without a breath. ""The whole aim of the strategy is to provide the ground for political solution and a political solution is a negotiated solution. It's imperative that the people are given a chance to live their lives. We have been denied breathing space for 40 years, and in an immense tribute to our people for their resilience, any other state would've been completely broken."" Corruption crackdown Mr Ghani is full of praise for US President Donald Trump, who finally announced last month that his government was ready to stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. Withdrawal, said Mr Trump, would be determined by ""conditions on the ground and not arbitrary timetables"". The US president also said he would send a few thousand more troops to support the current Nato mission. In return, Mr Ghani says he plans a complete overhaul of the Afghan government, including redoubled efforts to crack down on corruption. ""The first principle of tackling corruption,"" he tells me, ""is that you do not engage in it and you have the will to confront it. Whoever engages in corruption, regardless of affiliation, relationship etc, must be subject to the same law."" ""A three-star general that I have promoted is now in prison because it was demonstrated that fuel was being stolen,"" he boasts. ""One of the richest men in the country that people thought was untouchable is now in prison. You can ask anyone in the judiciary, I provide full political support."" The Afghan president's message is clear: ""Self-reliance is not just words, but deeds."" And, with two years to go before a general election, he says he doesn't care if the price of his reform efforts is his presidency. ""If election is your goal, you're never going to engage in reform. Reform has to be your goal. Election is the means. You run for office in order to do something, not in order to perpetuate yourself. Politicians have become extraordinarily conservative, but our times require imagination and bold action.""",President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan makes no bones about the challenges facing his country when we sit down for an exclusive BBC interview in his palace in Kabul.

"Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was a ""rotten measure"" but necessary. The existing limit of up to 130km/h will still be permitted at night. The new limit is set to come in next year along with several other measures. Ministers have been grappling with ways of responding to the emissions problem. ""No-one likes this,"" Mr Rutte told a news conference. ""But there's really something bigger at stake. We have to stop the Netherlands from coming to a halt and jobs being lost unnecessarily."" He said it was the deepest crisis he had ever dealt with in nine years in power and the refugee crisis in 2015-16 bore no comparison. Why are they acting now? The crisis is so severe that big infrastructure projects have been put on hold. A ruling in May by the top court in the Netherlands on nitrogen oxide emissions affected thousands of plans for roads, housing and airports. The Council of State said Dutch rules for granting building and farming permits breached EU law protecting nature from emissions such as ammonia and nitrous oxide. The government wants to build 75,000 homes next year, so for the past week the cabinet has tried to find a solution to cutting the pollutants. Among the options discussed by ministers was a ban on vehicles on Sunday. Drivers will be allowed to revert to the current maximum between 19:00 and 06:00. Only 8%-10% of cars are thought to travel between those times. Even with the lower 100km/h speed limit there could still be emissions problems in areas such as the congested Randstad central-west belt, home to the biggest Dutch cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Bringing the motorway speed limit down to 100km/h will make the Netherlands the lowest in Europe, on a par with Cyprus which has far fewer motorways. The most common maximum speed limit in Europe is 130km/h while in the UK it is 70mph (112 km/h). Although the Dutch measure is being seen as temporary, Mr Rutte said he would not make any promises on limiting it. While ministers want to introduce the reduced speed limit soon, it will have to be co-ordinated and road signs changed. Why farmers will be affected too Last month, farmers reacted angrily to claims that intensive farming was partly to blame for the emissions problem, after a report called for drastic measures to reduce livestock as well as action on the roads. A tractor protest caused the worst-ever morning rush hour in the country as farmers argued they were being victimised. Another of the measures announced on Wednesday is a plan to change livestock feed to include an enzyme that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions from cows. Farmers are also set to be affected by plans next month to cut emissions in protected areas of the country that are part of a European network known as Natura 2000. A project to bring the Formula 1 Grand Prix back to Zandvoort next year was criticised by some environmentalists, who raised concerns about emissions from the race as well as from work to extend the circuit.","The daytime speed limit on Dutch roads is to be cut to 100km/h (62mph) in a bid to tackle a nitrogen oxide pollution crisis, according to cabinet sources widely quoted by Dutch media."
"The firm said a ""clerical error"" meant Guernsey States, who are responsible for the airfield, were overcharged. Alderney Electricity chairman Mike Richards apologised and said the bill for the States was charged monthly but was duplicated each quarter. He said the problem came to light in mid-May after new management reporting systems were set up. Mr Richards said the company had carried out an internal inquiry to find out how the error arose. He said he had discussed with Guernsey's Treasury and Resources Department about how to repay the money. Mr Richards said: ""It is an historic situation which arose from a clerical error made before any of the current board or employees were in post.

"Funerals are incongruous events - an act of both separation from one we loved and solidarity with those left behind. Unloading the burden of loss is only seemingly possible by sharing it with others. There are more than six million Algerians dispersed across the Mediterranean region and in pockets across North America. For those of us from the diaspora, it is not uncommon to miss the funeral services of our loved ones. In Algeria, the custom is to promptly bury the deceased. Burial rites are usually completed by the next day's Asr (or mid-afternoon) prayer, so they are virtually impossible to attend from other continents. When my maternal grandmother passed away, for example, my mother flew in from Canada, but arrived two days after her mother was laid to rest in the family cemetery. Although she could not properly mourn, my mother stressed the importance of being able to help host the overwhelming waves of guests that rolled in for couscous and coffee. After leaving Canada five years ago and moving to Algeria to pursue a career in football journalism, I slowly grew into the role of logistics officer, especially during family tragedies. It is a duty I take pride in, despite the petty procedural difficulties. On 17 March last year, when Covid-19 cases began sky-rocketing in Algeria, the government decided to close land, sea and air borders. Many countries temporarily employed similar methods, but Algeria remains one of a handful of African nations that is yet to re-open commercial travel to its own citizens. I remember hoping, at the time, that neither of my two elderly grandparents would contract the virus. My paternal grandmother was 85 years of age and my paternal grandfather was 92. They both suffered from hypertension and my grandfather was diabetic. Growing up in Canada, I had always shared an awkward relationship with my grandfather. He was well-dressed, sophisticated and enjoyed listening to the traditional Andalusian malouf music of Mohamed Tahar Fergani. Our one area of common interest was football. He was a pioneer in the game — one of Algeria's first international referees. He officiated some of Africa's first World Cup qualifying matches, the third-fourth-place match of the 1965 Africa Cup of Nations, as well as some of the biggest domestic fixtures in early Algerian footballing history. So in the summer months when he would fly to Canada, or we would visit Algeria, both of us could sit in front of the television for hours and muse over dribbles, goals and assists. 'Could be bad' In mid-August, I received a WhatsApp message from my mother, informing me that both of my grandparents were sick and that both were exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms. ""It could be bad,"" she wrote. After checking in on them, I began to mentally prepare myself to act as a liaison between Canada and eastern Algeria, where my family is from. But it slowly dawned on me that, this time, my services would not be needed. My grandfather, Mohamed Mezahi, passed away on Friday, 20 August. The following day, his PCR test came back Covid-positive. I called my father to tell him I was sorry. He seemed lucid when responding: ""I am going to take time off work and book a flight, can you drive me to Constantine?"" I agreed, but insisted he made sure travel was possible. He booked a flight with a European airline online, only for it to be cancelled the very same evening. He was offered a voucher instead. My father immediately tried booking for three days later. Again, on the eve of the flight, the airline informed him that his flight was cancelled. His final attempt was for three weeks later, but I could tell that this time it was an empty gesture. My grandfather was already buried in a downtown Constantine cemetery adjacent to my great-grandmother and great-uncle. Sure enough, the final flight reservation was cancelled and a voucher offered instead. ""It's tough,"" I told him, ""but all Algerians abroad are going through exactly the same thing."" ""I hope the decision-makers have a clear conscience,"" he replied. My grandmother, thankfully, recovered. As of now, approximately 3,000 Algerians in Algeria have died from coronavirus, according to official statistics. That is at least 3,000 funeral services where Algerians in the diaspora have not been able to unload the burden of loss by sharing it with loved ones.

"""Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs,"" he told reporters. He said the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were ""repugnant"" to everything Americans held dear. Mr Trump was criticised for not specifically denouncing extremists in his initial comments on the violence. Heather Heyer, 32, died and 19 others were hurt when a car rammed into people protesting against a far-right march. James Alex Fields, 20, was formally charged on Monday with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was also denied bail during his appearance in court via video from jail. He is said to have harboured Nazi sympathies. The justice department is opening a civil rights investigation into the incident. 'Egregious display' On Monday, Mr Trump arrived back at the White House from his golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, to issue a comprehensive condemnation. ""We condemn this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence,"" he said. ""It has no place in America."" ""Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,"" He paid tribute to Ms Heyer as well as two police officers killed in a helicopter crash after helping to tackle the unrest. Ms Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, thanked the president for his ""words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred"". She told NBC News in a statement she also sent her condolences for the families of the two state troopers who were injured. But some felt Mr Trump's comments came too late. Civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton criticised Mr Trump for waiting 48 hours before issuing a full condemnation. ""We had the head of state of Germany speak before we had the president of this country,"" he told MSNBC. ""His silence spoke volumes to people. It was too little, too late."" A fire of Trump's own making Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Monday afternoon Donald Trump tried to put out yet another fire of his own making. The president prefaced his explicit condemnation of the KKK, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists with the words ""as I said on Saturday"" - but the problem was he had said nothing of the sort. In the hours after the violence in Charlottesville, Mr Trump had offered a broad condemnation of ""many sides"" - and caught hell for it from liberals and members of his own party, who felt compelled to break ranks with their leader. Two days later, the president was in front of cameras again, with words that should have been easy - and obvious to most in a nation that expects its presidents to be comfortable condemning racist extremism. Even on Monday, however, the president's strong words were undermined somewhat by his off-topic introductory boasts of the nation's economic strength and the fact that his obviously carefully crafted statement was read off teleprompters - a practice for which candidate Trump regularly mocked Barack Obama. After finishing his remarks, the president quickly exited the room, as reporters asked why he had not spoken sooner. The president did not answer, but such questions will follow him in the days ahead. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said earlier that the deadly violence in Charlottesville met ""the definition of domestic terrorism"" - a phrase which Mr Trump declined to use to describe the events. Mr Sessions announced on Saturday the Justice Department had opened a federal civil rights investigation into the deadly incident. Hundreds of white nationalists had convened in Charlottesville to protest against the removal of a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. They were challenged by anti-fascist and counter-protesters and the rally erupted into violent clashes. Shortly after, Ms Heyer and several others who were leaving the area were struck by the car. Protests and vigils in solidarity with the victims were held in many US cities on Sunday. In Seattle, police used pepper spray to stop protesters approaching a pro-Trump rally. Among those to criticise Mr Trump was Ken Frazier, CEO of drugs giant Merck, who announced on Monday he would resign from the president's American Manufacturing Council. Mr Frazier, who is African American, tweeted that he had ""a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism"". John Kerry, who was US secretary of state under Barack Obama, said that Mr Trump's initial reaction to the death in Virginia had been more telling. ""No matter what @potus says now-first instincts always revealing; his was to look into the camera and say 'many sides' - that cant be erased,"" he wrote in a tweet.","US President Donald Trump has spoken out against racist violence after the killing of a protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday."

"By John SimpsonBBC World affairs editor It was a celebration of their new independence - kite-flying, like singing, whistling, showing any skin above the ankle or possessing photos or drawings of human beings, was a crime punishable by savage beating. The Taliban government of 1996-2001 was the most extreme form of government I have ever seen. And the most absurd - the man who often cut the hands and feet off convicted thieves was the minister of health. When the Taliban were chased out of the towns and cities of Afghanistan with Western help, I assumed that they would never be back. It never occurred to me that the United States and Britain would, only a year later, be planning an all-out invasion of a different country, Iraq; or that the money that might have lifted Afghanistan out of its wretched poverty might be spent on overthrowing Saddam Hussein. 'More sophisticated' In the years between 2001 and 2005, with scarcely anyone in the West noticing, the Taliban started to come back. British and American diplomats based here often used to tear their hair out in private when they realised what was happening. And it got worse. In April 2006 the then Defence Secretary, John Reid, now Lord Reid, was quoted by Reuters as saying that British troops were in Afghanistan to help the people reconstruct their country, and would be perfectly happy to leave in three years' time without firing a single shot. It was used against him later, but that is indeed how things seemed in 2006. Then the situation started turning nasty - and once again because of events in Iraq. The Americans were heavily critical of the relatively relaxed way British troops were controlling the southern Iraqi city of Basra. They wanted tougher tactics, more aggression, and eventually the British left Iraq to the Americans altogether, and concentrated on Afghanistan instead. But the British approach changed. Instead of concentrating on reconstruction, the British forces found themselves increasingly fighting a shooting war. It's hard to avoid the feeling that, having been criticised by the Americans for being too soft in Iraq, Britain wanted to show that it could indeed fight and win wars still. At first, it did not seem such a bad idea - up to that point the Taliban had mostly been pretty ineffectual fighters. But they slowly got better - much better. Volunteers from other countries started to come in, just as they once had into Iraq. The bomb-makers became extraordinarily sophisticated. And now the Americans and British have set the end of 2014 as the time for pulling out. The Taliban, naturally encouraged, have changed their tactics. Their plan is to show they can strike in the heart of Kabul itself. They have recently attacked Nato headquarters and the US embassy, and probably murdered the former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was acting as chief peace negotiator. The general unpopularity of the killing may be the reason the Taliban have not publicly admitted responsibility. Outside Kabul itself, the Taliban are in control of big areas close by. A couple of years ago I filmed at a girls' school in Logar province which had just been blown up by the Taliban. Then it caused a shock that they had come so close to the capital. Nowadays that area is too dangerous for Westerners to visit. So, 10 years later, are the Taliban on their way back? Will they once again take over Kabul and start whipping children for whistling or flying kites? 'Diverted efforts' I find it really hard to believe - as long as the Western countries don't forget about Afghanistan yet again, as they did when the Russians left in 1989, and once more when the Taliban were chased out in 2001. The pull-out of British and American troops may actually help, since the Taliban will not be able to say they are fighting foreign invaders any more. But I admit I thought they would never be back 10 years ago, and I was very wrong then. Like the British and American governments, I forgot the old adage - you can invade Afghanistan, but you must never occupy it. One thought still haunts me, though. Supposing that, instead of switching their attention to Iraq after 2001, the British and the Americans had devoted all their efforts to making this, one of the world's poorest countries, a thriving, prosperous, educated society? The war is said to have cost the Americans $120bn, and the British £18bn. Just think how, if that money had been judiciously and wisely invested here, it might have transformed everything.

"About 7.2km (4.5 miles) of track are reported to have been affected by subsidence exceeding safety limits. The line suffered an embarrassing embankment collapse last week. The building contractor, however, insists the problem is normal as it was discovered during pre-launch check-ups. The line was set to open in May. Photos in Chinese newspapers have shown workers removing rails and sleepers from the scene of the embankment collapse in Qianjiang city. The railway company which owns the line has estimated that repairs will take up to a month, several state media reports said on Wednesday. One local government railway official said it was too early to say what caused the subsidence problem. China has embarked on an ambitious project to expand its high-speed rail network across the country. The collapsed embankment is part of the Hanyi High Speed Railway, which links the provincial capital Wuhan with Yichang to the west. China plans to launch nine new high-speed railway lines this year, bringing the total length of the network to more than 10,000km (6,250 miles). The Hanyi line problems are just the latest incident to tarnish the reputation of the new network. Forty people died last summer in a crash on a rapid train line in eastern Zhejiang province and the entire high speed scheme has been dogged with reports of corruption.","More problems have been found on a stretch of newly built high-speed railway line in China's Hubei province, media reports say."
"Speaking in Indonesia during her tour of the region, Mrs Clinton said the Asean bloc and China must make ""meaningful progress"" towards drafting a code of conduct for the disputes. China has competing territorial claims against four Asean member states. The rows have led to increased tensions in the region and fears of conflict. At a news conference with her Indonesian counterpart in the capital, Jakarta, Mrs Clinton said the US did not take a position on territorial disputes. ""But we believe the nations of the region should work collaboratively to resolve disputes without coercion, without intimidation and certainly without the use of force,"" she said. ""That is why we encourage Asean and China to make meaningful progress toward finalising a comprehensive code of conduct in order to establish rules of the road and clear procedures for peacefully addressing disagreements."" Indonesia has played a leading role in drafting the code of conduct, which China has so far been reluctant to sign up to, preferring to negotiate with individual countries. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa agreed with Mrs Clinton on the need for the code, saying that without it, ""we can be certain of more incidents and tension for our region"". US 'at fault' Mrs Clinton flew in to Indonesia from the Cook Islands, where she attended a Pacific summit. She will later meet Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. She is also scheduled to visit China, East Timor and Brunei before heading to the Apec forum in Russia. Her extended visit is being seen as a sign that the US is stepping up its diplomatic offensive in the region, as part of President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" in the face of an assertive China. China has overlapping claims with four Asean members in the South China Sea. Earlier this year, vessels from China and the Philippines faced off for several weeks over one area, the Scarborough Shoal. At a regular meeting hosted by Cambodia in July, Asean failed for the first time in its 45-year history to issue a joint statement because of tensions over the disputes. Vietnam and the Philippines have accused host Cambodia of yielding to Chinese pressure to keep the issue off the agenda. Since then, Mr Natalegawa has visited regional leaders in a bid to encourage co-operation and the implementation of a joint code of conduct for all parties who claim the various islands. Mrs Clinton flies to China after Indonesia for two days of talks. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is also due in China later this month. On Monday a commentary by China's state-run Xinhua news agency said the US needed to prove it was ""returning to Asia as a peacemaker, instead of a troublemaker"". The security situation in the region was worsening, it said, because South China Sea and East China Sea territorial disputes were escalating. ""Washington, which claims not to take sides in the disputes, is partly blamed for fuelling the tensions because it has apparently emboldened certain relevant parties to make provocations against China in order to achieve undeserved territorial gains,"" the commentary said.",US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has urged South East Asian nations to work together to resolve territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
"By Robin Levinson-KingBBC News, Toronto The UN has cautioned that the high rate of unemployment among young adults could mean ""a lot of young people are going to be left behind"". In the US, about a quarter of people between 16-25 were unemployed in May - which was about double the unemployment rate of other age groups. It's a myth that all young adults are supported by their parents, or only work part time. According to Statistics Canada, of the roughly 500,000 people between the ages of 15-24 who lost their jobs in April, about half were working full-time. Young women and minorities are particularly vulnerable, according to a report by the Brookings Institution.

With music there's probably nothing that will make money until January, and I just have to accept that. How are you getting by? Before the pandemic, I was making at least twice as much money a month but my income varied. Now I know exactly how much money I'm going to have a month because I receive the government coronavirus stipend, and I can budget. I'm really afraid for September though, when my student loans will start up again (they were paused because of coronavirus). How's the job search going? There's no guarantee of any work next year at the Canadian Opera Company (COC). And they cancelled the fall - two out of six shows that season - with the possibility of the whole next season not happening. I'm kind of nervous to go back to restaurants right now because I think I'm not going to be able to find a job until they open inside, and then it's working inside with lots of exposure to people. What are your fears for the future? My main goal is music. So the restaurant, while I'm sad I've lost out of that income stream, I'm not overly concerned. But with music, that industry could be permanently affected. My biggest fear is probably arts organisations shutting down permanently. I just worry that culture in Canada is going to be not supported. I literally just graduated from my master's a year ago. I was getting jobs - I got the chorus job (at the COC) and I spent last summer in Italy singing. Now I'm doing nothing. How does your age affect your situation? There's so much less job security, but because I've basically grown up in that I'm not surprised. I'm used to having to look for odd jobs like babysitting, or going to paint somebody's wall. It doesn't feel totally crazy. I've never had a full time job with benefits available to me. Name: Zainab Mehdi Age: 22 Location: Toronto, Ontario Previous occupation: Recent graduate from McGill University with a BA in Psychology What were you planning to do this summer? This summer my plan was to stay in Montreal and research for a bit, because I was working for a behavioural neuroscience lab and we were working on a paper that was supposed to be sent for publishing in the next few months. McGill shut down on 13 March and the labs haven't really opened since. How are you getting by? I have been receiving the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) since May. It is only given for 16 weeks so my final month would be August. How have your plans changed? My lease was going to finish so I couldn't really stay in Montreal anymore. My family is in Pakistan so I'm staying with my friend in Toronto in her family home. I've switched over to look for more jobs in the business sector, under project management or market research. Academic research wasn't really an option, in the subject I was interested in, because it wasn't really essential. How is your job search going? I wouldn't say it's going well. The roles I'm looking for are entry level, there aren't many roles available and even when I do apply to applications they usually just say 'thanks for applying, but we're not going to proceed any further'. I've been trying to fill my time with learning some hard skills. I've been taking a course, and I've been interning for a construction company in project management, but it's part time. How has it been emotionally? I had to get used to the uncertainty. Any short-term goal or long-term goal just went out the window. So there was a lot of anxiety and stress there. There was a whole new world I didn't even understand that I was going into, and nobody else even understood it. I had to get used to the fact that I shouldn't have expectations anymore. When I did eventually get through that, it became easier. I tried making the most of the small things I was doing and recognising that I am doing a lot. It's not comparable to the pace I was doing before, but I can't really compare because it's not the same world. At the same time that you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty, you're still receiving news about a lot of loss. People are dying, there's so much grief. Name: Maxime Barret Age: 24 Location: Washington, DC Previous occupation: Stationary engineer, specialising in maintaining and repairing boilers and HVAC equipment, at a large hotel What are you doing now? I'm still currently employed but we got notice that the hotel may close as of 24 August. We were told when this whole thing started, we would be cut down to 32 hours. Then we were told the hotel would be closing down, and there would be a skeleton crew running the hotel. I was fortunate enough to be a part of that skeleton crew. But in June, we were told the hotel is closing and we all had to find new jobs. Now I don't know whether I should be looking for another job or not. How was it getting that news? I've been in that job for five years. It's the kind of job everyone puts their heart and soul into. Everyone felt like family there. It just kind of hurts getting a notice saying you don't have a job anymore. When I did trade school, I did an apprenticeship at that hotel. It was a four-year apprenticeship where you went to school at night and you learn on the job. That was really where I cut my teeth and learned the trade, which made it especially hard to leave it. How's your job search going? The job market is definitely not great. The hotel chain has a hiring freeze so it's hard finding a job moving from one hotel to the next, which means I lose all my benefits. I've applied to at least 30 jobs. I've probably had about six interviews, and I haven't heard back from many of them. It's been pretty tough. Before I was trying to apply for something that looked like a better job to go to, but now I'm just looking for whatever I can take. Running out of health insurance in a pandemic is not what you want to do. I am in a union - the union has really great insurance, but you have to find a job within the same union. But even the union gave is the advice of just take whatever you can get right now. How does your age affect your situation? It's good in some ways because in the blue-collar trades there's not a lot of young people. But in another sense, it's hard when you have everyone who's 20 years my senior with a lot more experience than me. Or managers who a lot of times look down on younger years, thinking if you don't have 30 years in the trade you don't know anything. Name: Katherine Fiallos Age: 22 Location: Montreal, Quebec Previous occupation: Recent graduate from McGill University with a BS in Microbiology and Immunology How's your job search going? I got an internship in Montreal just before the pandemic hit in global health, but it's just for this summer. For the long-term, I'm mostly looking for jobs in San Francisco, where I'm from, and Canada, where I went to school. I've applied to about 120-150 jobs online. About seven jobs postings were cancelled, which means they're no longer hiring, and I've gotten two interviews so far. The rest have just not gotten back to me. San Francisco is a hub of a lot of jobs and opportunities. You're used to people telling you to ""come to San Francisco, there's all these tech and bio-tech companies"" but going through the job-hunting process at this time, you can really feel the change in the economy. What does that feel like? It's frustrating. Once you start to go through months without hearing responses, you kind of feel like you're just not good enough. Even after all the efforts you've done, like getting internships and going through the four years of gruelling academic work, you just kind of feel like it's a waste. You have to tell yourself that it's not really you, it's part of the process - but it can really get to you. How are you getting by? I'm getting by with the money that my parents generously gave me to get through my last year of university and the summer while I do my internship in Montreal. I did get grant money for my summer research project which would be barely enough to pay for my rent and living expenses. Being honest, if my parents wouldn't have helped me out financially, I would probably be more stressed about my finances and about just living in general without a job. How has the pandemic changed your goals? The pandemic reminded me of the importance of public health. It was something I had considered briefly, but after the pandemic happened, I realised it's something really important and something I would want to get into. How does your age affect your situation? I never looked for a job before a pandemic, so it's hard for me to compare. In a way it is an advantage because young people are more sought out. If you're a young person with a bit of experience then it's probably more of an advantage, as opposed to a young person that has just graduated and needs to be trained, which is something companies are not always willing to do.","Young people are disproportionately affected by the economic impacts of coronavirus, several reports have found."
"More than 70 people were injured in the blaze, which broke out in the middle of the night destroying many properties. Gikomba is one of the largest open-air markets in the city and fires there are frequent, leading to speculation about possible arson attacks, The Standard newspaper says. However, the cause of the current fire is not yet known. The St John Ambulance service said the fire broke out at 02:30 local time (23:30 GMT on Wednesday) and spread to apartments and market stalls before being contained after about 90 minutes. Some of the victims were burned while others inhaled poisonous fumes as they tried to salvage their property. Hospital officials said there were four children among the dead. Pictures from Reuters news agency showed people searching the wreckage and ash. The injured have been rushed to different hospitals across the city. One woman told the BBC she is still searching for her sister. ""When I got to the scene, the fire had already spread to her house,"" said Millicent Achieng. ""She told me she was inside her flat and there was so much smoke that she couldn't move. Her child was with her."" Ms Achieng said she pleaded with the security guard to open the gate to building, but he refused - saying he had been instructed by the landlord to lock it to ""keep looters out"". Ms Achieng said she tried to reach her sister unsuccessfully by phone several more times. ""Now calls aren't going through,"" she said. ""At dawn I asked my brother to go look for her in the hospitals but he couldn't find her. We don't know if my sister is among those who were burned beyond recognition."" More about Kenya: The market is well known for the sale of second-hand clothes, shoes and vegetables, and also has timber yards which were damaged in the blaze. The blaze is believed to have broken out in one of the timber yards.",At least 15 people have been killed in a fire at a market in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
"9th century - Founding of Kievan Rus, the first major East Slavic state. The traditional account, a matter of debate among historians, attributes its founding to the semi-legendary Viking (or Varangian) leader Oleg, ruler of Novgorod, who went on to seize Kiev, which owing to its strategic location on the Dnieper River, became the capital of Kievan Rus. 10th century - Rurik dynasty established and the rule of Prince Vladimir the Great (Prince Volodymyr in Ukrainian) heralds start of a golden age. In 988 Vladimir accepts Orthodox Christianity and begins conversion of Kievan Rus to the Byzantine rite, thus setting the course for Christianity in the east. 11th century - Kievan Rus reaches its peak under Yaroslav the Wise (grand prince 1019-1054), with Kiev becoming eastern Europe's chief political and cultural centre.

"Ramush Haradinaj, 48, served as a rebel commander in the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, which eventually led to Kosovo declaring independence. He twice faced war crimes charges at the UN, but was acquitted both times. Kosovo's foreign ministry said his arrest was unacceptable, and that it was working to secure his release. But Serbia said it would seek his extradition. Mr Haradinaj, now an opposition leader in Kosovo, was arrested by police at Basel Mulhouse Freiburg airport, close to the Swiss and German borders in eastern France. He was due to appear at a court in Colmar on Thursday. Authorities said they were acting on an arrest warrant from Serbia, apparently dating back to 2004. French sources told Reuters news agency they would consider whether there were grounds not to act on the extradition request, particularly if it had been made for political reasons. Serbian Prime Minister Alexander Vucic said on Thursday that there were numerous incriminating pieces of evidence against Mr Haradinaj and he hoped France would put justice ahead of politics. The former rebel leader was briefly detained by Slovenian police in 2015 but soon released. He was a commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army during the 1990s conflict, and Serbia alleges he oversaw a campaign of torture and murder against ethnic Serbs. He has consistently denied the allegations, and stepped down as prime minister after just 100 days to face the charges.

"Anthony and Morag Jordan, assistant house parents at the home, were jailed in 2011 for their part in the children's abuse. The panel heard Morag Jordan was a ""cold woman"" and would hit the children with her hand. Anthony Jordan also hit children with a metal spoon, a knife, or with his hand. 'Being cheeky' Giving evidence, one victim said Mr Jordan would hit him for different reasons, ranging from leaving the table without asking to being cheeky. Morag Jordan was given a nine-month term in 2011 for assault in the 1970s and 1980s. Her husband, Anthony Jordan, was sentenced to six months for eight charges involving two boys. Patrick Sadd, counsel to the inquiry, said Mrs Jordan would regularly strike three girls on her head or face with her hand. Some of the work references put forward for her at the home were also read to the inquiry. The panel heard she was employed as a nursery nurse at Haut de la Garenne in 1970. She was described in one reference as having ""a delightful personality and a sense of humour"" while another said she had ""patience and adaptability as well as an easy, friendly approach to children."" The Independent Jersey Care Inquiry is investigating child abuse in Jersey's care system since 1945. It is focusing on, but not restricted to, the Haut de la Garenne care home during the 1960s.

"The magazine Wprost is already at the centre of another scandal over leaked tapes involving the Polish government. It has also published remarks allegedly made by Mr Sikorski in which he criticised UK Prime Minister David Cameron's handling of EU affairs. He has not denied using such language. But Poland's foreign ministry has said the remarks have been taken out of context. Mr Sikorski and PM Donald Tusk have accused an ""organised crime group"" of being behind the revelations. Earlier this month Mr Sikorski, a conservative and leading critic of Russia in the current Ukraine crisis, was nominated by the Polish government to replace Catherine Ashton as EU foreign policy chief. Baroness Ashton, known as the EU high representative, will step down in November, but EU leaders have not yet decided who will replace her. According to the excerpts, Mr Sikorski told former Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski at a restaurant in Warsaw early this year that ""the Polish-US alliance isn't worth anything"". Using vulgar language, he compared Polish subservience to the US to giving oral sex. He also warned that such a stance would cause ""conflict with the Germans, Russians"". He also used a racially loaded term to describe the Polish stance - ""murzynskosc"", which suggests a slave mentality. ""[We are] suckers, total suckers. The problem in Poland is that we have shallow pride and low self-esteem,'' Mr Sikorski was quoted as saying. Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski told reporters on Monday that the US was a ""very important ally and partner"". In further remarks, published by Wprost, the foreign minister goes on to talk about Mr Cameron's immigration policy: ""It's either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time, his incompetence in European affairs."" He goes on to say, using expletive-laden terms, that Mr Cameron messed up the 2011 EU fiscal compact on budget discipline, which the UK tried to block. ""Because he's not interested, because he doesn't get it, because he believes in this stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to manipulate the system,"" Mr Sikorski was quoted as saying. Although bugging of conversations to gain information is illegal in Poland, punishable by up to two years in jail, the series of leaks has hit the Polish government hard. Prosecutors were widely criticised when they ordered a late-night raid last Wednesday on the offices of Wprost, broadcast live on Polish TV, during which the magazine's editor refused to hand over his laptop. The following day, the prime minister said he might have to call snap elections. In the initial leak, Wprost published the content of an alleged private conversation in which Poland's top banker discussed the next election with a minister. Under Polish law, the central bank must remain independent of politics. In the recording, Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz was allegedly heard talking to Marek Belka, head of the National Bank of Poland. Mr Belka was apparently heard calling for ex-finance minister Rostowski to be removed in return for the bank's support in the event of an economic crisis.","Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has called his country's ties with the US ""worthless"", a Polish news magazine says, providing excerpts of a secretly recorded conversation."

"Mikhail Gorbachev, 85, has been having health problems. But his sense of humour is indestructible. When we meet he points to his walking stick. ""Look"", he says, ""now I need three legs to get around!"" Mr Gorbachev agreed to talk to me about the moment the world changed: the day the Soviet superpower fell apart. ""What happened to the USSR was my drama,"" he tells me. ""And a drama for everyone who lived in the Soviet Union."" 'It was a coup' On 21 December 1991, the evening news bulletin on Russian TV began with a dramatic announcement: ""Good evening. This is the news. The USSR no longer exists…"" A few days earlier, the leaders of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine had met to dissolve the Soviet Union and form a Commonwealth of Independent States. Now, eight other Soviet republics had decided to join them. Together they had defied Mikhail Gorbachev: the Soviet leader had been struggling to keep the republics together in a single state. ""Behind our backs there was treachery. Behind my back,"" Mr Gorbachev tells me. ""They were burning down the whole house just to light a cigarette. Just to get power. They couldn't get it through democratic means. So they committed a crime. It was a coup."" On 25 December 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev announced his resignation as Soviet president. At the Kremlin, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time. ""We were well on the way to a civil war and I wanted to avoid that,"" Mr Gorbachev recalls. ""A split in society and a struggle in a country like ours, overflowing with weapons, including nuclear ones, could have left so many people dead and caused such destruction. I could not let that happen just to cling on to power. Stepping down was my victory."" What about Putin? In his resignation speech, Mr Gorbachev claimed that, as a result of his perestroika reform programme, society ""had acquired freedom"". Twenty-five years on, I ask him whether he thinks that freedom is under threat in today's Russia. ""This process hasn't been completed,"" he replies. ""We need to speak frankly about this. There are some people for whom freedom is an annoyance. They don't feel good with it."" ""Do you mean Vladimir Putin?"" I ask. ""You'll have to guess who I mean,"" he replies. ""This is one question I'll leave you to answer."" In our conversation, Mikhail Gorbachev avoids direct criticism of Vladimir Putin. But he drops several hints that he and President Putin have their differences. ""Does Putin ever ask your advice?"" I ask. ""He knows everything already,"" replies Mr Gorbachev. ""Everybody likes to do things their own way. C'est la vie, as the French say."" Western 'provocation' The former Soviet president is scathing of modern Russia. ""Bureaucrats,"" he tells me, ""stole the nation's riches and began to create corporations"". He criticises one of President Putin's closest associates, Igor Sechin, head of the oil giant Rosneft, accusing him of trying to influence affairs of state. He attacks the West, too, accusing it of ""provoking Russia"". ""I'm sure that the Western press - and that includes you - has been given special instructions to discredit Putin and get rid of him. Not physically. Just to make sure he steps aside. But, as a result, his popularity rating here has reached 86%. Soon, it will be 120%!"" It was Mikhail Gorbachev's warm relationship with the late US President Ronald Reagan that paved the way for the end of the Cold War. So what does Mr Gorbachev think about the new man heading for the White House? Has he ever met Donald Trump? ""I've seen his high-rise buildings, but I haven't had the chance to meet him in person, so I cannot judge his views and policies,"" Mr Gorbachev tells me. ""But it's an interesting situation. In Russia everyone thought the Democrats would win - me included, although I didn't say it."" In the West, many people view Mikhail Gorbachev as a hero: as the man who gave freedom to Eastern Europe and allowed the reunification of Germany. But to many in his homeland, Mr Gorbachev is the leader who lost their empire. Mikhail Gorbachev - key dates: 1931 - Born in Privolye, a rural area in Stavropol, southern Russia 1955 - Graduates from Moscow State University law school, member of Communist Party (CP) 1970 - CP First Secretary in Stavropol 1980 - Full member of Soviet CP Politburo 1985 - Politburo elects him General Secretary of CP 1987-1989 - Pushes through far-reaching reforms, called ""glasnost"" (openness) and ""perestroika"" (restructuring) 1987 - Signs major nuclear disarmament treaty with US 1990 - Agrees to reunification of Germany after fall of Berlin Wall in 1989 1991 - Detained during abortive coup by Soviet hardliners in August, then resigns in December Soviet sing-along ""Do you accept any responsibility for the fall of the USSR?"" I ask him. ""What upsets me is that, in Russia, people don't sufficiently understand what I set out to achieve and what I actually did,"" he says. ""For the country, and for the world, perestroika opened the way to co-operation and peace. I'm only sorry I was unable to see it through to the end."" At the end of the interview, Mikhail Gorbachev and I move over to his piano. I play and Mr Gorbachev sings some of his favourite Soviet hits. These impromptu singsongs have become a curious but lovely tradition after a Gorbachev interview. The man who changed the world with perestroika loves to croon. ""Between the past and the future is the blink of an eye,"" he sings, ""and that instant is what we call life."" The Soviet Union passed in the blink of an eye. What are 70 years compared to the Roman or Ottoman empires? But I believe it is unfair to blame Mr Gorbachev - or the breakaway republics - for destroying the Soviet empire. The USSR may have been flawed from the start: economically, politically and ideologically. Perhaps this was fated to be a short-lived superpower.","Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has accused the West of ""provoking Russia"" and said the USSR collapsed in 1991 because of ""treachery"". The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow was given a rare interview with him, 25 years after the USSR's demise."
"The 56-year-old man was detained earlier this month in Yunnan province on suspicion of killing a teenager, Xinhua news agency reported. But police widened their investigation following reports of other missing teenagers in the area. Beijing says it has sent a team of experts to investigate. What started as a routine murder inquiry now appears could be the case of a serial killer, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. The case came to light after a 19-year-old man disappeared in late April in Yunnan province's Jincheng county. Xinhua said police discovered some of the teenager's personal belongings while searching the suspect's home. Reports then emerged of others teenagers who had gone missing in the same area. Villagers had thought the teenagers had been kidnapped to work in illegal brick kilns, the reports said. There are reports that some of the other victims may have been dismembered. Local media quoted residents as saying they had seen plastic bags at the suspect's home that appeared to contain bones.

"Chris Robertshaw said it was ""bonkers"" to continue ""doing the same thing year after year"". His comments were made as Tynwald unanimously approved an additional £8m for the island's health service. Staff recruitment issues, increased patient demand, and the rising cost of sending some people for treatment in the UK were blamed for the overspend. Health Minister David Ashford, who has been in post since January 2018, said that while he was taking action to ""mitigate"" the problem, the extra funding was ""essential"". The department was allocated £223m in the 2019 budget but is expected to spend more than £230m in 2019-2020. An amendment, tabled by Lawrie Hooper MHK, requiring the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to present ""its plans and timeline to bring staffing costs into line"" to parliament by June 2020, was approved. Mr Hooper said current finances were ""not adequate"" and the 2020-2021 budget had to be ""true reflection of the health department's needs"". Nearly £35m of additional funding has been spent during the last four years. Mr Ashford said the DHSC continued ""to develop initiatives to redress the budget imbalance"" and the recruitment of several consultants would help to save money in the forthcoming financial year. He added that the department would be able to ""refine the budget over time"" as it implemented the 26 recommendations made in a report compiled by Sir Jonathan Michael. The former NHS Foundation Trust chief was appointed by the Treasury in 2018, following the previous overspends, and his recommendations were unanimously backed by Tynwald in May last year.

"""I tried hard taking all my energy, but it took too much time to move in deep deep snow,"" Nobukazu Kuriki wrote on his Facebook page. ""I realised if I kept going, I wouldn't be able to come back alive,"" he wrote. He took the decision after attempting a final push to reach the 8,848m (29,029ft) summit. The 33-year-old was the first person to attempt the climb since Nepal's devastating earthquake in April. It was the fifth time he had tried to reach the summit in the past six years. Mr Kuriki wrote that he decided to abandon his attempt after leaving ""the final camp"" on Saturday evening. ""Thank you so much for all your support,"" he said. He was following the same route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay when they became the first people to reach the summit in 1953. Mr Kuriki prefers to climb in winter, alone and with minimal gear. ""This is the purest form of climbing and it is worth the extra danger,"" he said earlier. He has taken on Everest alone four times in the previous six years but has been forced to abandon the climb each time with the summit in view. In 2012, he lost all of his fingers and one thumb after spending two days in a snow hole at 8,230m in temperatures lower than -20C. His injuries present significant challenges in even the most basic climbing manoeuvres. ""I do feel nervous and afraid,"" he told Reuters shortly after arriving in Nepal a more than a month ago for acclimatising. ""This is only natural before attempting the challenge of climbing Everest, particularly after the earthquake and at this time of year."" Nepal's lucrative climbing industry was destroyed by the 25 April earthquake which killed more than 9,000 people and the avalanches that followed.",A Japanese mountaineer who had previously lost nine fingers to frostbite has abandoned his attempt to climb Mount Everest.
"Laxman Rao is not your ordinary chai wallah. Apart from the sweet milky tea his customers love, he also sells 24 Hindi-language titles he has authored. His open air tea shop, registered with the municipality, is essentially a few planks of wood perched on bricks, some buckets of water, ceramic and paper cups, kettles and a gas stove all neatly placed on the pavement. Born to a farmer in a village in the western state of Maharashtra, Mr Rao left for Delhi - the hub of major Hindi language publishers - in 1975 to fulfil his dream of becoming a writer. He worked as a construction worker, washed dishes at a restaurant and finally managed to open a shop to sell paan (betel leaves), beedi (hand-rolled cigarettes) and cigarettes a few yards away from his current tea stall. After a few years, he graduated to selling tea as it was more profitable. Mr Rao has a bachelor's degree in Hindi and has sat a masters exam through a distance learning programme. He worked hard to publish his books, but all his meetings with publishers ended in disappointment as nobody was willing to bet their money on a book written by a roadside vendor. Undeterred, he saved up enough to self-publish his first novel in 1979. ""Publishers have a highbrow attitude towards people like us and want money to publish our work. I had no money to spare and, therefore, decided to start my own publishing house,"" said Mr Rao. Turbulent lives, the struggle to rise above grinding poverty and the ordinary pleasures of life are the themes on which Mr Rao's novels, political essays and plays are based. And he is not without recognition. His best-selling novel ""Ramdas"" - published in 1992 - explores the complexities of the teacher-student relationship through the story of a young, wayward student from Mr Rao's village who drowned in a river. The book, now in its third edition, has sold more than 4,000 copies. In 1984, a senior Congress party member spoke to then prime minister Indira Gandhi about Mr Rao's books. Within a few days, he received an invitation to meet her and present his books to her. ""I met Mrs Gandhi in May 1984 with two of my books. She really appreciated my work and encouraged me to write more. I expressed my wish to write a book on her but she insisted that the book should be on her work rather than a commentary on her life. Enthused by this meeting, I wrote an essay on her tenure from 1969-1972 titled 'Pradhan Mantri' (Prime Minister) but she was shot dead before it could be published. After her death, I wrote a play based on her life and used the same title as the essay,"" Mr Rao said. Now, Mr Rao uses online selling platforms like Amazon and Flipkart to hawk his books. ""His books are doing very well on our site. We are happy that authors like Mr Rao have found a platform such as ours to sell his books,"" a spokesperson for Amazon India told the BBC. Hitesh, Mr Rao's elder son, manages online sales coordination and the author's Facebook page. But despite notching good sales figures on online sites, Mr Rao still cycles to various places to sell his books, a practice of many years. Outside his stall meanwhile, a light drizzle prompts customers to run for cover under the white fig tree that also shelters Mr Rao and his tea making apparatus. Unfazed by the shower, he removes the tarpaulin covering the utensils and stove and gets busy boiling water for tea. Loyal customers are huddled together under the tree waiting for a cuppa and fried snacks. On an average day, Mr Rao makes 1,200 rupees ($19; £12) by selling 150 cups of tea, enough to keep the kitchen fires in his two-room rented flat burning. The tea-selling author has won many awards and also received recognition from former president Pratibha Patil. However, he is yet to be invited to any literary festival in the country. ""Authors pull different stunts to market their books, make movies and TV serials out of them. I am a simple man. I get all my mail at this footpath address. My books are available in school, college and university libraries in the city and I am often asked to lecture in various schools and colleges across the country. What more can a writer ask for?"" said Mr Rao as he handed a cup of tea to a homeless woman waiting patiently by the stall.

"Lt-Gen Ben Hodges was speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme during large Nato exercises in north-western Poland. ""The Russians are able to move huge formations and lots of equipment a long distance very fast,"" he said. Nato needs to have that speed too, he said. ""Three days' notification, we ought to be able to do that,"" he said. More than 31,000 troops from 24 nations took part in Nato's Anaconda-16 exercises in Poland, from 7 to 17 June. The day after they ended, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned Nato against ""sabre-rattling and warmongering"", calling for exercises to be replaced with more dialogue and co-operation with Russia. ""Whoever believes that symbolic tank parades in Eastern Europe bring more security, is mistaken,"" he told Bild newspaper. Former Soviet bloc countries, now Nato members, were alarmed by Russia's rapid annexation of Crimea during the Ukraine crisis in March 2014. That operation caused the biggest chill in relations with Russia since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Russia's occupation of Georgian territory after a brief war in August 2008 also signalled a Russian readiness to intervene militarily in what it calls its ""neighbourhood"". Russian snap exercises Nato's strategy towards Russia will be high on the agenda of a Nato summit in Warsaw next month. Russia has held large military exercises near Ukraine's borders since the Crimea annexation and the uprising by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Nato has also complained of aggressive behaviour by Russian warplanes in the Baltic region. Russia, meanwhile, objects to Nato operating close to its borders, seeing the alliance as an aggressor. ""The thing I worry about the most is freedom of movement. Their snap exercises that they do, I personally am surprised each time they do it. And so you can see why that scares me,"" Gen Hodges said. Since 2007 Russia has been training its forces to conduct ""any sort of operation"" on its borders, he said. A future crisis would probably involve ""hybrid"" warfare, including ""a nasty cyber environment"", he added. Nato and Western leaders say there is clear evidence of Russia supplying heavy weapons and regular troops to the rebels who control a large swathe of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow denies that, but says some Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. Nato reinforcements Gen Hodges said Nato should create a ""military Schengen zone"", to give the 28-nation alliance freedom of movement. Schengen is the EU's passport-free zone which encompasses most EU member states. The general said it was ""concerning"" that Russia was able to deploy 20,000 troops and a lot of equipment ""on the border of a Nato country, or maybe somewhere like Georgia or Ukraine"". ""The Russians have what we call freedom of movement on the interior lines. They can move anywhere inside of Russia, as fast as they want."" Nato is beefing up its presence closer to Russia's borders. It plans to deploy a battalion to Poland and three more to the neighbouring Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - reaching a total of about 4,000 troops. The deployment will be rotational, yet Poland wants permanent Nato bases to be set up in the region. Gen Hodges said Nato was short of combat aircraft and short-range air defence in Eastern Europe. But he said Nato's deterrence was being bolstered by the US spending $3.4bn (£2.3bn) ""bringing equipment back into Europe"". ""I see it [Russia] as the only potential threat, that could destroy the United States, or the UK or Germany, or any other country. Because of their nuclear force. And they talk about nuclear weapons a lot,"" he said.",The commander of US troops in Europe says Nato cannot rapidly deploy large forces to Eastern Europe in the way that Russia can.
"The so-called yellow vests protests have seen thousands take to the streets across France over fuel prices. But Mr Macron struck a conciliatory tone, saying he was open to ideas and revising how the fuel tax was applied. He also announced that France would close all coal power stations by 2022, along with a number of nuclear plants. In his speech on Tuesday, Mr Macron said: ""I am not confusing the rioters with citizens who want to convey a message. ""I sympathise with my fellow citizens, but I will not give in to violence."" He said ""you cannot be pro-environment on Monday and then when Tuesday comes be against rising fuel prices"". But in a concession, he said the controversial tax could be adjusted when fuel prices soared to ease the burden on motorists. He pointed to decades of French policy encouraging citizens to move farther from cities and travel by road. ""We pushed them into this situation… they are the victims of this situation, they have not created it,"" he said. ""We should listen to the social alarm and protests, but there is also an environmental alarm."" He acknowledged that many citizens felt the policy was being imposed on them without consultation. After his speech, French broadcaster BFMTV reported that the ecology minister would meet with representatives from the yellow vests movement later on Tuesday. France is heavily dependent on nuclear power, which Mr Macron pledged to reduce to 50% of the national energy mix by 2035 by closing 14 of the country's 58 reactors. None, however, will be closed before 2022 with the exception of Fessenheim on the German border. That is on top of the closure of all four of France's remaining coal-fired power plants and investment of billions of euros into renewable energy. Mr Macron's approval rating has fallen steadily in recent months, with his deeply unpopular fuel tax increase adding to his political woes. The gilets jaunes rallies were originally about fuel tax increases. Protesters donned the yellow vest required to be carried in every vehicle by law and blocked roads, causing widespread traffic jams. But the protests have now spread to encompass rising anger at high taxes and living costs, and span the entire political spectrum - even the far right, which the government blamed for violence in Paris at the weekend. Those protests saw the famous Champs-Elysées packed with 5,000 people with thousands more spread across the rest of the capital. Tear gas and a water cannon were used to disperse crowds after barricades were erected on the capital's streets and a small number of protesters tried to break a security cordon. Most demonstrators have remained peaceful. But one person died during the protests when they were struck by a panicked driver. A few days later, a motorcyclist was also killed when they were hit by a van making a sudden turn in the traffic chaos. But Mr Macron is also facing opposition from the political class. On Tuesday, 12 of France's 13 regional leaders called on Mr Macron to reconsider the fuel tax. In the letter, published in French newspaper L'Opinion, the regional presidents called for a moratorium on the tax, writing that it would be a ""serious mistake"" to characterise the widespread protests as an extremist movement. Instead, they wrote, it was indicative of widespread anger of citizens forced to live further and further from their place of work and spend more on travel. The collected presidents also added that they were not against environmental taxes, but rather in favour of taking the time to improve the proposals. After his Tuesday speech, Mr Macron's political opponents decried what they described as a lack of action. Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said the president's words were ""devoid of any solutions"", and the only thing he had convinced her of was the need for change. Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the leftist France Unbowed group labelled the speech ""an hour of noise"" without any answers, while Socialist Olivier Faure wrote that the president ""says that he hears [the complaints], but does not understand"".","Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will not abandon a controversial fuel tax, as he set out France's future energy strategy."

Police have raided the offices of the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad. Staff at the agency were allegedly involved in selling fake certificates to buyers in nearby non-EU countries. Many of the false applications are believed to have come from states with sizeable ethnic Bulgarian minorities, including Moldova, Macedonia and Ukraine. Some reports suggest the agency was issuing about 30 dubious certificates a week. Prosecutors say they are investigating the agency's work on counts including bribe-taking, forgery and abuse of office.","Prosecutors in Bulgaria say they have smashed a passport scam which saw thousands fraudulently acquire Bulgarian citizenship - and with it, the right to travel and work throughout the European Union."
"It was built in the 1980s for the Iraqi military, in desert around 100 miles west of Baghdad. But after the US invasion in 2003, it became one of the biggest bases for American troops - and was quickly transformed. ""It's right in the middle of the desert, and surrounded on all sides by scrublands and desert and rocks,"" Oliver Poole reported for the BBC in 2006. ""As you emerge into the American section, you come across much better roads... in many ways they've tried to recreate the set-up of a modern US suburban town."" The facilities were so impressive, some US troops even called it ""Camp Cupcake"". As the US withdrew from the base in 2009 and 2010, it was handed back to the Iraqis. But, as the Islamic State group gained control of surrounding Anbar province, the base came under attack. In 2014 - as IS encircled - the BBC's Quentin Somerville gained access via an Iraqi military plane. ""Reminders of American occupation are everywhere - spent artillery shells and dusty accommodation quarters, with uneaten ration packs strewn across the floor,"" he reported. After the US returned to Iraq to fight IS in the same year, the base was secured and rebuilt. However, with far fewer troops, one airman noted in 2017 that ""it only offers a fraction of the comforts it once did"". On 26 December 2018, President Trump visited troops at the base. ""The men and women stationed at Al Asad have played a vital role in the military defeat of ISIS in Iraq and in Syria,"" he told them. But afterwards, he said he feared for his wife's safety during the visit. ""If you would have seen what we had to go through,"" he told reporters. In November last year, Vice-President Mike Pence also visited the base for Thanksgiving. It's thought there are around 1,500 US and coalition troops at Al Asad, and around 5,000 US troops in the country in total. This week, in a non-binding vote, the Iraqi parliament voted to expel them. In response, President Trump brought up the cost of the Al Asad air base. ""We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that's there,"" he said. ""It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it."" The other base that was attacked was in Irbil, the capital of Iraq's relatively stable Kurdistan region. In September, the US Army said it was home to ""more than 3,600 military and civilian personnel from 13 different nations"". The base is used to train local forces. Last month, US Central Command reported that the first female military instructors in the region had graduated from Irbil. How long the US will stay in Iraq, though, is uncertain. Only this week, Defence Secretary Mark Esper was forced to deny the US was withdrawing troops from the country.","The Al Asad air base is so vast that, after the US invasion, it had cinemas, swimming pools, fast food restaurants, and - not one - but two internal bus routes."
"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Then imagine the governor of the state starting a public protest against the FBI and the president for carrying out what she calls an act of vendetta against her government. Now imagine federal forces being deployed to protect their offices in the state, fearing attacks by supporters of the governor. This possibly sounds like a plot from a dystopian political novel. But it is what is happening in India. A group of detectives belonging to India's federal investigation agency, the CBI, arrived at the well-secured home of the commissioner of police of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) in West Bengal state on Sunday evening. They said they wanted to question Rajeev Kumar in connection with a ponzi scandal. (The multi-million dollar scam, involving businessmen, politicians, journalists and film producers, defrauded a large number of small investors.) But Mr Kumar refused to meet the detectives. Instead his forces detained the agents - who are recruited from the police forces themselves - and took them away to a police station. They were freed after a few hours, and returned without being able to question Mr Kumar. Mr Kumar had led the early local investigation into the scandal, before the case was taken over by the CBI under the supervision of the Supreme Court. The federal agency, say reports, unsuccessfully tried to question Mr Kumar half-a-dozen times in the past in connection with some evidence he had purportedly collected in the case. The agency believes that he is ""hiding"" something. The ponzi scandal, involving at least two small investment companies, came to light in 2013 under the watch of the leader of West Bengal state. In India's male-dominated politics, Mamata Banerjee is a rare firebrand woman leader who commands mass support. She took power in 2011, ending 34 years of communist rule in the state. (The following year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.) The feisty Ms Banerjee has ruled West Bengal ever since. Ms Banerjee has a testy relationship with the federal government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This is, in part, because Mr Modi's party is trying to make inroads into Bengal, using its usual mix of development promises and sectarian rhetoric. More on India from Soutik: After a series of setbacks in state polls Mr Modi no longer looks invincible in general elections due this summer. And Ms Banerjee, an astute rival, is trying to position herself as a prime ministerial contender, in the event of an opposition win. Recently, she organised a well-attended meeting of 23 opposition parties who vowed to defeat Mr Modi. Ms Banerjee, who is now holding an ""indefinite"" public protest in Kolkata, accuses Mr Modi's party of targeting her government. The BJP picked up 17% of vote share - but just two seats - in Bengal in the 2014 general elections. The party is desperately hoping for an improved performance this summer. It accuses Ms Banerjee of triggering a ""constitutional crisis"" by setting her police on federal agents. Historian Ramachandra Guha says the latest battle is a ""war between two ruthless and amoral politicians with absolute and equal disregard for institutional propriety"". In the end, this unprecedented - and ugly - incident is actually symptomatic of a worrying erosion of India's institutions and the regrettable breakdown of political bipartisanship. The CBI, which reports to the ruling federal government, was once described as a ""caged parrot"" and has been used by successive governments to hobble political opponents. It has, many believe, lost credibility. In October, the government had to remove the two men at the top of the agency after each accused the other of corruption. The standoff is the latest manifestation of a crisis that has often bedevilled the Indian state: the inability of an extremely powerful federal government - Mr Modi rules with an outright majority - to handle equally powerful and assertive regional leaders. It is a crisis which is at the heart of India's federalism.",Imagine state policemen in the US detaining FBI agents investigating a case on state territory.
"The two-minute video was produced by Shibushi city, who said it was meant to highlight their commitment to sustainable eel fishing. But it was widely accused of sexism, with one social media user calling it the ""delusions of a pervert"". It is not the first Japanese ad to feature women turning into animals. The advert, narrated by a man, opens with a teenage girl in a black swimsuit floating in a pool asking the narrator to feed her. ""I decided I would do everything I could for her. I gave her delicious food until she was full and made sure she could sleep well at night,"" the narrator says. Scenes of the idyllic Japanese countryside are also shown in-between shots. The audience sees her transformation slowly begin when she is unable to pick up an object because her hands have become slimy. She is later seen diving into the pool, transforming into an eel, saying ""goodbye"" as she swims away. The video then ends with the words ""we're farming [eels] with care"" appearing on-screen. Viewers on social media were quick to respond to the ad. ""Of all the bizarre sexist ads, this one from Japan takes the eel,"" said one user on Twitter. ""This makes me think of a girl who is being kidnapped and locked up... It's the delusions of a pervert,"" another commented. City officials later pulled the ad, saying they were ""aware that some people were offended"". ""We just wanted to make a video that simply explains the city is known for eel farming"" a local official told news agency AFP. Earlier this year, a Japanese company found itself in similar trouble. It produced an advert comparing high school students to cows being bred for meat or dairy farming. One teenage girl is singled out for her ability to produce milk. Users described that video as ""udderly weird"".","A Japanese advertisement showing a teenage girl in a swimsuit turning into an eel has been pulled after complaints it was sexist and ""perverted""."
"Spanghero's licence is being suspended while an inquiry continues, Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll said. The firm has denied the allegations, saying it only ever dealt in meat it believed to be beef. A widening scandal over mislabelled horsemeat has affected at least 12 European countries. In the UK, three people have been arrested on suspicion of fraud in connection with the sale of horsemeat. Two suspects were detained at a meat processing plant near Aberystwyth in Wales, and a third was arrested at an abattoir in West Yorkshire. Paper trail The French government believes that the sale of horsemeat labelled as beef went on for six months and involved about 750 tonnes of meat. Spanghero imported meat from Romania and sold it on to another company, Comigel, which made frozen ready meals at its factory in Luxembourg. French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said the meat had left Romania clearly and correctly labelled as horse. It was afterwards that it was relabelled as beef. ""From the investigation, it would seem that the first agent or actor in this network who stamped 'beef' on horsemeat from Romania was Spanghero,"" Mr Hamon said. There was ""no reason to doubt the good faith"" of the Romanian abattoir that originally provided the meat, Mr Hamon added. The investigation says some blame may rest with Comigel, which made the ready meals sold around Europe. Staff there should have noticed anomalies in the paperwork, and realised from the smell and look of the meat once it was defrosted that it was not beef, Mr Hamon said. Spanghero has strongly denied wrongdoing. ""Spanghero confirms having placed an order for beef, having been led to believe it received beef, and having sold back what it thought was beef, properly labelled as such, in line with European and French regulations,"" the company said in a statement. International conspiracy The latest country to be hit by the crisis is Germany, where some supermarket chains have removed frozen lasagne from sale after traces of horsemeat were detected. The widening scandal has raised questions about the complexity of the food industry's supply chains across Europe. The UK has asked the European investigative agency Europol to co-ordinate a Continent-wide investigation into an alleged international conspiracy to pass horsemeat off as beef. On Wednesday the EU urged member states to conduct random DNA tests for horsemeat in beef products from 1 March. EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg said the programme of random tests should report after 30 days, but testing should continue for three months. Mr Borg was speaking after a meeting in Brussels with agriculture ministers from affected countries. He said member states should also test for the presence of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone - known as ""bute"". The painkiller is used to treat horses - particularly racehorses - but is considered potentially harmful to humans. On Thursday, Britain's Food Standard Agency - the FSA - said tests eight horses that were killed in the UK had tested positive for bute, and six may have entered the food chain in France. But England's chief medical officer said the highest level detected posed ""very little risk to human health"". The prime minister's spokesman said the UK was working closely with the French authorities to track the carcasses. French food producer makes order Comigel HQ in Metz, north-east France, asks its subsidiary, Tavola in Luxembourg, to make food products - including beef lasagne for Findus. Factory orders meat The Tavola factory orders the meat from Spanghero in the south of France. Subcontractor used Spanghero contacts a subcontractor in Cyprus to source the meat. Subcontractor enlists trader The Cypriot subcontractor in turn contacts a trader in the Netherlands. Trader orders from Romania The trader in the Netherlands places an order for meat with abattoirs in Romania. Abattoirs send meat to France The meat from the abattoirs travels to Spanghero in France. However, Romania rejects claims that it was responsible for wrongly describing the horsemeat from its abattoirs as beef. Horsemeat is always labelled as such, they say. The Romanian authorities claim records show orders had been for horse carcass - easily distinguishable from beef. Meat used to make products Spanghero sends the meat to the Comigel subsidiary’s factory in Luxembourg before the finished products are supplied to Findus and retailers across Europe, including the UK. The president of Comigel says the company was unaware the meat was coming from abroad. Horsemeat found in Ireland and UK Tests by Irish authorities have found equine DNA in beefburgers made by firms in the Irish Republic and the UK. Traces of horsemeat have also been found in stored meat at another plant in Ireland and one in Northern Ireland. In mainland Britain, police and officials probing alleged horsemeat mislabelling have carried out raids at a slaughterhouse in West Yorkshire and a meat firm near Aberystwyth. Three men were later arrested on suspicion of offences under the Fraud Act..","French meat processing company Spanghero knowingly sold horsemeat labelled as beef, the French government has said."
"Reports say supporters of the king threw stones at the hundreds of protesters camped in Gamal Abdel Nasser Square, injuring a number of them. The protesters were demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit, reforms to parliament and for corrupt officials to stand trial. King Abdullah appointed Mr Bakhit last month after large street protests. Thursday's demonstration - which was organised through the social networking website Facebook by a group calling itself Youth of March 24 - saw student protesters joined by leftists and members of the Islamist opposition. Some witnesses said the police stood by as a group of government supporters moved in to the square and began throwing stones. As many as 35 people were reported injured, most with head wounds. Jordan's opposition has demanded electoral reforms that would see the prime minister directly elected and more powers granted to the parliament. In a letter published in Jordanian newspapers on Wednesday, King Abdullah urged Prime Minister Bakhit to push through parliament reforms the monarch proposed in February, after the last prime minister was sacked. At that time, Jordanians had taken to the streets in largely peaceful protests to demand on political reforms, high unemployment and rising prices. Mr Bakhit is a retired army major-general who served as Jordan's prime minister from 2005 until his resignation in 2007. Jordan is just one of the countries in the region where protests have been held to demand political changes after the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt were toppled in January and February.",Supporters of Jordan's government have clashed with protesters demanding political reforms in the capital Amman.
"Deputy Gavin St Pier said a payment had been due to be paid to Lagan Construction, which is currently carrying out the airport redevelopment. However, the payment made on 10 July was made to a third party bank account. He said a police investigation had been launched with the hope of recovering the funds. Deputy St Pier said: ""The department received a fraudulent letter that purported to be from Lagan Construction advising of a change in their bank account. ""These instructions appeared to be genuine and the department made the change to its systems. ""So when due the next monthly payment was paid to the third party's account and not to Lagan."" He said: ""The department does of course have internal controls in place, clearly these were inadequate in preventing this particular fraud from occurring. ""The internal controls were immediately changed to prevent a recurrence."" Deputy St Pier said the Policy Council had agreed to commission an independent external review. Guernsey Police's commercial fraud department said one arrest had been made in the UK in connection with the fraud and a small percentage of the funds recovered. Det Con Nigel Henaghen said it would be ""a complex and protracted investigation"" and they were being assisted by the Guernsey Border Agency.","The States of Guernsey has been defrauded of £2.6m, the island's Treasury and Resources Minister has announced."

"The federal court judge set a 22 October trial date. Mr Musk is being sued by Vern Unsworth, who helped rescue the 12 boys from Thailand's Tham Luang caves last year. The Tesla boss called Mr Unsworth a ""pedo"" in a Twitter post after the Briton said Mr Musk's attempt to help in the rescue was a ""PR stunt"". Why has this come to court? Mr Unsworth helped recruit experienced UK cave divers, who were instrumental in freeing the boys who had become stuck in the cave due to rising water levels in July 2018. While efforts were ongoing, Mr Musk sent engineers from his Tesla company and a small submarine to Thailand to help free the boys. It was never used. In an interview with CNN, Mr Unsworth called Mr Musk's efforts a ""publicity stunt"". Responding in a series of tweets, Mr Musk elaborated on how the submarine might work and referred to Mr Unsworth as ""pedo guy"". Mr Musk soon apologised and deleted the offending tweets, saying he had acted ""in anger"". But he reignited the row in September. In an email to a Buzzfeed reporter, he implored the journalist to ""find out what's actually going on"" and suggested the diver had taken no part in the cave rescue. Mr Unsworth is seeking at least $75,000 (£57,700) in compensation plus punitive damages in his September 2018 lawsuit. The suit also seeks a court order preventing Mr Musk from making any further disparaging comments. He said the Tesla chief executive defamed him with ""unlawful, unsupportable and reprehensible accusations"", according to court documents. In seeking a dismissal, Mr Musk's lawyers argued the comments were ""imaginative"" or ""over-the-top"" insults in the heat of the moment that were protected under the US First Amendment. But the judge said Mr Musk was not communicating in ""heated and volatile"" settings that might explain any excesses.","Elon Musk must defend himself in court after calling a diver who helped save Thai schoolboys trapped in a cave a paedophile, a Los Angeles judge says."
"Francisco Reyes and Heriberto Valdez are accused of allowing the rape and abuse of 11 women at the Sepur Zarco military base in the 1980s. The UN says rape was used as a weapon of war by the Guatemalan military. Such an offence has never before been tried in the country where the crimes occurred. In the courtroom the 11 alleged victims wearing traditional Mayan indigenous dress sat with their heads and faces covered. In solidarity, other women in the room also covered their heads. The two defendants, Francisco Reyes Giron and his regional commander, Heriberto Valdez Asij, are accused of allowing their troops to rape and abuse the women at the military base. Both have denied any wrongdoing. The base, near Sepur Zarco in eastern Guatemala, was being used as a ""rest and recreation base"" for troops fighting left-wing guerrillas in the Guatemalan highlands. At a pre-trial hearing the women told the judge that their husbands had been murdered by the soldiers. Then, a few weeks later, they came back for the women, they said. Soldiers raped them and burned down their houses and crops, and forced them to move into shacks outside the military base. Every two or three days, each woman was allegedly made to report for three-day shifts at the base where they were forced to cook and clean, and where they were systematically raped by the soldiers. The women endured the shifts for 10 months in 1982-83. But some were not released from bondage until the military base closed in 1998. Bringing the case to trial has been tortuous. The victims are now in their seventies and eighties. The speak no Spanish, only the Mayan language, Q'eqchi. Supported by women's' rights and advocacy groups, the women and five male witnesses decided to come forward with their stories in 2011. The two ex-military officers were arrested in June 2014 and the case initially went to trial in October. But it was put on hold because of challenges by the defence. A UN report has described how the Guatemalan military used rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war during almost 40 years of the armed conflict which ended in 1996 with a peace accord. The trial is expected to last 40 days.",A trial has begun in Guatemala of two ex-military officers for human rights abuses against indigenous women during the country's long armed conflict.
"Some of these have been related to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws, while others appear to have a political motive. How many Christians are there in Pakistan? Pakistan is overwhelmingly Muslim but after Hindus, Christians are the second-largest minority group, representing about 1.6% of the population. The southern metropolis of Karachi has a large Christian population and there are countless Christian villages in the Punjab heartland and cities of Lahore and Faisalabad. There is also a sizeable population in the deeply conservative north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, particularly in Peshawar city. Pre-partition Pakistan was a much more diverse place but tolerance has declined as society has been increasingly Islamicised and more homogenous. Before partition minorities made up 15% of the population, now they fall short of 4%. Are they an influential group? The majority of Pakistan's Christians are descended from low-caste Hindus who converted under the British Raj, in part to escape the caste system. Many provided labour in garrison towns and every cantonment city has an area known as Lal Kurti, traditionally the area where Christians reside. But Christian communities remains in the poorest sector of society doing menial jobs. Entire villages in parts of Punjab are Christian with inhabitants working as labourers and farmhands. There are sections of the Christian community that are well off. They came over from Goa under the Raj, are more educated and mainly settled in Karachi. What all of them share is a sense of vulnerability, with a number of wealthier Christians leaving to settle in Canada and Australia as the climate of intolerance in Pakistan becomes more unbearable. Why are they being attacked? Muslims and Christians mostly co-exist amiably enough without frequent outbreaks of animosity. But accusations of blasphemy have also often led to mob violence against Christians, while militant Islamists have also targeted the community. Recent attacks include: Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have also been convicted for desecrating the Koran or blaspheming against Prophet Muhammad, although experts say most accusations are fuelled by personal disputes. While most were awarded death sentences by lower courts, those sentences were often set aside by higher courts due to lack of evidence, or because the complainants were found to be targeting the community for economic benefits. In 2012, a Christian girl, Rimsha Masih, became the first non-Muslim to be acquitted in a blasphemy case when it was discovered that she had been framed by a local Muslim cleric. Perhaps the best known example is that of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman from a Punjab village who in 2010 got into an altercation with some Muslim women and was later accused by them of having blasphemed. Salman Taseer, then the governor of Punjab who stated that Pakistan's strict blasphemy law had been abused in the case, was later murdered by his Islamist bodyguard, Mumtaz Qadri. Qadri was found guilty and executed in February 2016, prompting mass protests. Pakistan's minister for minority affairs and a Christian leader, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated in 2011 by the Taliban for speaking out against the law. Are there any other reasons? Some of the violence is directly related to the American-led war in Afghanistan, so it has an expressly political motive. Months after the US-led coalition attacked Afghanistan in late 2001, a grenade attack on a chapel inside a Christian mission hospital Taxila city killed four people. A couple of months later, gunmen executed six workers of a Christian charity in their Karachi office. These incidents, though isolated, have continued through the years. Attacks on Pakistan's Christian and Hindu minorities could be part of a militant plan to send a message to the West or embarrass Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif when he appears to be too friendly to the West.","The Taliban attack at a Lahore park was the latest in an escalating number of attacks on Christians in Pakistan, explains the BBC's M Ilyas Khan."
"Cho was jailed for a year in February but the court on Friday ruled she should serve a suspended sentence. She was convicted of violating plane safety after ordering a taxiing plane back to the gate to offload a steward who had served the nuts the wrong way. But the appeal court ruled she did not cause a change in the flight path. It gave Cho a reduced sentence of 10 months and suspended the prison term for two years. She remains guilty of using violence against flight attendants. She did not answer questions from reporters and quickly left in a car. Cho, also known as Cho Hyun-ah, was a vice-president of Korean Air. She is also the daughter of the company's chairman. Analysis from Stephen Evans, BBC South Korea Correspondent Cho Hyun-ah arrived at the appeal-court under police guard, dressed in the plain green overalls of the South Korean prison service. She left, having changed swiftly, into the black non-prison garb which has become her ""outfit of contrition"". Before she was imprisoned at the end of last year, she repeatedly paraded herself before batteries of television cameras. Dressed in black from head to foot, voice at a whisper, she would express her contrition. So she appeared today, though without the big apology. The court had quashed one of her convictions - illegally deviating a flight - a charge intended for hijackers. But the assault in the form of jabbing the flight attendant with a bunch of papers was not over-turned. That verdict stands. And surely so does the humiliation. She became ""nut-rage woman"" around the world. That memory can't be erased. Nor can a bigger question in the minds of many South Koreans. The economy is dominated by family-run chaebols - or firms - huge conglomerates answerable to no-one but the family oligarch. Often these companies are very successful, sometimes they aren't. Cho had a job on the board of Korean Air. She was the boss's daughter. Is keeping business in the family a good way of running an economy? On 5 December last year, Cho became angry while onboard a Korean Air flight in New York after she was served macadamia nuts which she did not ask for, and which were still in a bag, not in a bowl. She confronted both the flight attendant who served her and chief steward Park Chang-jin about the presentation, at one point jabbing Mr Park with a service manual. Cho then ordered the plane, which was taxiing at JFK Airport, to return to the terminal to offload Mr Park. Cho had been in custody since she was arrested on 30 December. In February she was convicted and sentenced to one year in jail. One of the judges on the appeal panel said on Friday that they had taken into consideration that she was a first time offender. ""It appears that she will have to live under heavy criticism from society, and stigma,"" he said. The case attracted intense attention in South Korea, reopening a national debate about the Korean business system, which is dominated by family firms known as chaebols. Some of the families running these businesses have been accused of high-handedness and acting with impunity.","Former Korean Air executive Heather Cho, who was jailed for an outburst over macadamia nuts, has been freed after winning a court appeal."
"Two tigers have died of ""bacterial infection"", while a third tiger and two lions died of old age at Bennerghatta national park, a wildlife official said. The park has been disinfected and staff asked to maintain hygiene, he said. There are over 1,400 tigers and several hundred lions in the wild in India. Two lions and a Siberian tiger died first at the 25,000-acre park located near the southern city of Bangalore. Wildlife officials attributed their deaths to old age. But the deaths of a four-year-old tigress and a three-month-old cub were caused by food and water-borne bacteria, officials said. The park, a popular tourist destination, has 47 tigers and nine lions. It is home to many endangered animals and considered an important corridor for elephants in southern India.",The deaths of three tigers and two lions in less than a week has prompted an investigation by national park authorities in India.
"By Thom PooleBBC News Diplomatic ties have been broken, angry words exchanged and Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran. But the dispute between the two Middle Eastern nations has deep religious, historic and political roots. Religious divisions are a factor, but not the only one Iran and Saudi Arabia are on opposing sides of a more than 1,000-year old argument at the heart of Islam - between Sunnis and Shia. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, his followers split over who was his rightful heir. It is important not to overstate the division. Sunnis and Shia share fundamental beliefs, and have co-existed for centuries - the animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia is better understood in terms of a power struggle in the Middle East and beyond. But despite this, sectarianism is an ugly reality in many of the conflicts raging today. Iran and Saudi Arabia's status as leading exponents of Shia and Sunni Islam respectively have informed their foreign policies, with both sides forming alliances with countries who share their theologies - and backing militant groups in those that don't. Islam's ancient schism The Iranian revolution launched decades of hostility The recent rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia can be traced to the Iranian revolution of 1979, which saw a pro-Western leader toppled and Shia religious authorities taking over. Tehran began backing Shia militias and parties abroad, and Riyadh - concerned at the growing influence of a newly-strident Iran - strengthened links to other Sunni governments, including the formation of the Gulf Co-operation Council. The 1980s saw tensions between Saudi and Iran escalate - Saudi Arabia backed Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and after clashes at the hajj in 1987 killed hundreds of Iranian pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties for three years. Another key milestone was the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the overthrow of Saddam Hussein saw a Shia-led government come to power in Riyadh's neighbour. The Arab Spring saw Iran support its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with the Saudis backing the opposition when popular protests turned into civil war. In Bahrain, Saudi troops helped put down anti-government protests by the majority Shia population there. Saudi Arabia felt threatened by last year's Iranian nuclear deal, fearing the easing of sanctions would allow Tehran to further support Shia groups in the Middle East. If you add to this the Iranian fury over a deadly stampede during last year's Hajj pilgrimage and a more assertive Saudi foreign policy since the new king took charge, then the row over the execution of Sheikh Nimr becomes just the latest in a long-running struggle. Iran-Saudi crisis 'most dangerous for decades' The pair are on opposing sides in major conflicts Today there are two ongoing major flashpoints - Syria and Yemen. As news emerged of the executions, a Saudi-led coalition battling Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen officially announced the end of a ceasefire that neither side had ever fully observed. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of backing the Shia group, and intervened to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Divisions on Syria boil down to the fact that Iran wants its ally, President Assad, to stay while Saudi Arabia says he must go. Both support rival fighters on the ground. Painstaking efforts were taken to get the two sides to join peace talks later this month aimed at resolving a conflict that has killed more than 250,000 people, but with Riyadh-Tehran diplomatic ties severed, chances of success look ever more distant. Where key countries stand on Syria What happens next is unclear, but the situation is dangerous Perhaps the only thing we can be certain about is that hostile Iranian-Saudi relations will only prolong the misery of Yemen and Syria, with a diplomatic solution unlikely and both sides keen to prevent the other gaining influence. International reaction has been predictable, with Saudi allies such as Bahrain also taking measures to downgrade or end relations with Iran. World powers have called for de-escalation. The US is in a delicate position, being a long-term ally of Saudi Arabia but seeing a thaw in ties with Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal. American foreign policy is undergoing a ""pivot"" towards Asia; the US enjoys greater energy security following a fracking boom - how far would Washington be prepared to wade into the row? The gloomiest prediction from commentators is that the region could be entering a version of the Thirty Years' War, which saw Catholic and Protestant states battle for supremacy in the 17th Century. But many will be hoping those angered by Sheikh Nimr's death will take the advice of the cleric's own brother, Mohammed, who said any protests should be peaceful.",Iran and Saudi Arabia are locked in an escalating dispute over the Saudi execution of leading Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr.
"Tests carried out showed that only products from the Yili Group are contaminated. The firm, based in the Inner Mongolia city of Hohhot, said it will investigate the cause of the problem. A contamination by melamine in 2008 killed six babies and made 300,000 ill. Among 715 infant formula product samples that have been examined so far, only batches from Yili are detected with ""an unusual level"" of mercury, said China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) in a statement on Thursday. A spokesperson from the local quality supervision bureau in Inner Mongolia said that two samples from Yili were found with mercury concentration of 0.034mg/Kg and 0.045mg/kg. High levels of mercury can cause damages to brain and kidneys. Yili Group said on their website that the recall only applies to Quan You baby formula produced between November 2011 and May 2012. No problems are found in other products, it said. The company also said in the statement that there is ""no benchmark for mercury levels in milk powder products available from China and abroad"". Yili's recall takes place during China's ""Food Safety Week"" and a day after the cabinet introduced fresh measures to tighten food safety control. The company, China's biggest milk producer by revenue, has seen its share prices fall below the 10% day limit in Shanghai on Friday, the Reuters news agency reported.

"The US National Science Foundation (NSF) said the telescope's 900-ton instrument platform fell onto a reflector dish some 450ft (137m) below. It came just weeks after officials announced that the telescope would be dismantled amid safety fears, following damage to its support system. The Arecibo Observatory telescope was one of the largest in the world. It was a key scientific resource for radio astronomers for 57 years, and was also made famous as the backdrop for a scene in the James Bond film GoldenEye and other Hollywood movies. The NSF said there had been no reports of injuries following the collapse. What happened to the telescope? The NSF said the telescope collapsed at about 07:55 local time (11:55 GMT) on Tuesday, ""resulting in damage to the dish and surrounding facilities"". The telescope consisted of a 1,000ft-wide radio dish with an instrument platform hanging 450ft above. The platform was suspended by cables connected to three towers. The NSF said an investigation into the platform's fall was ongoing. ""Initial findings indicate that the top section of all three of the... telescope's support towers broke off. As the 900-ton instrument platform fell, the telescope's support cables also dropped,"" it said in a statement. ""Preliminary assessments indicate the observatory's learning centre sustained significant damage from falling cables,"" it added. Two cables had broken since August, damaging the structure and forcing officials to close the observatory. A review last month found that the telescope was at risk of catastrophic collapse and said the huge structure could not be repaired without posing a potentially deadly risk to construction workers. Officials said the structure would be dismantled. Following the announcement, three members of Congress, including Puerto Rico's representative Jenniffer González, requested funds ""to enable the NSF to continue exploring options to safely stabilise the structure"". Jonathan Friedman, who worked for 26 years as a senior research associate at the observatory and still lives near it, told the Associated Press news agency of the moment the telescope collapsed on Tuesday. ""It sounded like a rumble. I knew exactly what it was,"" he said. ""I was screaming. Personally, I was out of control... I don't have words to express it. It's a very deep, terrible feeling."" The NSF said it was ""saddened"" by the collapse and would be ""looking for ways to assist the scientific community and maintain our strong relationship with the people of Puerto Rico"". ""Top priorities are maintaining safety at the site, conducting a complete damage assessment as quickly as possible, and taking action to contain and mitigate any environmental damage caused by the structure or its materials. ""While the telescope was a key part of the facility, the observatory has other scientific and educational infrastructure that NSF will work with stakeholders to bring back online,"" the agency said. What is the history of the telescope? By Paul Rincon, Science editor, BBC News website The telescope was built in the early 1960s, with the intention of studying the ionised upper part of Earth's atmosphere, the ionosphere. But it was soon being used as an all-purpose radio observatory. Radio astronomy is a field within the larger discipline that observes objects in the Universe by studying them at radio frequencies. A number of cosmic phenomena such as pulsars - magnetised, rotating stars - show emission at radio wavelengths. The observatory provided the first solid evidence for a type of object known as a neutron star. It was also used to identify the first example of a binary pulsar (two magnetised neutron stars orbiting around a common centre of mass), which earned its discoverers the Nobel Prize in Physics. The telescope helped to make the first definitive detection of exoplanets, planetary bodies orbiting other stars, in 1992. It has also been used to listen for signals from intelligent life elsewhere in the cosmos and to track near-Earth asteroids. Over the years, the main dish appeared as a location in movies, including GoldenEye, Pierce Brosnan's first outing as James Bond in 1995, and the 1997 science fiction drama Contact, starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey.

The whole effort is prompted by the shock emanating from Russia's seizure and subsequent annexation of the Crimea, and its continuing support for rebel groups in eastern Ukraine. If Moscow could tear up the rule-book of security in post-Cold War Europe by carving off a slice of Ukraine (as it previously did in Georgia), many feared the Baltic republics - also territory of the former Soviet Union - could be next. Russia says that in response to these Nato moves, it is making new deployments of its own. But the reality is rather more complex. I've been speaking to some of the leading Western experts on the Russian military to get a sense of what is behind Russia's modernisation effort, and to determine what threat it really poses and to whom. ""Russia would like us to think that its current militarisation and preparations for conflict are a response to Nato doing the same, but it's simply not true."" That's the view of Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, and probably Britain's leading watcher of Russian military matters. ""Russia's enormously expensive reorganisation and rearmament programme,"" he told me, ""was already in full swing well before the crisis over Ukraine, while Nato nations were still winding down their militaries. ""As late as 2013, the US withdrew all its armour from Europe - while Russia was already busy investing billions in upgrading its forces."" Analyst Dmitry Gorenburg of Harvard University dates the start of the Russian modernisation programme to 2009. It was a response, he says, to the evident shortcomings in the Russian military campaign against Georgia. He says the main focus was ""the improvement of the speed of decision-making and communication of decisions to the troops, and interoperability among military branches, followed by the replacement of Soviet-era equipment that was rapidly reaching the end of its service life"". The results have been significant. According to Michael Kofman of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, ""by 2012 Russia had reorganised its armed forces from a Soviet mass mobilisation army into a permanent standing force, and began improving quality across the board"". This was coupled with an intense regimen of snap checks on readiness and countless exercises, to the extent that ""by 2014 the Russian military was markedly improved compared to its lacklustre performance in the Russia-Georgia war in 2008,"" he says. All the experts I spoke to insist that the initial focus of the Russian effort has been on Ukraine, not the Baltics. Indeed, Michael Kofman argues that the war in Ukraine imposed unexpected requirements on Russia's military, which found itself lacking permanently stationed forces on the country's borders, and ill-positioned for the conflict. ""Russian armed forces,"" he says, ""were, and still are, in transition."" To address the prospect of war with Ukraine in the medium to long term, he says, Russia ""has spent much of the past three years repositioning units around Ukraine, building three new divisions, rebasing several brigades, and creating an entire new combined-arms army. The intent is for Russian ground forces to be in place just across the border should they need to reinforce proxies in the Donbas, invade from several vectors, or simply deter Kiev from thinking it could quickly retake the separatist regions by force"". Ukraine may be the immediate strategic concern of the Russian general staff. But as Keir Giles notes, ""Russia is developing its military infrastructure all the way along its western periphery - not just opposite Ukraine, but also Belarus, the Baltic states and even Finland. They have re-organised in order to be able to deliver combat troops to the western border as rapidly as possible"". This includes ""setting up new heavy road transport units in order to reduce their traditional reliance on railways to deliver armour to the operational area. That gives them a lot more flexibility to move in areas where road networks are better developed - primarily the west of Russia, including across the border in Russia's western neighbours,"" he tells me. Given Moscow's focus on Ukraine, have some Nato countries over-reacted to the perceived Russian threat? Not at all, says Keir Giles. On the contrary, he insists, the concern is that Nato has under-reacted. ""The direct military challenge from Russia, and confirmation of Russia's willingness to use military force against its neighbours,"" he argues, ""with few exceptions, hasn't translated into European countries taking a serious interest in defending themselves."" He adds that the failure of many Nato allies to meet even symbolic commitments, like the pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence, let alone urgent real measures like regenerating the capacity for high-intensity warfare to match Russia's developing capabilities, ""speaks of an unwillingness to recognise politically inconvenient reality"". That reality, according to Michael Kofman, is nothing short of a transformation of the Russian military. ""Reform, modernisation and the combat experience gleaned from Ukraine and Syria will have lasting effects on the Russian armed forces,"" he told me. ""Russia,"" he says, ""retains the ability to deploy decisive force anywhere on its borders, overpowering any former Soviet republic. In terms of its strategic nuclear arsenal, Russia is not only a peer to the United States, but actually ahead in modernisation and investment in non-strategic nuclear weapons. ""Meanwhile Russia's conventional forces are now capable of imposing high costs on even a technologically superior adversary such as Nato in a high-end conflict - i.e. a fight would be quite bloody for both sides."" That is hopefully an unthinkable situation. At root, though, Dmitry Gorenburg believes that ""Russia's conventional capabilities will be nowhere near as strong as those of the US military or Nato forces as a whole"". Above all it is readiness, proximity, and the ability to mass fire-power quickly that gives Russia an immediate local advantage. But Nato needs to get the threat into perspective. As Michael Kofman notes, ""Russia is a Eurasian land power, bringing a lot of firepower to the fight, but its strength shines when fighting close to home."" Nato's defence and research budget dwarfs Russia's, as does the base capacity of the alliance to generate forces and equip them in a prolonged conflict. ""The bottom line,"" he says, is that ""while Nato has genuine worries on what a short-term conflict with Russia might look like, the reality is that this is the world's pre-eminent military alliance, at the core of which is still an incredibly potent military power, and a sustained fight would probably end disastrously for Moscow."" The Russian military is simply not structured to hold substantial territory, or to generate the forces needed for a prolonged conflict. Nato needs to be ready, in the view of experts. If deterrence is going to be credible it needs to restore its ability to fight high-intensity combat, a capacity that has atrophied during the counter-insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The consensus among the experts seems to be that Ukraine was a warning bell. Russia's newfound assertiveness is not to be confused with a desire to launch a military attack westwards. Indeed, the immediate Russian threat may come from its information warfare and cyber campaigns directed against the West. That's a battle that has already been joined. And it is one the West is equally ill-prepared for.","Nato defence ministers are reviewing progress in what's known as the alliance's ""enhanced forward presence"" - its deployment of troops eastwards to reassure worried allies, and deter any Russian move west."
"By Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Critics said it was not just about skin colour but identity too. This was not simply about translation but whether Gorman's poetry could be accurately reflected, interpreted by someone of a different ethnicity, genre, and mother tongue. One day after accepting the task, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld decided not to go ahead after all. Who is Rijneveld? Dutch publisher Meulenhoff described poet Marieke Lucas Rijneveld as a ""dream candidate"", who at 29 became the youngest author to win the International Booker prize in 2020 with debut novel The Discomfort of Evening. Amanda Gorman had selected Rijneveld herself, as a fellow young writer who had also come to fame early, said the publisher. Outspoken on issues including gender equality and mental health, Rijneveld identifies as non-binary and uses the pronouns they/them. Marieke Lucas Rijneveld initially revealed the news of being chosen to translate Amanda Gorman's works on Twitter, accompanied by two sparkling heart emojis. There was praise too for a poet who had highlighted their own respective struggles, and congratulations on a first translation job. Why the outcry? ""Incomprehensible"" was how Janice Deul described the choice of a white translator. In an opinion piece for the Volkskrant newspaper the journalist and diversity campaigner suggested instead going for someone like Gorman who was a ""spoken word artist, young, a woman and unapologetically black"". ""I'm not saying a black person can't translate white work, and vice versa,"" Janice Deul told me when we met near her home in Leiden. ""But not this specific poem of this specific orator in this Black Lives Matter area, that's the whole issue."" Unlike written poetry, spoken word is less about the visuals on a page than rhyme, repetition and word-play and can encompass elements of hip-hop and improvisation. Ethics or ethnicity? Translators serve as a bridge between two languages and Monica Slingerland, head of the opinion editorial team at Trouw newspaper, believes the Gorman debate has raised significant issues that have not really surfaced before. ""I tried to get out of the skin tone issue for a moment and ask the question again. Can a man translate a book about giving birth? A look into the bookcase shows that this requirement was rarely imposed on the translator in the past, not even with books that are at least as loaded with content as Gorman's poem."" She cites Simone de Beauvoir's feminist pamphlet The Second Sex, translated into Dutch by a man. Or Americanah by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, translated into Dutch by Hien Montijn who is of Chinese-Indonesian descent. For Quinsy Gario, a black Dutch spoken word artist, Gorman's words need to be handled with care as they involve embodied knowledge and the cultural baggage that come with being black. ""The Dutch language needs to have a conduit, a person that's been able to push to the same extent as Amanda Gorman did, and connect to a local understanding of what those words mean, and how those words can resonate."" Why Rijneveld was asked Although Amanda Gorman did initially agree to the Dutch poet translating her work, none of the Netherlands' black spoken word poets were presented to her as options. In a statement the publisher told the BBC: ""Meulenhoff asked MLR if they wanted to be the translator. They said yes, and then Meulenhoff sent their profile to the American agent as their preferred choice."" Three ""sensitivity readers"" had been included in the contract. It was a decision that Janice Deul believes perpetuated the marginalisation of black voices in the Netherlands. She wants Dutch publishing houses to expand their horizons and look behind their ""white ivory tower"". ""Why only celebrate Amanda, as we should? Why be blind to all the talents we have in our own country,"" she asks. Among the many examples of black Dutch poets are Zaire Krieger, whose work encapsulates the challenges of being a woman of colour in a white country, Rachel Rumai who recently featured in an Afro Lit anthology and spoken word artist Babs Gons, whose Polyglot was chosen as the poem for 2021 Dutch Book Week. How did Rijneveld respond? Marieke Lucas Rijneveld answered the critics with a poem, Everything inhabitable, published in a number of newspapers, including in English translation in the UK. Never lost that resistance and yet able to grasp when it isn't your place, when you must kneel for a poem because another person can make it more inhabitable; not out of unwillingness, not out of dismay, but because you know there is so much inequality, people still discriminated against Excerpt from Everything inhabitable It was written in Dutch and translated into English by Michele Hutchison. Not surprising for a poet who admitted last year to having ""very bad English"". But Rijneveld's decision not to translate Amanda Gorman's poem into Dutch has only heightened the debate in the Netherlands over the ethics of translation and underlined Gorman's original sentiments of the hills that ""all other black girls"" must climb.",Amanda Gorman's The Hill We Climb stole the show at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration but when a renowned Dutch author was asked to translate her work there was an outcry because the translator is not black.
"On Tuesday Mr Trump tweeted that the US was not afraid of acting alone on North Korea if China would not help. Tensions have risen on the Korean peninsula after the dispatch of US warships to the region. North Korea reacted with anger, saying it would defend itself ""powerfully"". Mr Xi and Mr Trump had met in person just last weekend at a summit in Florida where they discussed North Korea. Their phone call took place on Wednesday morning, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. The White House has not released any details. During the conversation, Mr Xi said China ""is committed to the target of denuclearisation on the peninsula, safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula, and advocates resolving problems through peaceful means,"" CCTV said. Earlier on Wednesday, editorials published by Chinese state media outlet Global Times called on North Korea to ""hit the brakes for peace"", noting that the US ""doesn't plan to co-exist with a nuclear-armed Pyongyang. ""Pyongyang can continue its tough stance, however, for its own security, it should at least halt provocative nuclear and missile activities. Pyongyang should avoid making mistakes at this time."" 'North Korea is looking for trouble' The call came hours after Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday about his earlier meeting with Mr Xi. ""I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!"" he said. ""North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A."" In a Tuesday interview with US news channel Fox Business Network, Mr Trump also said: ""We are sending an armada. Very powerful... We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier."" Earlier this week the Carl Vinson Strike Group, which comprises an aircraft carrier and other warships, was diverted from Singapore to the west Pacific, where it recently conducted exercises with South Korea's navy. The Japanese navy has also planned military exercises with the US warships, the Reuters wire agency reported. The ships' deployment angered North Korea, which said it proved Pyongyang was right to develop nuclear weapons to defend itself or use in a pre-emptive strike. It added that the US showed ""reckless moves for invading"", and warned it would defend itself ""by powerful force of arms"". North Korea has carrying out missile tests with increasing frequency in recent months, despite a ban on its nuclear and missile activity by the UN. It claimed earlier this year that it was close to testing an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) carrying a nuclear warhead - which could possibly reach North America - although experts have cast serious doubts on such claims.","China's President Xi Jinping has called for a ""peaceful"" resolution to tensions over North Korea, in a phone conversation with US President Donald Trump, Chinese state media said."
"Tibet-born Baimadajie Angwang is accused of reporting on the activities of Chinese citizens in the New York area and assessing potential sources of intelligence in the Tibetan community. The naturalised US citizen, who worked for the police department's community affairs unit, was arrested on Monday. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison. According to prosecutors, Angwang is also employed by the US Army Reserve, working as a civil affairs specialist. He is accused of being in contact with two officials at the Chinese consulate. Aside from reporting on Tibetans in the city, he allegedly provided the consulate with access to senior NYPD officials through invitations to official events. Angwang told his Chinese official handler that he wanted to be promoted within the NYPD so that he could assist China and bring the country ""glory"", court documents said. Angwang is also accused of committing wire fraud, making false statements and obstructing an official proceeding. Court documents said he received ""multiple substantial wire transfers from the PRC [People's Republic of China]"". According to the documents, his father is a retired member of China's army and a member of the Communist Party of China. His mother is also a member of the party and a former government official. ""As alleged in this federal complaint, Baimadajie Angwang violated every oath he took in this country. One to the United States, another to the US Army, and a third to this Police Department,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot F Shea said in a statement. Tibet, a remote and mainly Buddhist territory, is governed as an autonomous region of China. Beijing says the region has developed considerably under its rule. But rights groups say China continues to violate human rights, accusing Beijing of political and religious oppression - something Beijing denies.",A New York City Police Department officer has been charged with acting as an illegal agent for China.
"Celtic Array, the company behind the Rhiannon project, has just completed a second round of consultation events. Rhiannon would consist of about 440 turbines and would be situated 21 miles (34km) from the Isle of Man coast. A company spokesman said all the public comments gathered at the meetings will inform the planning application. She added: ""It was valuable to meet so many members of the local community, and to hear people's views on our proposals."" Celtic Array, a joint venture between Centrica and Danish company Dong Energy, is holding a public consultation on the proposals until 19 May. The development would comprise up to 440 turbines, eight offshore substations and four accommodation platforms.","Feedback from public meetings on a wind farm project off the coast of the Isle Man ""will be carefully considered"" in the planning process, say developers."
"Six out of 11 judges voted to consider discrimination against gays and transgender people equivalent to racism. The decision will give the community, which suffers constant attacks, real protection, activists say. At least 141 LGBT people have been killed in Brazil this year, according to rights group Grupo Gay da Bahia. The Catholic Church and the evangelical movement are frequently critical of gay rights and far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, elected last year with strong support of conservative voters, is a self-described homophobe. ""Homophobic crimes are as alarming as physical violence,"" Supreme Court Vice-President Luiz Fux said on his vote, citing ""epidemic levels of homophobic violence"". For almost 20 years there have been efforts to make homophobia a crime in Brazil, but legislation on the matter has faced resistance among conservative and religious groups in Congress, the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio reports. The decision at the Supreme Court means that offences are to be punished under the country's racism law until Congress approves specific legislation to protect LGBT people, our correspondent adds. The remaining judges will vote in a session scheduled for 5 June. Brazil has the world's biggest Catholic population but also a growing number of young, educated urban liberals who are eager to fight for gay and trans rights. The country legalised same-sex marriage in 2013 and LGBT couples have also been given the right to adopt. Last year, 420 LGBT people were killed across Brazil, one of the most violent countries in the world, according to Grupo Gay da Bahia. Some activists have raised concerns over the possibility of a rise in crimes against gays and transgender people with the election of Mr Bolsonaro, a deeply divisive figure who has also made racist and misogynist remarks. In previous interviews, he has said he would rather have a dead son than a homosexual son. Last month, he was heavily criticised for saying Brazil should not become a ""gay tourism paradise"".",A majority in Brazil's Supreme Court has voted in favour of making homophobia and transphobia crimes.
"The Isle of Man Health and Care Association said it ""broadly"" supported the changes outlined in Sir Jonathan Michael's recent review. Politicians approved all 26 recommendations in the report in May. They included the creation of a ""Manx Care"" body to deliver health services. A spokesman for IOMHACA said the debate showed ""at last some enthusiasm for positive change"". ""We strongly commend the need for independent governance"", he continued. Under the recommendations the development of future policy and strategy will remain within the health department, but practical healthcare will be delivered by the new organisation. IOMHACA said the group supported ""the notion of separating planning from service provision"", but the department would have to ""demonstrate the effectiveness of any changes made"". The charity said it also welcomed plans to create stronger links with specialist centres in the UK and enhance patient transfer services, both of which were recommended in the report. Former NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Sir Jonathan was appointed to review the delivery of health services in the island in March 2018, following a series of overspends by the health department. The changes are expected to take five years, and £5m has been allocated to cover the cost.","Plans to deliver health care services ""at arm's length"" from the Manx government have been cautiously welcomed by a charity representing patients."
"US PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA Gabby Giffords was a friend of mine. She is not only an extraordinary public servant, but she is also somebody who is warm and caring. It's not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does - listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbours. That is the essence of what our democracy is all about. That is why this is more than a tragedy for those involved. It is a tragedy for Arizona and a tragedy for our entire country. What Americans do at times of tragedy is to come together and support each other. So at this time I ask all Americans to join me and Michelle in keeping all the victims and their families, including Gabby, in our thoughts and prayers. JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER I am horrified by the senseless attack on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff. An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society. Our prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords, her staff, all who were injured, and their families. This is a sad day for our country. SARAH PALIN, FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR My sincere condolences are offered to the family of Rep Gabrielle Giffords and the other victims of today's tragic shooting in Arizona. On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice. NANCY PELOSI, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER This terrible act of violence is a national tragedy, and today is a very sad day for our country. Congresswoman Giffords is a brilliant and courageous member of Congress, bringing to Washington the views of a new generation of national leaders. It is especially tragic that she was attacked as she was meeting with her constituents whom she serves with such dedication and distinction. ERIC CANTOR, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER I was deeply horrified to learn today of the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others in Tucson. Our thoughts and prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords and her family, her staff, and the residents of Tucson on this sad day. As this serious situation continues to develop, I remain in close communication with Democratic leaders, the Speaker's office and the Sergeant at Arms. We will remain in constant communication regarding any schedule changes. MITCH MCCONNELL, SENATE MINORITY LEADER This senseless attack today in Tucson is a national tragedy, and all America mourns those who lost their lives in the very act of public service. I join the entire Congress in condemning this horrifying act of violence, and on behalf of the entire Senate family, Elaine and I extend our deepest expressions of sympathy and heartfelt prayers to Rep Giffords and the families of those who have been killed or injured. JOHN MCCAIN, ARIZONA SENATOR I am horrified by the violent attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords and many other innocent people by a wicked person who has no sense of justice or compassion. I pray for Gabby and the other victims, and for the repose of the souls of the dead and comfort for their families. I beg our loving Creator to spare the lives of those who are still alive, heal them in body and spirit, and return them to their loved ones. Whoever did this, whatever their reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, this country and the human race, and they deserve and will receive the contempt of all decent people and the strongest punishment of the law. ERIC HOLDER, US ATTORNEY GENERAL Today's tragedy in Arizona was a senseless act of violence that has already resulted in devastating loss, including the death of Chief United States District Court Judge John Roll and four other individuals and the wounding of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and a number of others.... FBI Director Mueller is traveling to Arizona to help coordinate the investigation. The FBI is working jointly with local law enforcement to investigate today's events, and I have directed Department prosecutors and law enforcement officials to use every resource necessary to investigate this tragedy. I want to assure the people of Arizona and every American that we will hold accountable anyone responsible for these heinous acts. JAN BREWER, ARIZONA GOVERNOR I am just heartbroken. Gabby is more than just a colleague, she's actually a friend. She's always been a noble public servant. AMY KREMER, CHAIRMAN OF TEA PARTY EXPRESS GROUP These heinous crimes have no place in America and they are especially grievous when committed against our elected officials. Spirited debate is desirable in our country but it only should be the clash of ideas. An attack on anyone for political purposes, if that was a factor in this shooting, is an attack on the democratic process. We join with everyone in vociferously condemning it. DAVID CAMERON, UK PRIME MINISTER Like everyone in Britain, I was shocked and saddened by the shootings which took place yesterday in Tucson, Arizona. Our hearts go out to all of those who have been caught up in this terrible incident. That such an attack should have taken place against a member of Congress as she was meeting her constituents in a shopping centre on a Saturday morning is especially shocking to all of us who believe in democracy. I am keeping Representative Giffords in my thoughts and prayers as she battles for life, together with all of those who have been wounded.","US politicians have been responding to the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was attacked while meeting constituents in Tucson. Members of her staff were among up to 18 people who were also shot."
"The Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) hit 401 at 12:00 on Friday (04:00 GMT) - the highest in Singapore's history. The index also reached 400 in one part of Indonesia, which is readying helicopters and cloud-seeding equipment in an effort to tackle the fires. Indonesia has said it is unfair to blame it solely for the forest fires. A senior official in the Indonesian president's office said fires had been spotted on land owned by 32 companies in the region, some of them based in Malaysia and Singapore. Schools in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia have closed temporarily. Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong warned on Thursday that the haze could remain in place for weeks. ""We can't tell how this problem is going to develop because it depends on the burning, it depends on the weather, it depends on the wind,"" he said. ""It can easily last for several weeks and quite possibly it could last longer until the dry season ends in Sumatra which may be September or October."" 'Life threatening' A PSI reading above 300 is defined as ""hazardous"", while Singapore government guidelines say a PSI reading of above 400 sustained for 24 hours ""may be life-threatening to ill and elderly persons"". ""Healthy people [may also] experience adverse symptoms that affect normal activity,"" the government says. The PSI dropped down to 143 at 17:00 (09:00 GMT), although this is still classed as ""unhealthy"". Before this week's episode, the previous air pollution record was from September 1997 during the 1997-1998 South East Asian Haze, when the PSI peaked at 226. Singapore resident Nicole Wu told the BBC that she had stayed indoors for the past two days. ""It's terrible. In my flat the windows are all closed with the air conditioning on,"" she said. ""My mother has to wear a mask to go shopping."" ""I can't even see what's happening outside my house due to the smog. You can't see birds [or] moving objects,"" she added. Philip Koh, a doctor, told AFP news agency that the number of medical consultations he had had in the past week had increased by 20%. ""My patients are telling me they are worried about how long this is going to last and how much higher this is going to go,"" he said. In Indonesia's Riau province, where the fires are concentrated, the PSI reached 400 on Friday, the head of the local health office told the BBC. Schools there are to remain closed until the air quality improves. The chief of the health department Zainal Arifin said there was an ""increasing number of asthma, lung, eye and skin problems due to higher CO2 levels"". ""I call for residents to stay at home and reduce outdoor activities,"" he said. Diplomatic strain Singapore's National Environment Agency has started providing hourly PSI updates on its website, in addition to the three-hourly updates it previously provided. Around 300 schools in southern Malaysia have now been closed as a result of the smog. Schools in Singapore are currently closed for the holidays. There are also reports of flight delays affecting both Singapore's Changi airport and Riau province in Indonesia. The fires are caused by illegal slash-and-burn land clearance in Sumatra, to the west of Singapore. The smog has strained diplomatic relations between Singapore and Indonesia - two countries that usually share good relations, the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Jakarta reports. Mr Lee said Singapore had provided satellite date to Indonesia to help it identify companies involved and said that if any Singapore firms were involved, that would be addressed. Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency said it would deploy two helicopters to conduct ""water-bombing"" operations, as well as planes with cloud seeding equipment. One of the Malaysian companies named by the Indonesian presidential official denied that it was burning forest to clear land, but said some small farmers operating on its property were doing so. Palm oil giant Sime Darby said in a statement that it was strictly following its zero-burning policy throughout its operations, but that it could not control the activities of local growers farming on its concession area. More than 100 Indonesian firefighters are attempting to put out the fires in Sumatra. However, an official in Riau province said they were ""overwhelmed and in a state of emergency"". ""We have been fighting fires 24 hours a day for two weeks,"" Ahmad Saerozi, the head of the natural resources conservation agency in Riau, told AFP news agency. He added that the fires were in peat around three or four metres below the ground, making it particularly hard to fight them. ""It is still burning under the surface so we have to stick a hose into the peat to douse the fire,"" he said. ""We take one to two hours to clear a hectare, and by then another fire has started elsewhere."" Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said ""all the country's resources"" would be mobilised to extinguish the fires.","Pollution levels soared for a third day in a row in Singapore, as smoky haze from fires in Indonesia shrouded the city state."
"The 2016 Presidential candidate made the comments in an interview with CBS that also discussed the confirmation of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh who was accused of sexual harassment. Mrs Clinton also told CBS that she believes it was right that her husband, who was 49 at the time, did not resign from office, and that Ms Lewinsky ""was an adult"". The frank remarks on the scandal are being interpreted in the context of the year-old #MeToo movement that caused numerous high-profile men to resign after accusations of sexual assault and harassment. Former President Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury and later acquitted by Congress in 1998 after lying about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky. Mrs Clinton's comments contradict Ms Lewinsky's characterisation of the relationship. Many on social media disagree with Mrs Clinton, suggesting instead that her husband's position as President and Ms Lewinsky's role as young White House intern define an abuse of power. ""She was a 22-year-old intern and he was the President of the United States. It's honestly hard to think of a dynamic that is *more* clearly an egregious abuse of power,"" wrote lawyer Lindsey Barrett on Twitter. American columnist Kristen Powers tweeted, ""This actually shouldn't be so hard. Hillary isn't responsible for what her husband did, but she should be able to recognise it as an abuse of power."" In March, Monica Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair that she considered the affair ""a gross abuse of power"", adding ""he was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet"". She had previously described their relationship as ""consensual"" and said any abuse came from the aftermath of the political scandal. Others online commented that Mrs Clinton's remarks undermine progress made by the #MeToo movement in which claims of sexual assault and harassment are taken more seriously. ""In one statement she undercut the abuse of power and position against almost all sexual harassment in the workplace,"" tweeted author David Rothkopf.. However others defended Mrs Clinton's view, highlighting Ms Lewinsky's consent to the relationship. ""Why is it abuse of power if the intern is a willing participant? I can think of many more obvious examples of abuse of power,"" wrote one Twitter user, while another added ""A 22-year-old is perfectly capable of making their own decisions."" The debate highlights a key fault line in the #MeToo movement about whether young women in consensual relationships with powerful men are being ""victimised"" and ""infantilised"" by describing their relations as abusive. Others questioned why Mrs Clinton is being held accountable for her husband's behaviour, suggesting it was sexist. ""I wish the media would spend more time pressing Bill Clinton for answers on his own actions than they spend asking Hillary Clinton,"" wrote another Twitter user @_celia_bedelia. ""She had nothing to do with it, it was his affair. It was TWENTY years ago. Why keep bringing up an affair from 20 years ago? (We know why but ugh),"" added another. Some drew attention to Mrs Clinton's response to the CBS journalist that asked why there isn't more investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump. Mrs Clinton's comments come less than a month before the midterm elections in the US. By Georgina Rannard, UGC & Social News","After Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that her husband's affair in 1998 with 22-year-old intern Monica Lewinsky was not ""an abuse of power"", many online have been debating her view."
"By Regan MorrisBBC News, Los Angeles The bridesmaid was a known transgendered activist in a Chinese-style gown of red and gold - ""for good luck"" - and the mayor of West Hollywood performed the ceremony. But even by the ""anything goes"" West Hollywood standard, the wedding was unusual. The seven couples married in the mass wedding were all from China - the winners of a contest meant to promote the rights of gay people to marry in China and around the world. 'Astronomical progress' More than 2,000 couples applied to the ""We Do"" contest hosted by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Gay marriage is not legal in China, but there is a growing gay rights movement. ""The progress that's been made in terms of gay rights, for want of a better word, in China has been astronomical,"" said Geng Le, the CEO of Chinese gay dating app Blued, which has 15 million members. ""In fact, when Ireland recently voted on the same sex referendum, it was reported on the national media in China. So the progress has been pretty quick."" Charlie Gu, of China Luxury Advisors, organised the wedding in West Hollywood. Mr Gu's job is to help luxury brands market to the growing number of Chinese travellers and consumers. ""For a company like Alibaba there is also a strong business interest in this,"" Mr Gu said of the mass wedding. ""When you look at companies like Google and Apple all stepping up their game to embrace marriage equality and support this cause, Alibaba as a publicly traded company in the United States certainly wanted to elevate their status and their participating in the global business community and be part of it - do the right thing."" 'Incomplete without a diamond' The wedding was held Tuesday morning at the West Hollywood public library. It was a solemn and emotional event, with the couples walking the short aisle through the library auditorium to sit in seats until it was their turn on stage. They walked the aisle to the tune of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and each wedding took just a few moments. The sponsors sprung for platinum Tiffany rings for the couples. But Rongfeng Duan, 38, of Shanghai had other plans. Coco Lachine - the bridesmaid - brought the Tiffany ring to him and West Hollywood Mayor Lindsey Horvath asked him to place the ring on Tao Li's finger. But Mr Duan solicited gasps and then applause from the small crowd when he said: ""No thanks, I have another."" He had another Tiffany ring. A gold one with diamonds. Mr Li broke down in tears and afterward couldn't stop admiring his sparkly new ring as the other couples were getting married. ""It cannot be complete without a diamond,"" Mr Duan said after the wedding. ""We already got the support from family and friends including the red envelopes [full of money] which is a tradition in China."" Mr Duan and Mr Li, the couple who wore the lime green and moustache ties, say they have matching red suits to wear for a reception their mothers are hosting for them in Shanghai to celebrate the marriage once they get home. Gay marriage may not be legal in China, but it's becoming easier to be gay, they said. ""Unfortunately, it is still the case today that for the LGBT community in China, they are unable to walk down the aisle with the person they love,"" Mr Le of Blued said to the wedding party. ""These seven couples are also represented of the entire Chinese LGBT community. Another reason we brought them to LA - we want to showcase to the community back in China what it can really be like."" 'Demonstrating love' To win the contest, couples had to submit a video sharing their love stories to Taobao, an online marketplace owned by Alibaba, which is similar to Amazon or eBay (and sells more than them both combined). The public then voted on winners and 10 couples were selected. Only seven made the trip to California because the other three couples had visa problems. Aside from the wedding, the couples were treated to tours of Los Angeles, shopping trips and various dinners out on the town. After the ceremony, the couples wiped away their tears as they posed for group photos with the mayor and the bridesmaid. Mayor Horvath, who is just 32 and has been mayor for just two months, said she considers it her job to fight for gay marriage around the world. ""I do believe that today's occasion not only helps to demonstrates the love and commitment all couples share but to let those people who want to shut us down and take away the rights and privileges of these couples that we will not stop,"" she said, ""until all love can be celebrated equally under the law"".","The two brides wore white and the 12 grooms wore suits, two in lime green with matching moustache-adorned bow ties."
"Earlier authorities had blamed a banned Islamist party, citing an alleged confession of one arrested suspect. Two Americans, a Swiss and a Dutch national were hit by a car in Danghara, south-east of the capital Dushanbe. The attackers then stabbed their victims. Two other foreigners were injured. Earlier on Tuesday, Tajikistan's interior ministry said that a man suspected of leading the attack was an active member of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT), which was outlawed three years ago. Exiled leaders of the IRPT denied any link to the attack, saying the authorities were trying to use the incident for political purposes, Reuters reports. Tajikistan's government banned the IRPT in 2015, accusing it of planning a coup. The video released by IS shows five young men seated under a tree in a mountainous area with the IS flag in the background, BBC Monitoring reports. One denounces the rulers of Tajikistan as ""apostates"", who ""sold their religion"" and allowed the country to be occupied by ""unbelievers"". They later join hands and swear loyalty to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, before pledging to attack ""unbelievers"". The identity of the men and whether it was they who carried out the attack cannot as yet be verified. IS efforts in Central Asia By Mina Al-Lami, BBC Monitoring IS isn't known to have a presence in Tajikistan. However, the group has had members from the country, and from other Central Asian states. Tajik authorities have in the past arrested alleged IS recruiters or sympathisers. In May 2015, a former member of Tajikistan's special OMON police unit, Gulmurod Khalimov, pledged allegiance to IS and migrated to territory held by the group. This was flaunted in an IS-linked video in an effort to inspire others in Tajikistan to follow his example. In February 2018, IS said its attacks in Russia and former Soviet countries had entered a new phase, inciting sympathisers to attack Christians in ""the Caucasus, Crimea, and Central Asia countries"". ""The current stage"", said IS via its weekly newspaper al-Naba, ""does not require groups with big numbers of trained fighters, nor heavy weapons. Rather, it requires a mujahid to use whatever weapon he can get his hands on"" to attack. Such attacks, it said, would instil fear in Christians and prompt them to leave these countries. Following Monday's attack, four suspects were killed by authorities in a special operation, the interior ministry said. Another four were arrested, and a damaged car believed to have been involved was recovered. An amateur video which appears to be of the attack captures the moment a car is driven into unsuspecting cyclists. According to Tajikistan's interior minister, three of the tourists died instantly and one on the way to a nearby hospital. ""One had knife wounds, he received medical help, now his condition is stable,"" Ramazon Hamro Rahimzoda told reporters. The victims were on a tour in the Central Asian country with three other tourists from France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Tajikistan has struggled with poverty and instability since the former Soviet republic became independent in 1991. It had declared 2018 a ""year of tourism"", AFP news agency said.",The Islamic State (IS) group has released a video purporting to show a group of men who killed four foreign cyclists in Tajikistan on Sunday pledging allegiance to its cause.
"Europol says the victims were kept in ""squalid conditions in caves"" and intimidated with voodoo threats. Gang members forced the women into paid sex in order to pay off a 30,000 euro ($37,000; £26,000) debt. Eighty-nine people, including a famous but as yet unnamed Nigerian DJ, have been arrested. The DJ is said to have helped move victims to Spain and organise sexual exploitation across the country. He was caught flying back into Spain after recording a music video. Investigations began when an underage victim filed a complaint with the police, saying she had been pressured into trafficking by voodoo threats made in Nigeria. Along with other victims, the girl was transferred from Nigeria to Spain via Libya and Italy. The operation, which was carried out with police from the UK and Nigeria, is one of the biggest trafficking busts in Europe, says Europol. 'A major blow, but not the end' By Sam Piranty BBC News After our investigation in 2016, the UK's National Crime Agency flew to Barcelona to meet Mossos, the Catalan police, who conducted the investigation into the Supreme Eiye Confraternity (SEC). Information was passed over and the NCA, alongside partners in Madrid, conducted further investigation into the group, leading to these arrests. This is a major blow to the SEC, but by no means the end. We know the group have cells, or nests as SEC called them, across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The group regularly moves women and narcotics between different cities in Europe depending on demand. We know that SEC is back at work in Barcelona, and given time, they will be sure to continue their work in the UK and the rest of Spain. This is an international network with connections across three continents and without more international cooperation like that between the NCA and Spanish police, the group will continue to thrive.

"By Natalio CosoyBBC Mundo, Bogota Only Afghanistan has higher numbers of landmine victims, Colombian government figures suggest. Many of the mines have been planted by Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), during the 50-year armed conflict with the government. As part of peace negotiations currently under way in Cuba, the Farc recently agreed to work with the Colombian security forces to clear the mines. Risky task The guerrilla group says it will identify the locations of mines they planted so that specialised army unit, of which there are 2,100, can remove them. It is a highly dangerous and complicated task, explains Sgt Martinez Beltran, who has worked in mine clearance for 17 years. ""Your first mistake when dealing with explosives is also your last one,"" he says. Slow progress The unit of four soldiers he commands can spend a whole day removing just one mine - or up to 12 on good day. They first try to spot trip wires and other possible triggers. One soldier then repeatedly throws into the minefield a heavy weight made from special explosive-resistant material. The weight is attached to a 70m-long (230ft) rope and as he pulls it back, it detonates any mine it comes across. A specially trained dog and its handler then go into the field to identify explosive substances that cannot be found with a metal detector. ""There's no risk for the dog because we check for trip wires beforehand,"" Sgt Alvaro Martinez Beltran explains. Two soldiers then check the terrain with a metal detector. Any unexploded devices are then detonated by the sergeant. Hunting for mines The soldiers are well trained and highly skilled, but locating a minefield in Colombia's varied terrain, which ranges from dense jungle to high mountains is no easy task. This is where the contribution of the Farc will be key, believes Lt Col David Navia, who commands 120 soldiers that work in mine clearance. In 2014 his team deactivated 28 minefields, with some 220 explosive devices in them. ""If (the Farc) provide us with the exact location of the mines this whole process will be much faster,"" he says. But the new plan is not without its problems. Many of the Farc explosive experts who knew where the mines had been placed have been killed in combat. To complicate matters further, many mines have been shifted by heavy rains and will no longer be where they were originally laid. Decades of work Oscar Naranjo thinks the country could be cleared of mines within 10 years. Gen Naranjo is the former chief of the Colombian police and was named Post-conflict Minister last year, in charge of advising the government on the disarmament and demobilisation of the rebels. But others think he is being too optimistic and it could take up to five decades before Colombia can be declared mine-free. They point to Nicaragua, a country which is much smaller than Colombia, and which took two decades to clear its territory of mines. Even if every device planted by the Farc can be found and removed, those laid by Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group will still remain. The National Liberation Army continues to fight the government and is unlikely to reveal the location of its mines in the near future. And it is not just the guerrilla groups which have planted explosive devices. It is also a strategy used by the country's many criminal groups to protect their territory. Clearing the country of mines will also be costly. According to the director of the NGO Colombian Campaign to Ban Landmines, Alvaro Jimenez Millan, it will cost ""many millions of dollars"". Nevertheless Mr Jimenez is still optimistic. ""This agreement is the first one coming out of the [Havana negotiation] table that will mean a real change in the lives of people living in the [highly mined] territories,"" he says.","More than 11,000 people have been killed or maimed by landmines in Colombia over the past 25 years."
"While the country is renowned for these and other delights, it is also notorious for its precarious political life, and has had several dozen governments since the end of the Second World War. The Italian political landscape underwent a seismic shift in the early 1990s when the ""mani pulite"" (""clean hands"") operation exposed corruption at the highest levels of politics and big business. Several former prime ministers were implicated and thousands of businessmen and politicians were investigated. There were high hopes at the time that the scandal would give rise to a radical reform of Italian political culture, but these hopes were dashed when the old structures were replaced by a new political landscape dominated by the multi-millionaire businessman Silvio Berlusconi, who himself became increasingly mired in scandals and corruption affairs. More recently, populist parties have made the political running, and formed a coalition government in 2018.

He was little known to the general public, but is a respected figure in political circles after a 25-year parliamentary career and several stints as minister in governments of left and right. Prime minister: Giuseppe Conte Giuseppe Conte was sworn in in June 2018 as prime minister of Western Europe's first populist government, whose aim was to cut taxes, boost welfare spending and overhaul European Union rules on budgets and immigration. Mr Conte, a law professor, was the choice of the far-right League and the radical 5-Star Movement, which formed a governing coalition and ended three months of political deadlock following inconclusive elections. In August 2019, League leader Matteo Salvini withdrew from the government in the hope of triggering early elections and boosting his party's position in parliament. But the 5-Star Movement and centre-left Democratic Party frustrated this plan by agreeing a new coalition without the League, with Giuseppe Conte retaining his position as prime minister. MEDIA Italy's heady blend of politics and media has often made headlines at home and abroad, with concern regularly being expressed over the concentration of media ownership in the hands of one man - former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Mr Berlusconi's Mediaset empire operates Italy's top private TV stations, and the public broadcaster, Rai, has traditionally been subject to political influence, so that when Mr Berlusconi was prime minister, he was able to exert tight control over both public and private broadcasting. Between them, Rai and Mediaset dominate Italy's TV market and are a potentially powerful political tool, especially as 80% of the population is said to rely on television for its daily news - the highest percentage in the EU.

"Police chief Sok Phal said the decision to expel Gottfrid Svartholm Warg came after Swedish officials presented documents on the case against him. Warg was held in Phnom Penh after an international warrant was issued against him by his native Sweden. Sweden acted after he failed to show up for the start of his one-year jail term for copyright violations. Cambodia and Sweden do not have an extradition treaty, so it is unclear to which country he will be deported. ""We will deport him based on our immigration law,"" police spokesman Kirth Chantharith said. ""We just know we will deport him. As to which country, that would be up to the Swedish side."" He added that no date had been set yet for the deportation. Damages Warg and the site's other founders - Fredrik Neij and Peter Sunde, as well financier Carl Lundstroem - were convicted by a Swedish court of encouraging copyright violations in 2009 despite arguing that the website acted within the law. Neij, Sunde and Lundstroem all had their one-year jail terms reduced to between four and 10 months following an appeal in 2010. They were also ordered to pay nearly $7m (£4m) in damages for copyright infringement to music and movie companies. However, Warg did not attend the appeal hearing, with his lawyer saying that he was too ill. The Swedish court then decided to uphold his sentence.

"Malta's PM said the Lifeline would arrive on Wednesday, after his country and seven other EU states agreed to take a share of those on board. Joseph Muscat added that genuine asylum seekers would be allowed to stay. Italy's new government has closed its ports to rescue ships operated by charities in the Mediterranean. The dispute over the Lifeline echoes that which surrounded the Aquarius, whose 630 migrants were finally taken to the Spanish port of Valencia last week, after being blocked by Italy and Malta. Mr Muscat said on Wednesday: ""I believe the vessel will reach our shores this evening."" Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland, Belgium and France had also agreed to receive some of the migrants, he added. The ship is currently off Malta's east coast. On Tuesday night, the NGO Mission Lifeline said it had not been given permission to enter Malta's territory. Early on Wednesday, it tweeted that it had entered Maltese waters with permission, to shelter from bad weather. Mr Muscat also said the vessel would be impounded pending an investigation. The Maltese authorities suspect the captain defied an Italian order to let the Libyan coastguard pick up the migrants. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said France would take in ""a few dozen individuals"", but also said the Lifeline had ""acted against all rules"". Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini told the BBC that illegal migrants were risking their lives by making the journey. A sick passenger was evacuated to Malta from the Lifeline on Monday night. The German charity Mission Lifeline tweeted that conditions were worsening for the migrants on board. Meanwhile, 108 migrants have been taken ashore in Italy from a Danish container ship. The Alexander Maersk was allowed to dock in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo. EU leaders face tough negotiations on the migrant crisis at a Brussels summit on Thursday. Read more on the migrant crisis: More than 600,000 migrants have come ashore in Italy since 2014 - the highest Mediterranean influx.

They also argue that people fleeing war and persecution have a right to asylum. In recent years refugees from Syria, Iraq and other war zones have headed for the EU. Italy - the destination for most of the migrants from North Africa - wants EU penalties for countries refusing to accept a quota system. The Visegrad Group - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - refuse to take in any migrants from other EU states. Mr Salvini, on a visit to Libya on Monday, called for migrant processing centres to be set up in African countries - an idea also backed by France.

"Special representative Zalmay Khalilzad said he held a working lunch with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar before ""moving on to talks"". Mullah Baradar was recently released from a Pakistani prison. His presence in Qatar is thought to improve the chances of a deal. Last month's US-Taliban talks in Qatar made progress in ending 17 years of conflict in Afghanistan, the US said. US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said the January talks had been ""more productive than they have been in the past"" but added there were a number of issues still to work out. He said a ""draft framework"" of a peace deal had been agreed, based on commitments by the US to withdraw international forces from Afghanistan, and from the Taliban not to allow jihadist groups to operate in the country. The Taliban also said progress had been made in the negotiations. However, a spokesman added that talks about ""unsolved matters"" would continue. The Taliban have so far refused to hold direct talks with Afghan officials, whom they dismiss as ""puppets"". They say they will only begin negotiations with the government once a firm date for the withdrawal of US troops has been agreed. Mullah Baradar, a deputy to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhunzada, was put in charge of the Taliban political office in Qatar in January but until now has remained in Pakistan and has not made any public appearances. He served in a number of key roles within the Taliban, until he was detained by Pakistani authorities in 2010. A senior Taliban figure told the BBC that Mullah Baradar's authority within the group to make decisions could help ""speed up the peace process"". Mr Khalilzad has suggested this is the case. He tweeted that he was this time meeting ""with a more authoritative Taliban delegation"", adding that it ""could be a significant moment"". After last month's talks, Taliban sources told the BBC that the two sides had agreed to form committees to address two key issues in detail: the withdrawal of foreign forces and how the Taliban would in turn implement a commitment to prevent groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State from using Afghanistan as a base in future. Obstacles ahead by Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan correspondent, in Doha Mullah Baradar isn't the only senior figure from the group attending the talks in Doha for the first time. Also here is Amir Khan Motaqi, chief of staff to the Taliban supreme leader. Their presence seems to indicate how seriously the Taliban are taking these discussions. But there are still major obstacles ahead. It seems Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's administration is being deliberately sidelined by the Taliban who have so far refused to talk to them. Yet it's hard to see how a deal could be done without their involvement. The absence of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government also means there's been no official discussion of what a post-peace Afghanistan would look like. Would it be a democracy? Would women have the same rights they have now? There's an argument that while progress has been made, so far the Taliban are yet to make any major concessions. Their promise not to allow other jihadists to operate in Afghanistan isn't new. American officials will hope this beefed up Taliban negotiating team will have the authority and willingness to show some flexibility. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said more than 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he became leader in 2014. It is estimated that about 15 million people - half the Afghan population - are living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the militants are openly present and regularly mount attacks. On Sunday UN figures showed that more civilians were killed last year in Afghanistan than at any time since records began. In December, reports emerged that the US was planning to withdraw about 7,000 troops - roughly half the remaining US military presence in the country. Analysts warned that such a withdrawal could offer the Taliban a propaganda victory. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, shortly before the demise of the Soviet Union. The militants ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, imposing a brutal version of Islamic law that included public executions and amputations, and the banning of women from public life. They were driven from power by US-led troops following the 9/11 attacks which Washington blamed on al-Qaeda militants sheltered by the Taliban.","The top US envoy seeking to broker peace in Afghanistan has met one of the Taliban's co-founders for the first time, as the latest round of talks get under way in Qatar."
"The Human Rights Commission report focused on the Villawood detention centre in Sydney. Some detainees thought often of suicide and self-harm, and some had swallowed detergents and chemicals, it said. It comes a day after the UN human rights commissioner attacked Australia's tough refugee policies. Navi Pillay called for an end to mandatory detention and spoke of a ""racist"" undercurrent in Australia. She has also been critical of Australian politicians for demonising asylum seekers for domestic political gain. Violation Australia's Human Rights Commission condemned the treatment of asylum seekers at the Villawood detention centre, noting that their prolonged detention was causing serious mental problems. It noted that some detainees sewed their lips together in protest at their treatment. Commission president Catherine Branson said: ""What we saw at Villawood was the result of the system of mandatory and indefinite detention, where people can see no end in sight because there is no set time limit on the period a person can be held in detention,"" she said. Over the past nine months there have been six deaths in Australia's detention centre network, five of which appeared to be suicide. In the past six weeks there have also been two major riots, first at the Christmas Island offshore detention centre in the Indian Ocean and then at Villawood in Sydney. But the Commission's call for an end to mandatory detention is unlikely to happen since the Labor government is sensitive to the opposition charge that it has been soft on border protection - a major issue in Australian politics, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney. Meanwhile, Australia's Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd has defended a controversial deal that will allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to be transferred to Malaysia for processing. Under the swap deal, up to 800 new boat arrivals to Australia will be relocated to Malaysia; in return, Australia will accept 4,000 people registered refugees living in Malaysia. Ms Pillay said the proposed deal potentially violates refugee law. Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention. But Mr Rudd said the plan had backing from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Office of Migration. ""The key thing is we're taking kids out of mandatory detention, we are making sure that processing times are accelerated so that once basic checks are undertaken there is a way through this,"" he said. ""We are also making sure there are proper and humane conditions.""","Australia's human rights watchdog has called for an end to the mandatory detention of asylum seekers, citing suicides, riots and depression."
"Clothes have long communicated more than just comfort or class in Indonesia, a vast and diverse nation with a mix of languages, cultures and religions. So it is perhaps unsurprising that politicians have also turned to sartorial branding to distinguish themselves. Political plaid began in 2012 in Jakarta when Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, (with the microphone), successfully ran for governor with running mate Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. The shirts gave the reformist pair a more informal, hardworking look than the batik shirts often worn by traditional politicians. It is also said to have appealed to trendy young voters - a huge electoral force in Indonesia. When Jokowi became president in 2014, Mr Purnama, popularly known as Ahok, took over the governorship and a similar political wardrobe. The shirt has featured prominently in his campaign for governorship elections, taking place on 15 February. He typically wears it with the sleeves rolled up, as though he is about to get to work, which does nothing to diminish his reputation as a hands-on governor, not afraid to get out of the office and take charge when officials are not up to the job. The look has been adopted by his supporters, who turn up at rallies in versions of the shirt. But candidates and running mates co-ordinating their look is common in Indonesia. One of Mr Purnama's main rivals for the Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (left), a candidate for the Jakarta governorship and son of a former president, and his deputy Sylviana Murni, routinely wear black. Candidate Anies Baswedan (right) and his running mate Sandiaga Uno prefer white shirts, here combined with traditional songkok hats. Both items are conservative symbols, usually worn by devout Muslims, a demographic Mr Baswedan has courted during campaigning. The choices are insignificant in an election that has been overshadowed by religious social tensions. Mr Purnama is ethnically Chinese and a Christian, the first non-Muslim to hold the governor's post in 50 years. He is currently on trial for blasphemy, after telling voters that religious leaders who said the Koran told them not to vote for a non-Muslim leader were misleading them. Huge protests, led by hardline Islamists, have demanded he be punished, some even calling for his execution, while leaders have urged Muslims to choose one of the Muslim candidate. The role of Jakarta governor is often seen a springboard to the presidency, so the election is being closely watched across the country. Voters will find out later this month whether they will have a city leader clad in black, white or hipster checks.","With a sea of young people in checked shirts before him, Jakarta's governor might have been mistaken for a rock star in another country. But the hipsters' favourite clothing item has become a political symbol in the capital of Indonesia, as the BBC's Simeon Paterson explains."

Mr Fillon, 63, faces accusations that he arranged for his wife to be paid public money for work as his parliamentary assistant amid claims that: He is also being investigated over payments to his two children, Marie and Charles, when he was a senator. Mr Fillon has said his children were paid as lawyers for specific tasks, but neither was a qualified lawyer at the time. In all, Mr Fillon is suspected of diverting public funds, complicity in misappropriating funds, receiving the funds and not declaring assets fully. There are also questions about a job Mrs Fillon had at a literary magazine owned by a billionaire friend of the couple, for which she allegedly did little or no actual work.","The wife of French presidential candidate François Fillon has been placed under formal investigation amid the continuing ""fake jobs"" inquiry."
"About 700 candidates - including model Gigi Hadid - were screened over the course of two weeks before a group of seven men and five women were picked. Mr Weinstein faces five charges, including rape and sexual assault. The trial will begin on Wednesday in New York. The 67-year-old has denied all charges, saying the encounters were consensual. He could face life in prison if convicted. Once one of Hollywood's most decorated and lauded producers, more than 80 women have accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct - allegations which helped drive the #MeToo movement. However, few of the complaints have led to criminal charges and in the New York case he faces charges related to allegations made by two women. Judge James Burke told potential jurors on Thursday that the trial was ""not a referendum on the #MeToo movement"", and that they were expected to decide Mr Weinstein's fate ""on the evidence"". The trial is expected to conclude in early March. Mr Weinstein was also charged with an additional count of rape and one of sexual assault in Los Angeles earlier this month, which he also denies. Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey has said she expects Mr Weinstein to appear in court in California in that case, saying he could be extradited or could come voluntarily after the conclusion of the New York trial.",Lawyers have chosen the 12 jurors who will sit in the trial of former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
"Dan Hubert of Island Waste accused the States of having a ""silo mentality"" after being told to erect a shed over his recycling yard in St Andrew. He said the £1.5m cost would prevent him taking on a contract to sort waste. The director of environmental health said the decision to insist on a shed was fair to nearby residents. Val Cameron said regulations had been brought in, in 2010, ""to protect human health and the environment"". ""The conditions that have been applied are fair in relation to the actual nuisance being posed,"" she said. Later this year, the States will go out to tender for companies to provide the waste recycling facilities at Longue Hougue in St Sampson, that will be necessary to enact the waste strategy adopted in February. This calls for 70% of household waste to be recycled by 2025. Earlier this year, the figure stood at 46.4%. Mr Hubert said it was well known that he wanted to win such a contract and move his firm to St Sampson. He said he was ""perplexed"" therefore, at the timing of the insistence on a new facility at his existing site.",The owner of a Guernsey waste recycling firm says complying with environmental health laws may stop him bidding to be part of the States' waste strategy.
"Marcelo Odebrecht was convicted of paying more than $30m (£21m) in bribes to Petrobras officials in exchange for contracts and influence. The Odebrecht group is Latin America's biggest construction conglomerate. The Petrobras inquiry has led to proceedings against dozens of business executives and ruling party figures. Last week former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, also from the governing Worker's Party, was detained and questioned for his alleged role in the affair. Lula, 70, is suspected of receiving about 30m reais ($8m; £5.6m) in speaking fees and donations to his charity, the Lula Institute. The party has held the Brazilian presidency since 2003, both under Lula and his successor Dilma Rousseff. Odebrecht was one of Brazil's richest and most powerful businessmen - with close relations to many top politicians, the BBC's Daniel Gallas reports from Sao Paulo. He was found guilty of money laundering, corruption and taking part in a criminal association. He had been in prison since last June and stepped down last December from the firm - which was founded by his family. The firm built major projects across the continent and in Africa and before the scandal had 181,000 employees in 21 countries. The corruption scandal has cost Petrobras over $16bn, including $2bn that went straight to corrupt executives and firms. Petrobras' investments alone represent 2% of Brazil's gross national product, and its downturn has harmed a national economy struggling as a result of low commodity prices.",A Brazilian construction tycoon has been jailed for 19 years over a corruption scandal involving the state oil company Petrobras.
"The BBC's Vikas Pandey in Delhi and Aakriti Thapar in Mumbai take to the streets to find out how citizens are coping. 'My child has cancer, we can't buy food' Mahavir Singh, sitting outside Delhi's famed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), is the picture of despair. The farm labourer has travelled nearly 80km (49 miles) from his village with his mother and his 10-year-old son Mohit Kumar, who suffers from blood cancer. The trio had brought 5,000 rupees for the trip to cover food, travel and lodging expenses, only to find that most of their money is now effectively worthless. ""We are facing major problems. Auto-rickshaw drivers and hotels are not accepting 500 rupee notes and that is all I have. It's been such a struggle to feed my family, and my son will have to sleep on the pavement tonight,"" he told the BBC. His mother, Pushpa Devi, says they have already spent all the 100 rupee notes they have. ""I have heard that there are some people who come here every evening to distribute food as charity, so I am hoping we can have that for dinner."" 'I have no customers' Sameer, who owns a roadside clothes shop along Mumbai's busy Linking road, says that he has had next to no customers all day. ""You can see, there is no one here,"" he says. ""Those who do come in try purchasing a cheap item with their 500 and 1,000 rupee notes and then asking us for change since the ATMs are shut. But we are not accepting those notes. ""In the long run this is going to affect our business badly as we only deal in cash."" 'You tell me what to do with this cash' Kalamuddin, a rickshaw puller in old Delhi, is angry. ""I am left with all this,"" he says, animatedly waving 500 rupee notes around. ""What will I do? I don't have any identity card or even a bank account. It's my hard-earned money. You tell me how I can prove that this is not black money."" Mr Kalamuddin's problem is likely to be a common one in India, which is overwhelmingly a cash economy and where many daily-wage labourers do not possess formal identification or bank accounts. 'A great move' Ranchor, who owns a convenience store in western Mumbai, says he is accepting 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from customers desperate to rid themselves of the now-banned currency. ""But we are not giving any change back. They have to purchase goods that are worth that amount. We will go to the bank and change those notes. ""This has benefited us because people are coming here as they can't go to the smaller local shops. This is a great move by the prime minister. It is time to crack down on black money."" Wedding woes Neeraj Bharadwaj, a jeweller in old Delhi, agrees it is important to bring ""black money"" back into the economy. But he says he is not sure about the way it was done. ""What are we going to do for the next few weeks? Our business is mainly during the wedding season, which starts in a few days. But now how are people going to buy gold and silver? They can only convert 4,000 rupees a day and that's not enough when you have a wedding to fund,"" he says. ""I pay all my taxes but I still mainly deal in cash. Now I am left with thousands of rupees worth of valueless notes. What am I going to do with them? Even if I change 4,000 rupees a day every day, it will take me months to convert all my money. I am educated and know what to do, but imagine the plight of a vegetable seller or milkman?"" 'Incredible India' Chiara Rossi, an Italian national who has been in India for six weeks, said the fiscal move had left her at a loss as to what to do with her foreign exchange. ""This is India and anything can happen but this is not fair. The government should have thought about tourists. I have 5,000 rupees and I am leaving India this evening. I don't know what to do with my money. It's frustrating.""","Indians are scrambling to adjust to life without 500 and 1,000 rupee notes after they were removed from public circulation in a shock announcement on Tuesday night. The move is part of a crackdown on corruption and illegal cash holdings."
"Cour du Parc in St Peter Port was vacated in February 2011 as the Housing Department deemed it unfit to house its mainly elderly tenants. Deputy Housing Minister Graham Guille said: ""We don't have endless staff resources... so something had to wait and I'm afraid it's been Cour du Parc."" Electors raised its disuse at hustings ahead of the election on 18 April. Deputy Guille said the block needed extensive work to make it habitable for any future tenants. Specialist workers Work includes making balconies safe, fixing the existing lift, installing a second lift and the replacement of the central heating system. Deputy Guille, who is not standing for election, said: ""We'd be delighted to get it back into operation but it's important that we do it in a way that gives the taxpayer value for money."" He said Housing was keen to see the building used by another department to accommodate specialist workers brought to the island on a housing license. The Public Services Department had been approached over housing airport project workers at the block but turned down the offer, he said. Jim Roberts, the director of housing services, said there was no guarantee the building would be refurbished. He said the department would continue to investigate ""whether it makes more sense to sell it and reinvest the money into the provision of social housing elsewhere"". But rather than determining the block's future, the department's top priority this year is a £55m investment in ""257 new homes for social rent, partial ownership and extra-care"".","The future of Guernsey's only tower block is still undecided, more than a year after tenants were moved out."
"By Lars BevangerBBC News, Oslo Vegard Groeslie Wennesland has donned his red Labour Party T-shirt for his last day of campaigning ahead of Norway's first parliamentary elections after extreme-right mass killer Anders Breivik's 2011 terror attacks. Handing out leaflets near Oslo's athletics stadium, Mr Wennesland reflected on what the attacks did to his views on politics. ""Someone tried to kill me and my comrades for what we believe in and that kind of stirs a feeling that it's important work you're doing. You can make a difference through politics - I'm more sure of that now than ever,"" he told the BBC. Vegard Groeslie Wennesland narrowly escaped Breivik's bullets at the Utoeya youth camp two years ago, but 69 of his fellow Labour youth members were shot dead. Yet people he meets on the campaign trail rarely mention what happened, he said. ""People see me as a regular candidate, and I'm glad for that. I don't want to be a survivor - I'm just a young guy who thinks he can get into parliament and make society a bit more fair."" Country turning to the right Anders Breivik said his bombing of government headquarters and shooting spree at the Labour youth camp was an attack on social democracy and multiculturalism. In the months after the attacks that killed a total of 77 people, support for the governing Labour Party grew and popularity ratings for Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg surged as he led the country through the shock and grief that followed. Backed by Norway's enormous oil and gas wealth, he also steered the country safely through the economic downturn. Yet now Mr Stoltenberg's centre-left coalition is set to be ousted by a Conservative-led centre-right group which includes the populist anti-immigration Progress Party, of which Anders Breivik was once a member. ""I think the key reason is a sort of fatigue with the sitting government. They've been in government for eight years, which is quite unique in recent history in this country,"" said Johannes Berg from the Institute of Social Research in Oslo. To gain a parliamentary majority, the opposition Conservative Party has for the first time said it would include the Progress Party in a coalition government, but only after the populists moved closer to the centre. ""After the terrorist attacks in 2011 the Progress Party moderated its rhetoric. Immigration became a non-issue,"" said Johannes Berg. ""The most extreme statements that they've made in the past they can't repeat now."" Progress Party leader Siv Jensen has previously talked about Norway suffering an ""Islamification through the backdoor"". Critics have said that is uncomfortably close to the rhetoric used by Anders Breivik, who warned of the Islamification of Norway. To Vegard Groeslie Wennesland and other Utoeya survivors now running for parliament, it has been important to remind people what they believe the Progress Party still stands for. ""They always pull this immigration card and try to stir up a conflict between immigrants and Norwegians,"" said Mr Wennesland. ""It's a rhetoric I despise, they are genuinely wrong. Immigration has been good for the economy and it's been good for Norwegian culture and Norwegian society. I feel like a much richer person when I can work with someone from a different culture."" Shift in focus Immigration still featured heavily in the Progress Party's manifesto, but a short tram ride from where Mr Wennesland was handing out Labour Party leaflets, Progress Party leader Siv Jensen was focusing on healthcare and infrastructure issues as she addressed her voters. When pressed, she denied claims that her party's rhetoric had echoes of Anders Breivik and other extreme-right elements. ""I completely disagree with that. The fact that we need a strict and firm immigration policy I think the majority of the Norwegian people agree with. And it has to do with another issue as well - we need to improve integration policies in Norway,"" Ms Jensen told the BBC. Immigrants make up 12% of Norway's population. Most come from Poland and Sweden and just 13% of new immigrants list Islam as their religion. The leader of the Conservative Party, Erna Solberg, who is widely tipped to be Norway's next prime minister, wants to continue Norway's existing immigration policies and will have to negotiate with the Progress Party for them to abandon several of their manifesto promises. ""There are some of their proposals that we disagree on. We don't think all asylum seekers should be kept in closed camps [as proposed by the Progress Party]. We have red lines, of course,"" Mrs Solberg said. Changing democracy During his trial last year, Breivik said he carried out his attacks to overthrow Norway's democratic system. As Vegard Groeslie Wennesland packed up his Labour Party election stand on the last day of campaigning, he felt confident Breivik had failed. ""If he changed anything, he made people more active in the democratic organisations that we have - the political parties and other interest groups. The youth movements of the political parties have experienced increases in membership, lots more are actively participating in the elections. ""I hope that this election will show one major change from the previous election, and that is that we have a much higher voter turnout than we've had before,"" said Mr Wennesland. If polls are correct, there will be on other change too. Jens Stoltenberg's Labour-led coalition will have to step aside for a new centre-right government.","Two years after the extreme-right terror attacks on Norway's Labour government and youth movement, voters look set to elect a centre-right government on Monday."
"MDC leader Nelson Chamisa says he has evidence to show that he was cheated out of the 30 July presidential vote. His party says the poll was marred by ""mammoth theft and fraud"", but the electoral commission insists that there was ""no skulduggery"". Mr Mnangagwa won 50.8% of the vote compared with Mr Chamisa's 44.3%. ""The inauguration is no longer going ahead as planned,"" Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said, after the opposition filed the challenge on Friday. Zimbabwe's constitution allows a presidential candidate to legally challenge electoral results within seven days of a winner being declared. The Constitutional Court now has 14 days to rule on the legal challenge by the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The party must prove that any irregularities were grave enough to change the outcome of the vote. If it does this successfully, the court could order a recount or nullify the result altogether. Mr Chamisa wants the court to declare him the winner or call a fresh election, his lawyer told Reuters news agency. ""We have a good case and cause!"" he tweeted shortly after filing the challenge. At least six people were killed two days after the vote in clashes between security forces and MDC Alliance supporters who alleged that Mr Chamisa had been robbed of victory. There was great optimism that the elections would bring real change after the end of Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule in November. But the MDC say the security forces have launched a brutal crackdown on the opposition following the disputed poll. Mr Mnangagwa has appealed for peace and promised an independent investigation into the post-election violence. By narrowly winning more than 50% of the vote Mr Mnangagwa, a member of the ruling Zanu-PF party, avoided a run-off election against Mr Chamisa. The challenge to the election result comes one day after MDC Alliance politician Tendai Biti appeared in court on charges of inciting violence. Zambia's government rejected Mr Biti's request for asylum, and on Thursday he was released on $5,000 (£4,300) bail and ordered to surrender his passport. Prosecutors accuse him of fuelling illegal protests by rejecting Mr Mnangagwa's victory in the fiercely contested elections. Mr Biti is the first senior opposition politician to be detained since Mr Mnangagwa took over from Mr Mugabe.",Sunday's inauguration of Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been halted after a legal challenge by the opposition against the election result.
"Mr Spicer stepped down because he was unhappy with President Donald Trump's appointment of a new communications director, according to reports. Combative Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci has been picked for the role that Mr Spicer partially filled. Mr Spicer's press briefings were a cable news hit, but in recent weeks he withdrew from the camera's glare. He told US media that the White House ""could benefit from a clean slate"". Later, appearing on Fox News, Mr Spicer said that with Mr Scaramucci's appointment there was a risk of ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" in the White House media operation, which was why he was stepping down. The 45 year old said he had told Mr Trump he ""would stay on for a few weeks to achieve a smooth transition"", and was looking forward to spending more time with his family. He defended the president's agenda and hit out at what he termed ""media bias"", saying: ""I was increasingly disappointed about the way the media here do their job, or don't do their job."" The shake-up at the White House comes amid several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US presidential election and whether Mr Trump's campaign team colluded with Moscow. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had ""vehemently"" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a ""major mistake"". Spicer's low points Announcing that he would step down next month, Mr Spicer tweeted that it had been ""an honor & a privilege to serve"" the president. The BBC's White House reporter Tara McKelvey says journalists besieged the 18-acre complex so they could film Mr Spicer leaving. What does Scaramucci say? In an assured debut, he attended Friday afternoon's news conference to announce that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, formerly Mr Spicer's deputy, would step into his shoes. ""I love the president and it's an honour to be here,"" Mr Scaramucci said, adding: ""He is genuinely a wonderful human being."" He also said: ""The president has really good karma."" Mr Scaramucci, who has no previous experience in communications roles, paid tribute to Mr Spicer as ""a true American patriot"" and ""incredibly gracious"". ""I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,"" he said. Mr Scaramucci also apologised and said he had been ""unexperienced"" as he explained his previous criticism of the president. In an August 2015 interview with Fox Business, he dismissed Mr Trump as a ""hack"" and ""an inherited money dude"" with ""a big mouth"". Mr Scaramucci is currently senior vice-president of the Export-Import Bank, a US government agency which guarantees loans for foreign buyers of American exports. A former member of the Trump transition team, he mistakenly suggested to the BBC in January that Elton John would play at the new president's inauguration. The singer promptly denied it. Bigger tremors to come? Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Life on a White House staff is intense and exhausting. This administration is under particular pressure, given the ongoing Russia investigation, recent legislative setbacks and a president who can be, shall we say, occasionally off-message. Now cracks in the structure are beginning to show. Sean Spicer's departure, reportedly because he doesn't want to work for newly named communication director Anthony Scaramucci, represents the most significant shakeup within the administration's senior team to date. It could also be a sign of bigger tremors to come. Mr Spicer was closely allied with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was his boss last year in the Republican National Committee. The Trump team has been rife with personal feuds, as various factions vie for a mercurial president's ear. Leaks abound. The prestige and power of advisers and aides wax and wane. Media reports abound of a White House under siege. And just a reminder - the Trump presidency is only six months old. Ms Huckabee Sanders read a statement from President Trump, saying: ""I am grateful for Sean's work on behalf of my administration and the American people. ""I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities. Just look as his great television ratings."" On day one in January, Mr Spicer set the tone of his relationship with the press by bursting into the briefing room to berate journalists for their reporting of crowd numbers at President Trump's inauguration. His proclivity for gaffes and garbling of his words, as well as making debatable assertions, soon made Mr Spicer a household name. But he could also be charming and was liked by many among the press corps. Mr Spicer was lampooned on topical comedy show Saturday Night Live, where Melissa McCarthy played him as a loud-mouthed bully who brandished his lectern at reporters. Mr Trump noted approvingly in April that Mr Spicer ""gets great ratings"". A month later, the president said: ""He's doing a good job but he gets beat up."" Mr Spicer was roundly mocked after he reportedly hid by a hedgerow on the White House grounds to avoid reporters on the night Mr Trump fired the FBI director in May. His last on-camera briefing was on 20 June, and there have been few since then. Members of the media have accused the Trump administration of attempting to kill off the daily news conferences to avoid scrutiny. Six months of Trump","White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has quit, reportedly in protest at an organisational shake-up."
"The body of Scott Johnson, 27, was found at the bottom of beach cliffs in 1988. Police ruled it a suicide. However, later inquiries concluded he had been killed in a hate crime. This also drew attention to other cases of homophobic killings around Sydney's beaches in the 1980s. Scott Price, 49, was arrested at his Sydney home on Tuesday. He was refused bail and will face a court on Wednesday. The New South Wales police chief said it was a ""career highlight"" to call Scott Johnson's brother, Steve, who lives in the US, to inform him of the arrest. The police force has previously apologised to the family for not investigating the case properly in the 1980s and failing to protect the gay community. ""While we have a long way to go in the legal process, it must be acknowledged that if it wasn't for the determination of the Johnson family... we wouldn't be where we are today,"" Commissioner Mick Fuller said. 'He needed me to do this' Scott, a gifted University of Cambridge maths student, had moved from the US to Sydney to be with his partner in 1986. He had been close to completing his PhD when he was found dead at the bottom of the North Head cliffs in Manly. His brother Steve campaigned for decades for the case to be re-investigated. He told the BBC in 2018 it was ""inconceivable"" that his brother had jumped off a cliff. ""This is a very emotional day,"" he said in a video message on Tuesday. ""He was my best friend and he really needed me to do this."" Family petitions sparked coroner investigations in 2012 and 2015 which both recommended police reopen the case. However no action was taken until a third inquiry in 2017 where the coroner found Scott had died as a result of a gay hate crime. Police offered a A$1m (£570,000; $645,000) cash reward in 2018 for information about the case. Two months ago the family doubled the reward to A$2m. It's now estimated up to 80 gay men were murdered by homophobic gangs in and around Sydney in the late 1980s - with many pushed off cliffs. Mr Johnson said he hoped the arrest ""opens the door"" for others to receive justice. ""I hope the family and friends of the other dozens of gay men who lost their lives find solace in what's happened today,"" he said.",Australian police have charged a man with the decades-old murder of a gay US student in Sydney.
"Ruben Espinosa, who worked for the investigative magazine Proceso, had recently moved to the city from the eastern state of Veracruz where he said he had been threatened and harassed. Veracruz is considered one of the most dangerous Mexican states for journalists to work in. They are often the targets of organised crime linked to drugs gangs. Proceso said the killings were discovered in the Narvarte neighbourhood of Mexico City a day after Mr Espinosa's family lost contact with him. The other four victims were all women. Three of them had lived in the apartment and the fourth was a domestic employee, the city prosecutor's office said. Officials said identifications and cause of death were still being verified. However, Proceso said Mr Espinosa had suffered two gunshot wounds. Many journalists under threat in Mexican states have taken refuge in the capital and the government has set up an agency to help protect them. Free speech advocacy group Article 19 said Mr Espinosa was the first journalist to be killed while in exile in Mexico City. It said his death marked a new level of violence against journalists in Mexico. Earlier this year, the National Commission on Human Rights said 97 journalists had been killed in Mexico in connection with their work since 2010.",A Mexican photojournalist has been found dead along with four other people in a flat in Mexico City.
"A lockdown imposed on 12 March in Italy, where the number of deaths may soon overtake China, will now extend beyond the original 25 March end date. France said its 15-day lockdown might also be extended, with European leaders reluctant to give any deadline for an end to crisis measures. There have been 207,000 cases worldwide with more than 8,600 deaths. The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an emergency €750bn ($820bn; £700bn) package to ease the impact of the pandemic, with boss Christine Lagarde tweeting ""there are no limits"" to its commitment to the euro. Europe's markets stabilised on opening, moving into positive territory, although Asian markets remained volatile with the Nikkei closing down 1%. The EU has introduced strict border controls. Travellers from outside are being turned away from airports and borders after the 27-country bloc imposed a 30-day ban to halt the spread of coronavirus. But EU leaders also agreed that internal borders that have been erected in recent days should come down. Separately, the EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had tested positive for coronavirus. He said on Twitter: ""I am doing well and in good spirits."" It is unclear how the pandemic will affect Brexit talks. The latest round was delayed on Wednesday but the UK government said it would look at different ways to continue discussions. What of the Italian and French lockdowns? Italy shut down most businesses and banned public gatherings nationwide on 12 March. But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday: ""The measures we have taken... must be extended beyond their original deadline."" He said the measures had meant ""we have avoided the collapse of the system"". But he told Corriere della Sera that ""we will not be able to return immediately to life as it was before"" even when the measures ended. On Wednesday, Italy reported that 475 more people had died in just one day. Any similar figure on Thursday would see it pass China's official death toll of 3,130, according to an ongoing list supplied by Johns Hopkins. A report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita into the deaths in Italy of 2,003 people confirmed to be positive for coronavirus found that three regions, all in the north, were by far the worst hit. Lombardy accounted for 71%, Emilia-Romagna 17% and Veneto 3.9%. None of 13 other regions had more than 2% of the total, and 10 of them had less than 1%. Some studies point to the large number of elderly in the affected regions, and that a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with them. Different demographics in other nations may help to keep the death toll lower. France began its lockdown on Tuesday morning, requiring citizens to carry official paperwork stating why they were not at home. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told Europe 1 radio on Thursday: ""The 15-day period may be extended. If necessary, the government will renew it."" He said that 4,095 fines had been handed out to transgressors and 70,000 control checks made since Wednesday morning. The fine is €135 ($150; £123). ""Some people think they're some kind of modern-day hero when they break the rules - but they're imbeciles, and a danger to themselves,"" Mr Castaner said. What else is happening in Europe? Spain announced on Thursday its coronavirus deaths had risen by 169 to 767 in the past 24 hours, an increase of 28%. Its number of infected people rose by 3,431, reaching 17,147. Spain is the world's fourth-worst affected country and is under nationwide lockdown. German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the nation on television on Wednesday, which she has previously only done for her annual New Year message. ""The situation is serious. Take it seriously. Not since German reunification, no, not since World War Two has our country faced a challenge that depends so much on our collective solidarity,"" she said. Germany has not imposed stringent measures, although it has closed schools and many businesses and public spaces. People can still go out and socialise but German media said her speech appeared to be a final warning to avoid mandatory lockdowns. Mrs Merkel did not announce new measures but said that could change at any time. On Thursday Germany reported that its number of coronavirus cases had increased to 10,999. The number of deaths there remains low but has risen to 20, the Robert Koch Institute said. The UK has also not imposed stringent lockdown measures as yet but has announced schools will close. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he could not give any date for when they might reopen. London is the worst-affected area in the UK and has now begun to slim down transport services. But the prime minister's spokesman said the government had no plans to bring in blanket travel restrictions for London or shut down the city's transport system. ""There is zero prospect of any restriction being placed on travelling in or out of London,"" he told reporters. He added that the police would maintain law and order, and there were no plans to use the military for this. Wednesday saw Russia report its first coronavirus-related death, a 79-year-old woman who died from pneumonia in Moscow. The country, which has reported only 147 cases, has temporarily barred entry to foreigners. It insists it has been transparent with its figures after some analysts questioned the low number.

"It is investing more than £40m over the next five years and will replace all of Jersey's copper cables with fibre. The company also plans to roll out fibre optic broadband to Guernsey as part of their Gigabit Isles programme. It hopes the investment will allow them to offer home customers broadband speeds of 1gb and higher within five years. Graeme Millar, Jersey Telecom chief executive officer, said they have already replaced their core data network with fibre. He told BBC Jersey: ""The core network, we have a super high way of fibre around the island, although it is maybe 20% of our network it carries 80% of our traffic and we've already converted that to fibre. ""What we are now looking at is the last mile to people's houses, that is what we need to deal with next."" The Jersey government-owned company has already spent nearly £30m over the past eight years upgrading links to France and the UK as well as making their core network fibre. This means they are already able to offer businesses in the island 10gb connections. They think they will need to spend an extra £40m over five years to deliver 1gb connections to all home customers, but some will be able to get that speed this year.

"The 19th Century statue, in Sydney's central Hyde Park, has come under scrutiny following recent discussion over Confederate monuments in the US. Critics say the inscription overlooks indigenous Australians, while others defend it as being part of history. Sydney's city council says it will seek advice on the issue. Lord Mayor Clover Moore said she had referred the debate to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advisory panel. When was the statue built? The monument was installed more than a century after Capt Cook arrived in Australia in 1770, later claiming the region for the British crown. Funded by the New South Wales government and members of the public, the statue was completed by English sculptor Thomas Woolner and unveiled in front of a huge crowd in 1879. It bears inscriptions marking Capt Cook's birth and death, but it is the south-facing engraving - ""Discovered this territory 1770"" - which has caused controversy. What is the criticism? The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's indigenous affairs editor, Stan Grant, wrote an article on Friday arguing that ""surely we need no longer maintain the fiction that he [Capt Cook] 'discovered' this country"". Grant said that the inscription should be changed. He argued that some other indigenous people favoured removing the statue. Referring to a comment by PM Malcolm Turnbull about honouring indigenous Australians, Grant wrote: ""If he is serious then what could be more apt than to correct a monument that tells us, still, that in 1770 we did not exist?"" His argument has provoked much national discussion, and has received support, particularly on social media. Grant wrote the column following violent clashes in Virginia earlier this month and debate about America's racial legacy. How is it being defended? In a column for The Australian, historian Keith Windschuttle wrote that the inscription was ""perfectly accurate"" if the word ""territory"" was defined as the east coast of Australia. ""Cook was in fact the first person in history to traverse the whole of this coastline and view its 2,000 miles (3,200km) of shores and hinterland,"" he wrote, describing the debate as ""wanton provocation"". Others have suggested keeping the monument but finding better ways to publicly acknowledge indigenous Australians. ""What is wrong with telling both stories, rather than rewriting history and obliterating a plaque to James Cook?"" one commentator, Tim Webster, told Channel Seven. What does Sydney's council say? Ms Moore said the issue would be discussed by its indigenous advisory board before the council took any position. ""There have been too many people in mainstream Australia ready to make judgement on these issues without consulting indigenous communities, and whether well-meaning or not, it's often done more harm than good,"" she said in a statement to the BBC. She said the council had undertaken several initiatives to recognise indigenous culture. Is this an isolated debate? No, discussion about how to better recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians has stepped up in recent months. In May, a landmark summit of indigenous leaders called for a formal representative body in parliament and a pathway to a treaty. The national Australia Day celebration, an anniversary of the arrival of Britain's First Fleet, has also sparked controversy. Two Melbourne councils in the last week have voted - one unanimously - to shift their celebrations over indigenous cultural sensitivities.","A debate has ignited in Australia over a statue of British explorer Captain James Cook, which has a plaque saying he ""discovered this territory""."
"One of T-14 Armata tanks suddenly stopped on Red Square, and the driver raised a red flag - apparently to signal that he had problems. A tow vehicle was brought in, but the tank later managed to drive on. The parade announcer said the stoppage had been planned to show how to ""evacuate weaponry"". This prompted laughter from the crowds who gathered to watch the rehearsal in the Russian capital, Reuters reports. Alexei Zharich, deputy head of the Uralvagonzavod tank producing factory, later wrote on Twitter (in Russian) that the tank ""was in full working order and left on its own"". He also posted a video showing the vehicle leaving Red Square. Russia's military was responsible for the rehearsal, Mr Zharich added, and any questions should be addressed to it. The T-14 Armata has been the most talked-about innovation in Russia's new armoury ahead of the 9 May World War Two Victory parade. It has a remotely controlled cannon and offers additional protection to its crew, Russian military experts say. And Russia's RT news says the Armata could ""evolve into a fully robotic battle vehicle"". The experts also claim the tank is superior to the T-90 - the current mainstay of the Russian army - and also to all Western analogues. Russia plans to bring in about 2,300 Armatas, starting in 2020.","Russia's new high-tech battle tank has ground to a halt during a rehearsal for 9 May Victory parade in Moscow, prompting speculation of a breakdown."
"Some commentators say the country was forced into the move as co-operation with Europe could lead to ""big losses in Russian markets"". Analysts in Russia are more blunt in their assessment, seeing Ukraine's U-turn as a result of direct pressure from Moscow. 'Tired of waiting for mercy' The pro-government Ukrainian tabloid Segodnya says the authorities had no choice but to pull out of the EU deal. The paper says Ukraine was ""tired of waiting for mercy from both the EU and Russia"", and portrays the U-turn as ""launching an offensive"". ""The EU is apparently unprepared to help us financially to the extent we need to escape a financial crisis. Meanwhile, Russia is threatening us with trade wars,"" it says. ""As a result, we have suspended preparations for the signing of an association agreement with the EU."" An apologetic Ukrainian political analyst, Vadym Karasyov, tells the Ukrainian version of Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda that ""we have suspended the talks, not European integration"". He argues that ""an association with the EU currently entails big losses on Russian markets"" and adds that Kiev should now try and ""allay Russian fears that a free trade zone between Ukraine and the EU carries economic risks for the Kremlin"". The Ukrainian version of another Russian daily, Kommersant, goes even further by suggesting that, in return for suspending plans for the landmark agreement with the EU, ""the [Ukrainian] government expects to receive financial assistance from Russia and resume trade with the CIS [an association of ex-Soviet states]"". The editor in chief of Den seems to be one of the few to sound alarm bells. ""The Ukrainian pause is a very dangerous phenomenon. We are not isolated in this world. Sabre-toothed tigers are roaming nearby, keen to take advantage of our failure,"" says Larysa Ivshyna. She adds that ""Ukraine's fate"" was decided at a secret meeting between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian news and analysis website Ukrayinska Pravda also laments the fact that Kiev, which was ""one step away from its goal"", suddenly backed down. Meanwhile, the Glavred website predicts that the move could trigger a political crisis in Ukraine. ""The government's decision gave a boost to protest moods and led to spontaneous pro-Europe protests in central Kiev,"" it reports. 'Stealing the bride at the altar' The Russian press links Ukraine's decision with arm-twisting from Moscow. Writing in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Tatiana Ivzhenko recalls that the text of the agreement between Kiev and Brussels ""was prepared over many years and was fully approved by the Ukrainian side"". She says the Ukrainian U-turn came after ""three secret meetings"" between Mr Yanukovych and Mr Putin. ""Europe was shocked by the instantaneous change of Kiev's foreign policy vector and linked it to pressure from Moscow,"" she writes. ""It was an impressive move - like stealing a bride at the altar, says a Russian federal official source jokingly,"" writes business daily Vedomosti. The paper also quotes political pundit Alexei Portansky, who says ""this is a win for Putin, but only a temporary one"". ""Ukraine won't join the customs union or abandon European integration. Kiev has been forced to back down for the time being, under pressure from the Kremlin, fearing that Moscow would use the harshest measures,"" says Portansky. Speaking to Kommersant, political analyst Alexei Vlasov says Kiev's decision was influenced by worries about ""the personal political future"" of Ukraine's president. ""Yanukovych wants to be re-elected in 2015, and Euro integration is a second-order issue for him,"" Vlasov says.

"The device was found near the BMX track and water pumping station in Mooragh Promenade, in Ramsey on Wednesday. It was detonated ""without incident"" by Explosives and Ordnance Disposal specialists. Insp Derek Flint said the cordon had been lifted. Two nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution.",A controlled explosion has been carried out on an unexploded WW2 bomb that was unearthed at a new sewerage works on the Isle of Man.
"UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Haitian President Michel Martelly to inform him of the decision. The UN says it is immune from such claims under the UN's Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN. Evidence suggests cholera was introduced to Haiti through a UN base's leaking sewage pipes. The UN has never acknowledged responsibility for the outbreak - which has infected more than 600,000 people - saying it is impossible to pinpoint the exact source of the disease, despite the mounting evidence the epidemic was caused by poor sanitation at a camp housing infected Nepalese peacekeepers. In a terse statement, Mr Ban's spokesman said damages claims for millions of dollars filed by lawyers for cholera victims was ""not receivable"" under the 1947 convention that grants the UN immunity for its actions. But a lawyer for the cholera victims told the BBC's Barbara Plett at the UN that UN immunity could not mean impunity, and said the case would now be pursued in a national court. The lawyer, Brian Concannon, said the victims' legal team would challenge the UN's right to immunity from Haitian courts, on the grounds that it had not established an alternative mechanism for dealing with accountability issues, as stipulated in its agreement with the government. He also said lifting immunity would not challenge UN policy, which is protected by the convention, but its practice, such as how to test troops for disease and properly dispose of sewage. In December the UN launched a $2bn (£1.3bn) appeal to fight the cholera epidemic, which is currently the worst outbreak in the world, and Mr Ban reiterated to Mr Martelly the UN's commitment to the elimination of cholera in Haiti. Cholera is a disease of poverty, analysts say. It is spread through infected faeces and, once it enters the water supply, it is difficult to stop - especially in a country like Haiti which has almost no effective sewage disposal systems.","The United Nations has formally rejected compensation claims by victims of a cholera outbreak in Haiti that has killed almost 8,000 people."
"Brian McMahon, 50, from St Saviour, Jersey is accused of killing Melvin Murphy in St Helier on Sunday. Mr Murphy was attacked between between 22:30 and 23:30 BST and died later in hospital. Police said two men were seen arguing in the doorway of the Robin Hood pub beforehand and are appealing for witnesses to come forward.",A man has been charged with manslaughter after a 65-year-old man died following an assault.
"""The trigger man will be blamed, while those who actually ordered the killing will go free,"" Ilya Yashin, co-founder of Mr Nemtsov's party, said on Sunday. His comments came after two men of Chechen origin were charged with his murder and three others arrested. Mr Yashin rejected suggestions radical Islamists were behind the murder. ""The investigators' nonsensical theory about Islamist motives in the killing suits the Kremlin and takes [President] Putin out of the firing line,"" Mr Yashin said on Twitter (in Russian). Those behind the killing were in Russia and even in government, he said separately in a BBC interview. On Sunday, a court in Moscow charged Zaur Dadayev and Anzor Gubashev with shooting Mr Nemtsov on a bridge near the Kremlin on 27 January. Mr Dadayev had admitted his involvement, the court said. Three other suspects were remanded in custody. A sixth man was reported to have killed himself in a standoff with police in the Chechen capital Grozny. Threats Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, described Mr Dadayev as a devout Muslim who was shocked by cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published in French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. ""All who know Zaur [Dadayev] confirm that he is a deep believer and also that he, like all Muslims, was shocked by the activities of Charlie and comments in support of printing the cartoons."" Along with other Russian politicians and activists, Mr Nemtsov had condemned the killing of 12 journalists at the French satirical magazine by Islamist extremists. But he also criticised threats made by the Chechen leader towards those who did not condemn cartoons published by the magazine. Mr Kadyrov had declared former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky his ""personal enemy"" for urging other papers to republish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. He had also said Ekho Mosvky editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov ""would be called to account"" after his station's website ran a poll on whether media should publish similar cartoons. This prompted Mr Nemtsov to accuse Mr Kadyrov of violating Russia's criminal code by infringing journalists' activities. ""Everybody is already sick and tired of Ramzan's threats, but he is certain that [President] Putin will not let anyone touch him, so he is growing increasingly brazen every day,"" Mr Nemtsov wrote on his Facebook page in January. Mr Kadyrov received a medal of honour from President Putin on Monday. The award was for ""his outstanding achievements, social activities and many years of honest work,"" a presidential decree said. 'Public proof' Mr Yashin told the BBC that Mr Nemtsov had not been a prominent critic of radical Islam and had concentrated his attacks on President Putin and his government. He said he did not believe Mr Nemtsov's killers were from outside Russia, calling his murder ""an act of terror to scare society"". If the Russian authorities had any proof that the two men charged were the killers, that proof should be made public, he said. ""I believe that the organisers of the murder are in Russia and I believe that they are in the Russian government,"" he added. The location of the murder, right next to the Kremlin, made him think that the killers could not have acted without support from the authorities, he said. He said people criticised by Mr Nemtsov in recent years should be under investigation. Mr Nemtsov's daughter, Zhanna, also said she was convinced her father's critical views of the Kremlin were the reason behind his death. Appearing on a talkshow on German television on Sunday evening, she said the Kremlin would have had a motive to kill him. ""My father wanted to convince the West that those at the top of Russian television were lying to the public,"" she said, adding that if those now arrested effectively worked for the Chechen interior ministry, ""the political responsibility did indeed lie with the government in Moscow"". 'Contract killing' The three men remanded in custody are Mr Gubashev's younger brother, Shagid, and two men named as Ramzan Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. Reports say all three have denied any involvement in the murder. The Russian Investigations Committee is treating the case as a ""contract killing"", Interfax news agency reported. President Putin has condemned Mr Nemtsov's murder and called for an end to ""shameful"" political killings in Russia. Mr Nemtsov was killed days before a march he had been organising against the conflict in Ukraine. He had also been drafting a report expected to expose covert Russian military involvement in the conflict.","A close ally of murdered Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov says he is ""totally sceptical"" that the two men charged organised his killing."
"""I think he should quit,"" said Labor Party leader Bill Shorten. ""He's delivered instability."" The election result remained too close to call as counting of votes resumed Tuesday morning. The PM said he had ""every confidence"" his conservative coalition would be able to form a majority government. Australia faces the prospect of a ""hung parliament"" after neither of the two main parties reached the 76-seat quota required to form a government. According to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), the vote tallies show that in the contest for the 150 lower house seats, the ruling conservative coalition has won 67 seats and the centre-left Labor Party has won 71 seats. A total of six seats has gone to independents and minor parties, and six seats remain in doubt, the AEC says. But experts cast doubt on these figures, with the Australian Broacasting Corp.'s respected analyst Antony Green saying the AEC's website shows seats as decided when they are actually too close to call. Mr Green's count has the coalition on 68 seats, Labor on 67, others on five and 10 undecided. Election sizzles: Democracy with a side of sausage Cartoon: Planet of Forbidden Prime Ministers Are Australians ready to gamble on yet another PM? The massive scale of Australia's election Who's who in Australia's 2016 federal elections? During the government's re-election campaign, Mr Turnbull campaigned on a ""jobs and growth"" slogan and, in the final week, added two words: ""stable government"". According to the Labor Party leader, the prime minister failed to deliver the stability he had promised. ""Mr Turnbull tried to capitalise on the Brexit vote and say because of what happened in England that you had to vote for him in Australia,"" Mr Shorten said. ""He's Brexited himself. This guy's like the David Cameron of the southern hemisphere."" Australia has had five prime ministers in the past six years. Despite the poor showing during the coalition's re-election campaign, Mr Turnbull is looking to avoid adding to that tally. The prime minister on Sunday called for the Liberal Party to remain calm. ""I can promise all Australians that we will dedicate our efforts to ensuring that the state of new Parliament is resolved without division or rancour,"" he said. Senator Cory Bernardi, from the right-wing of the ruling Liberal Party, said that Mr Turnbull and campaign strategists ""need to be held to account"". ""I think in the end he should be asking himself if he has done the Liberal Party a service or a disservice,"" he said. ""The broader picture and the question we've got to ask ourselves is how did we get to a circumstance where we had a significant majority in the House of Representatives and now the best option is perhaps to form minority government."" Analysts predict that Mr Turnbull's coalition will form an administration working closely with crossbenchers to pass legislation. Labor Party stalwart Anthony Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Australia's major political parties needed to engage more with voters. ""I think there's a sense of alienation from mainstream politics that allows for populist parties… to be able to present simplistic answers to what can be very complex problems,"" he said.",Australia's opposition leader has urged Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to resign after a cliff-hanger election failed to deliver a clear winner.

"Audit officials said that 491m yuan (£49m: $77.8m) was lost due to ""irregular practises in the construction and management"". That money had been set aside to compensate residents who had their homes demolished by the scheme. The 1,318km (820 miles) railway began operations in June 2011. China's National Audit Office (NAO) said it had discovered evidence of fraud and irregular accounting and procurement related to the project in a second round of accounting. Another audit conducted in 2010 found that 187m yuan ($28.5m; £17.5m) had been stolen by individuals and construction companies. It is unclear whether this figure is part of the current audit. In a report based on audit done between June to September 2011, NAO said that purchases amounting to 849m yuan were not made through the standard bidding process. The cancellation of some building contracts also meant that 413m yuan was not used. According to the report, construction firms that built the railway also owed 8.2bn yuan to suppliers and workers' salaries. China's high-speed railway network, said to be the largest in the world, has been plagued with corruption and safety scandals. Its railway minister, Liu Zhijun, was sacked over corruption allegations last year. The network has also been dogged by a series of accidents, including a deadly crash in Wenzhou city last year that killed 40 people, and the most recent collapse of railway track in Hubei province.","Millions of dollars have been embezzled from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail link project, China's state news agency Xinhua reports."
"By Dominic Packer & Jay Van BavelProfessors of psychology ""Snowflake"", used dismissively to suggest younger generations might melt if confronted with the harsh realities of life, was readily applied to the stereotypical urban Remainer. Meanwhile, the caricature of Brexiteers as older men, cheeks ruddy with outrage, led to the insult ""gammon"" - an unflattering comparison with the pinkish cured pork associated with dining in British pubs. Creating such cartoon versions of political opponents is hardly limited to the UK. A recent study of Americans suggested Republicans vastly overestimate the proportion of Democrats who are atheist or agnostic at 36% - four times the reality. In turn, Democrats estimated 44% of Republicans made more than $250,000 (£192,000) a year. Only 2% do. The role of social media We develop these stereotypes partly from personal experience. But just as often, they are formed by what we hear from friends, family and colleagues. Stereotypes are further reinforced by social media, where we can gain likes and followers by calling out opponents. Research suggests polarisation can increase voter turnout, which may encourage political leaders to further sharpen divisions. The media, propagandists, and foreign agents can profit from fanning these flames. It all creates the impression of two deeply disconnected groups in societies around the globe - the left and the right. How we overestimate our differences Yet, while polarisation in many nations appears to be at historically high levels, research by the More In Common initiative - an international body studying polarisation - suggests people vastly overestimate political differences. Prof Anne Wilson, a psychologist at Canada's Wilfrid Laurier University, says: ""Misjudgements of the other side aren't arbitrary: people are more likely to overestimate the proportion of opponents who hold the more extreme or unflattering views linked to their party. But we also see blindness to common ground."" As an example, she says the portrayal of US gun control as a ""two-sides"" issue obscures shared beliefs. This includes strong support among both Democrats and Republicans for background checks and a higher minimum age for gun owners Common values about child rearing, health care, or civic responsibilities are also found. Crossing divides A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world. Finding empathy for others People can be reluctant to mix with those they assume to be different from themselves. But without these interactions, we lose the capacity for reality checks and to see the humanity in others. Language can fuel polarisation. When people use moral and emotional words on Twitter - like ""evil"", ""lewd"", or ""sin"" - messages spread more virally within (but not between) their social networks. But some of our research, led by Mina Cikara, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, found that when people are shown images suggesting the social networks of different groups are quite overlapping, empathy for members of the opposing group increases. ""Seeing a picture indicating that these people share social ties was enough to shrink respondents' empathy gap,"" says Prof Cikara. The benefits of co-operating Democracy is built upon on our ability to vigorously disagree but ultimately find sufficient common ground to forge a consensus. If left and right co-operated, societies might be better placed to address challenges in areas like health care, the climate, education or terrorism. More like this Teaching people about how often political polarisation is overestimated might help, suggests research by Prof Cikara and Jeffrey Lees. Prof Cikara says: ""People are smart and responsive. When we let them know that they were wrong about how upset the other side might be in response to a policy, they also updated how much they said the opposing party is driven by malicious obstruction."" When members of different groups are reminded that they hold important identities in common - for example as part of a nation, or international community - relations improve and co-operation emerges. In studies, we have created new groups in the lab from a simple flip of a coin. We had people join a team that included members of their own racial group, as well as members of another race. Within minutes, participants showed lower levels of racial bias. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging - like the MRI scans doctors use to detect brain injury, but tracking changes in blood flow - we monitored activity in regions of the brain that indicate emotions or perceptions. The brain data, in particular, suggested that when people understood themselves as part of a common group, they began to see one another as individuals. When people feel stereotyped, they are less likely to listen and conflict escalates. By signalling that you see someone accurately, you can take the first step towards restoring a sense of common humanity. What you can do to change the way you see others A recent example of this came from former US Navy Seal James Hatch, who described his experience of enrolling as Yale's oldest first-year undergraduate, aged 52, last year. Aware of the ""snowflake"" student stereotype, he wrote: ""I have sure had my mind changed here at Yale. To me there is no dishonour in being wrong and learning. There is dishonour in wilful ignorance and there is dishonour in disrespect."" About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

"Mr Maduro said the two men were part of a group of ""mercenaries"" whose armed incursion into Venezuela by sea had been foiled on Sunday. Mr Maduro has often accused the US of trying to overthrow him. But US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the Venezuela situation ""has nothing to do with our government"". What does the Maduro government say happened? Venezuelan authorities said eight armed men were killed during Sunday's alleged coup attempt. In a live broadcast on Monday, Mr Maduro displayed what he said were the passports of the two arrested Americans - Airan Berry and Luke Denman - who work for a Florida-based security company. He told viewers: ""They were playing Rambo, they were playing hero."" The Venezuelan government said the group of ""terrorist mercenaries"" had left Colombia and landed in the town of Macuto, about 21 miles (34km) north of the capital Caracas, on Sunday, where they were arrested. Attorney General Tarek William Saab tweeted on Sunday, saying the group were ""seeking to cause a coup and an assassination attempt"". He shared photos of bullets and guns which were seized from them, according to the Venezuelan special forces. Who are the detained US citizens? Not much is yet known about Luke Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41. Venezuelan military high command said the pair were members of the US security forces. US media have suggested they are former members, but this has not been confirmed. When asked about them on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said: ""We'll find out. We just heard about it"", adding that they had no government connection. Jordan Goudreau, a former member of the US Army special forces, has, however, been quick to claim an association. He told Reuters news agency: ""They're working with me. Those are my guys."" Mr Goudreau, who leads a Florida-based private security firm called Silvercorp USA, said he was one of the plot's organisers. Why is a man from Florida involved? According to a recent investigation by the Associated Press news agency, Mr Goudreau has become involved with a group of retired Venezuelan military men who have allegedly been training deserters from Venezuela's security forces at secret camps in Colombia. They have reportedly plotted previous cross-border incursions which failed to get off the ground. The plan is said to have involved raiding military bases in the hope of igniting a popular rebellion that would end in the ousting of the president. In their report, released on Friday, AP said it had found no evidence of US government involvement in these plots. The news agency also said Mr Goudreau turned his focus to Venezuela in February 2019, after he worked on security at a benefit concert on the Colombian-Venezuelan border arranged by UK billionaire Richard Branson and supported by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó. What is happening now? Mr Goudreau has also released a video in which he referred to a ""daring amphibious raid"" that had gone ""deep into the heart of Caracas"", adding that various ""units had been activated"" across the country and were now fighting. There has been no evidence that any fighting is under way or that the group made it to Caracas. He has not mentioned killing President Maduro was an objective, as the government has claimed. What is the background to this? Mr Goudreau has also repeatedly made claims about past associations with Mr Guaidó, who is recognised by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader. On Monday, Mr Guaidó denied having anything to do with the ex-Green Beret. In a statement, he said he had ""no relationship nor responsibility for any actions"" taken by the US war veteran. He also accused President Maduro's administration of trying to distract people from recent outbreaks of violence - including a deadly prison riot on Friday and a gang battle in Caracas on Saturday night. Mr Guaidó has the backing of Washington, which has vowed to use tough sanctions to force President Maduro and the Socialist Party out of office.",Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro says two US citizens have been arrested following what he said was an attempt to overthrow him.
"By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent Sheikh Mohammed, 69, who is a billionaire racehorse owner and has often been seen conversing with the Queen at Ascot, has posted a furious poem on Instagram accusing an unidentified woman of ""treachery and betrayal"". The Jordanian-born and British-educated Princess Haya, 45, married Sheikh Mohammed - owner of Godolphin horse racing stables - in 2004, becoming his sixth and ""junior wife"". Sheikh Mohammed reportedly has 23 children by different wives. Princess Haya fled initially this year to Germany to seek asylum. She is now said to be living in a £85m ($107m) town house in Kensington Palace Gardens, in central London, and preparing for a legal battle in the High Court. So what prompted her to flee her luxurious life in Dubai and why is she said to be ""afraid for her life""? Sources close to her have said that Princess Haya had recently discovered disturbing facts behind the mysterious return to Dubai last year of Sheikha Latifa, one of the ruler's daughters. She fled the UAE by sea with the help of a Frenchman but was intercepted by armed men off the coast of India and returned to Dubai. Princess Haya then, along with the former Irish president Mary Robinson, defended Dubai's reputation over the incident. The Dubai authorities said the runaway Sheikha Latifa had been ""vulnerable to exploitation"" and was ""now safe in Dubai"". But human rights advocates said she was forcibly abducted against her will. Since then, it is alleged, Princess Haya has learnt new facts about the case and consequently came under increasing hostility and pressure from members of her husband's extended family until she no longer felt safe there. A source close to her said she fears she may now be abducted herself and ""rendered"" back to Dubai. The UAE embassy in London has declined to comment on what it says is a personal matter between two individuals. There is, however, a wider, international element to this story. Princess Haya, who was educated at Bryanston School in Dorset then University of Oxford, is thought likely to want to stay in the UK. If her estranged husband demands her return then this poses a diplomatic headache for Britain, which has close ties to the UAE. The case is also awkward for Jordan since Princess Haya is the half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah. Nearly a quarter of a million Jordanians work in the UAE, sending back remittances, and Jordan cannot afford a rift with Dubai. The BBC documentary Escape from Dubai: The Mystery of the Missing Princess will be re-broadcast on BBC Two at 23:15 BST on Thursday.","Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein, a wife of the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, is in hiding in London and said to be in fear for her life after fleeing her husband."
"By BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The main national TV channels unanimously echoed the Kremlin line, suggesting that the incident in Salisbury was being used merely as a pretext. More than 100 Russian diplomats from more than 20 countries were expelled in the wake of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. ""The reason they give is Skripal's poisoning, even though Moscow is still waiting for proof of Russia's involvement,"" NTV, one of Russia's main three TV channels, said. 'Utter claptrap' Over on state-controlled Channel One, top presenter Kirill Kleimenov was full of sarcasm. Commenting on PM Theresa May telling the parliament that Russia had ""a combination of the capability, the intent and the motive"" to poison the Skripals with a toxic agent, he said: ""They could have simply expelled the diplomats, but no: they invented this utter claptrap about some combination!"" The subsequent report reserved more sarcasm for the US, which ""hastened to show so-called solidarity on the largest scale"" with the ""biggest expulsion in its history"". Official state Rossiya 1 TV described the move as a ""co-ordinated demarche"" and mocked Ukraine in particular for its ""unbidden enthusiasm"" in expelling 13 Russians. Anti-Russian 'crusade' The diplomatic tensions were also a highlight on prime-time talk shows on state-controlled TV last night. Both guest and hosts reacted angrily to the expulsions, suggesting they were part of an anti-Russian campaign orchestrated by the US and UK. ""This looks not just like war, but of a crusade against Russia,"" Konstantin Blokhin, an expert from the Russian Academy of Sciences told a show on state TV's Channel One. Andrei Bezrukov, a lecturer at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, echoed the sentiment, alleging that the Skripal poisoning has nothing to do with the expulsions. ""What we see here reminds me of the Breughel painting, 'The blind leading the blind', the way they go one by one into the pit, into the water there. One country in the EU, Great Britain, is dragging down the others,"" he said on a show on another state TV channel, Rossiya 1. 'Full-fledged cold war' The rhetoric was less bellicose in business newspapers, which pondered the prospects of Russia-West relations in the wake of the latest escalation. Pundit Maxim Suchkov told RBC daily the the expulsions will ""spin the flywheel of the confrontation"" and result in a flood of tit-for-tat measures. Expert Fyodor Lukyanov's analysis was equally pessimistic. Russia's likely response ""will not put an end to the escalation"", he told Vedomosti, an influential business daily, adding: ""Relations between Russia and the West have entered a period of a full-fledged cold war.""

"They say the calls, made five times a day, have been disturbing residents of the Nyarugenge district, home to the capital's biggest mosques. But an official from a Muslim association criticised it, saying they could instead keep the volume down. Some 1,500 churches have been closed for not complying with building regulations and noise pollution. The majority of Rwandans are Christian. Muslims make up around 5% of the population. The government says the Muslim community has complied with the ban. Analysis: Rwanda's open secret Ally Yusuf Mugenzi: Editor of BBC Great Lakes service To understand the latest round of regulations imposed by Rwandan authorities on religious groups, we have to look back to the 1994 genocide, in which some 800,000 people were killed. A number of the Roman Catholic churches, where thousands of Tutsis had taken refuge, became killing grounds during the 100-day rampage. Rwandans lost faith in the powerful institution and gravitated towards Pentecostalism and Islam. Today's noise pollution concerns have silenced the loudspeakers on Kigali's mosques. But it would be wrong to say that Muslims are being targeted. They can still go to mosques and pray five times a day. The same cannot be said for the Pentecostals. About 1,500 Pentecostal churches across the country have been closed over the past month, leaving worshippers with nowhere to pray. This might have something to do with Rwanda's open secret: the country's religious denominations are expected to pledge loyalty to the government of long-time President Paul Kagame. Pentecostal leaders might not be toeing the line. But the authorities are right to focus on those churches' disregard for building regulations. Many of them hold noisy services, are badly constructed, situated in residential homes, and are a legitimate health and safety concern. ""I have found that they have begun to respect it and it has not stopped their followers from going to pray according to their praying time,"" Havuguziga Charles, a local official from Nyarugenge told the BBC's Great Lakes service. This comes as the government continues its clampdown on substandard churches across the East African country. Most of them were small Pentecostal churches, and one mosque was also closed. The government says the reason is that some preachers ""deceive their congregation with misleading sermons"", AFP reports. But some preachers have accused the government of trying to control their message to congregants in a country accused by human rights groups of stifling free speech.","Rwanda has banned mosques in the capital, Kigali, from using loudspeakers during the call to prayer."
"President Nicos Anastasiades said new measures, mostly affecting the Russian business community, would be approved at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Russians have billions of euros in Cypriot bank deposits. Investors were angered when it emerged they would lose up to 60% of their savings under the terms of the bailout. In order to secure the 10bn euros, agreed by the EU and IMF, Cyprus was forced to wind up one major bank and write-off of a large portion of secured debt and uninsured deposits in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus. Speaking at a Russian business conference in the coastal resort of Limassol, President Anastasiades said the new measures would ""mitigate to some extent the damage"" Russian investors had endured. Cyprus has been a member of the EU since 2004. It sealed an EU bailout last month to save it from bankruptcy. President Anastasiades said foreign investors who held deposits prior to 15 March, and who lost at least 3m euros would be eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship. Cyprus's existing ""citizenship by investment"" programme will also be revised to reduce the amount of investment required to be eligible from 10m euros to 3m. The president said he would also drop requirements for citizenship applicants to keep 15m euros in Cypriot banks for five years, saying they would be allowed immediate access to their money. ""These decisions will be deployed in a fast-track manner,"" President Anastasiades said. The Cypriot economy is worth about 18bn euros, which accounts for less than 0.2% of the eurozone total.",Cyprus is to relax its citizenship rules for foreign investors who lost at least 3m euros (£2.5m) under an EU bailout deal.
"In a letter to the president, Ms Rice said her confirmation process would be ""disruptive and costly"", NBC News said. Ms Rice has been at the centre of Republican criticism over the Obama administration response to a deadly attack on a US consulate in Libya. Mrs Clinton has said she will not serve a second term at the state department. In a letter to President Barack Obama, Ms Rice said that she was ""highly honoured"" to be considered for the post of secretary of state and was ""fully confident that I could serve our country ably and effectively in that role"". 'Unfair and misleading' But Ms Rice, 48, said the prospect of congressional opposition to her possible confirmation was behind her decision to withdraw from consideration. ""I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly - to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities,"" Ms Rice wrote to the president. ""That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country,"" she added, saying ""The position of Secretary of State should never be politicised."" Mr Obama said in a statement: ""I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice in recent weeks."" He added that her decision to withdraw from consideration reflected strength of character and an ability to rise above politics. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who has spoken out repeatedly about Ms Rice's response to the attack, said he respected her decision. ""President Obama has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next secretary of state,"" Mr Graham added. Correspondents say Massachusetts Senator John Kerry is now a strong candidate, with former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel reported to be a potential nominee for defence secretary. Mr Kerry issued a statement strongly defending Ms Rice, saying: ""I've defended her publicly and wouldn't hesitate to do so again because I know her character and I know her commitment. ""She's an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant. Today's announcement doesn't change any of that."" Ms Rice's troubles began days after the 11 September assault on the US consulate, Ms Rice said in a series of TV interviews that it seemed to have developed out of protests over an anti-Islamic film. But later intelligence reports suggested the attack was carried out by al-Qaeda affiliates. Her comments triggered a major political row over who knew what and when. The attack left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.","UN Ambassador Susan Rice has withdrawn her name for consideration to succeed Hillary Clinton as US secretary of state, the White House says."
"By Robin Levinson-KingBBC News, Toronto Betty White and Beatrice Arthur made it look like fun on the popular sitcom the Golden Girls, but what's it really like to share a house with others in your senior years? ""I've been amazed at how good it is,"" Louise Bardswich tells the BBC. Bardswich has been sharing a 4,000-sq-foot home with three other women in Port Perry, Ontario, since 2015. The four of them - Bardswich, 67, Martha Casson, 70, Beverly Brown, 68, and Sandy McCully, 74 - have become evangelists for this kind of housing, and have been dubbed the ""Golden Girls"" by Canadian media. While it's not unusual for relatives or close friends to move in with each other as they age, they believe their situation - the four women were all relative strangers - is the start of a new trend. The idea first struck Bardswich when she had to move her own mother into a retirement home. She had worked with Casson, and the two would talk about the struggles they were both facing caring for their aging parents, and planning for their own retirement. ""It was kind of a window into our futures,"" Bardswich says. Bardswich did the maths for herself, and quickly realised that with inflation, renting in a retirement home would totally deplete her savings. She was also worried about the toll taking care of her would take on her children. ""My kids are lovely, but I knew what it felt like to have to do that for my mom, and I didn't want them to have to go through that,"" she says. Interest in co-living for older people has risen as property rates in many areas around the world have skyrocketed along with the ageing population. By 2036, one in four Canadians is expected to be over the age of 65. According to a report by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, about 700,000 senior-led households currently struggle with housing affordability. It is especially challenging in more rural communities, where there is limited housing stock as it is, and people may have to move far away from their social network in order to find appropriate accommodation. In northern Ontario, a Facebook group for senior living looking to find housemates has attracted almost 1,500 members. Across the pond, a group of women moved into the UK's first co-op housing designed specifically for elderly women in 2016. The housing project had been in the works since 1998, but it encountered several planning hiccups along the way. ""I don't think British society was ready for it, a group of women who were going to take their own destiny in their own hands,"" Maria Brenton told the BBC's Sophie Long in 2016. The women of Port Perry encountered similar setbacks. When a builder applied for a permit to build a six-bedroom shared-ownership home in 2013, the township went as far as to try and pass a bylaw to outlaw this type of communal housing. Casson filed a human rights complaint, and two hours before council was set to vote, Ontario's human rights commissioner sent a scathing letter condemning the proposed bylaw, and reminding officials that that it is against the law to discriminate ""directly or indirectly against groups protected by the (Ontario Human Rights Commission). This includes the obligation to accommodate the needs of older people, people with disabilities and other needs relating to (OHRC) grounds."" The women finally got their home, at a different building site, in 2015. They're all very frank about the inevitability of ageing. They've designed the house so that they could ""age in place"", and not have to move because of physical limitations. This meant updating the home by installing an elevator, making the bathrooms accessible and leaving two bedrooms open for future live-in nurses. ""We talked about how we did not sign up to be each other's caregivers. When you need help, you're going to have to pay for the help, and if you can't be accommodated in the house with the help than that's the time you'll have to move,"" Bardswich says. The house is also designed to allow each woman as much independence as possible. Each person owns 25% of the property - if someone dies or moves out, their share would be put on the market. In addition, they each pay $1,500 a month towards living expenses, which includes a weekly house cleaner, landscaping, food and wine. They all have their own large bedroom, with a TV and seating area and a bathroom. They share a living room and dining room and large kitchen, complete with two dishwashers, which helps them avoid kitchen squabbles. ""We agreed we would live our own lives. We're all pretty busy and out all the time,"" Bardswich said. But that doesn't mean there isn't time for communal suppers, or wine on the porch. Each woman has brought a unique set of life experiences to the group, which they say makes the living situation even more fulfilling. Between the four of them there are 13 grandchildren, who all come by to visit. Two of the women are widowed, two are divorced. In the summer, they've let theatre students who are in town working in local productions stay in their spare rooms. Brown, who divorced in 1994, says she was initially hesitant about sharing a home after 25 years of living on her own. ""The surprising thing is what I enjoy the most is the company,"" she says. Since moving in, the four women giving regular talks to other older people thinking about sharing. They say their best advice is not to wait, but to plan for your future before others have to plan it for you. Bardswich likes to advise people to find housemates with similar values - ""a Republican and a Democrat shouldn't live together"". But Casson is quick to point out that between the four of them, two are actively religious and two are not. ""You can have some fairly fundamental differences, as long as you have some of the common values,"" she says.",Four Canadian pensioners say the secret to a happy retirement is good housemates - and two dishwashers.
"The MV Wakashio hit a coral reef, Pointe d'Esny, on 25 July while carrying 4,000 tonnes of fuel oil. It is now being towed away from the reef, a sanctuary for rare wildlife. Meanwhile, a team of experts from Japan is travelling to Mauritius to help with the clean-up. Most of the oil on board was pumped out before the ship broke apart at the weekend but nearly 1,000 tonnes leaked into the sea causing damage to the rich marine ecosystem. An environment ministry official in Tokyo said the Japanese team would assess the impact on coral reefs. They will also take with them special materials designed to absorb oil. ""The oil leak from the stranded ship has caused severe damage to the people of Mauritius, the economy of which largely relies on tourism and the beautiful ocean,"" said Noriaki Sakaguchi, from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. ""I am terribly distressed. I would like to assess the situation and provide professional advice so that our contribution as an expert team will meet the demands of local people and the government."" The operation to remove the bow has so far been hampered by low tides, reports the BBC's Yasine Mohabuth in Port Louis, but it should progress as surrounding waters deepen. Meanwhile, experts are trying to decide how to remove the rear section of the vessel, which is still aground on the reef. The ship's captain, 58-year-old Sunil Kumar Nandeshwar, has been arrested over the incident and charged with endangering safe navigation. Police said crew members had told them there had been a birthday party on the ship the day it ran aground. Another theory being investigated is that the ship navigated close to the shore in order to pick up WiFi signal.

"He says his party will be ready in time for the October 2019 federal election. Mr Bernier lost the Conservative leadership race in May by a small margin to current leader Andrew Scheer. In recent weeks, he has launched Twitter attacks against PM Justin Trudeau's ""extreme multiculturalism"" and immigration policy. In front of a packed and expectant press conference on Thursday, Mr Bernier announced he is leaving the federal conservative caucus. He said he has not spoken to any other Conservative members of parliament about leaving the caucus for his as-yet unnamed party. ""I want to do politics differently,"" he said. ""I will find another way to give a voice to millions of Canadians. I will continue to fight for freedom, responsibility, fairness and respect."" He has served as a Conservative MP for the Quebec constituency of Beauce for the past dozen years, and will remain an independent MP in the House of Commons. ""I have come to realise over the past year that this party is too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed,"" he said. Mr Bernier says his decision was made in part because the party told him to ""shut up"" when he attacked Mr Trudeau's immigration and diversity policies. Mr Bernier also challenged the party's support for Canada's system of supply management in the agricultural sector, a system that has also been derided by US President Donald Trump and become a sticking point in Nafta negotiations. Mr Bernier had previously served as foreign affairs minister under the government of Stephen Harper, but resigned after it was discovered that he left confidential documents at the home of his ex-girlfriend, who had ties to organised crime figures. In response to Mr Bernier's decision to leave the party, Mr Scheer said: ""He has chosen to put himself above all things"".","Canadian MP Maxime Bernier has quit the Conservative Party of Canada and says he will form his own party devoted to ""more freedom, less government""."
"Republicans accused Mr Obama of overreach when he signed orders on healthcare and gay rights, but they have praised Mr Trump for using the same tactic to roll back Obamacare. What is an executive order? It is a written order issued by the president to the federal government which does not require congressional approval. Orders range from dramatic reverses of policy, like Mr Trump's approval for the construction of two bitterly contested oil pipelines, to ordinary business, such as Mr Obama's instructions on half-day closing for government departments on Christmas Eve 2015. Authority for issuing the orders is rooted in Article II of the US constitution, which states: ""The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America."" Why do presidents issue them? Sometimes the orders are made during wartime or to avert a domestic crisis. In February 1942, President Franklin D Roosevelt signed an executive order that led to the creation of detention centres for about 120,000 Japanese Americans. In 1952 President Harry S Truman issued an order that put the steel industry under the control of the government in an attempt to avoid a strike. Mr Obama issued his most controversial executive orders in an attempt to work around gridlock in Congress caused by intransigent Republican opposition. ""If they're not going to do anything, we'll do what we can on our own,"" he told a crowd in Kansas City in July 2014. ""That's when we act - when your Congress won't."" Who can overturn them? An executive order has to work within the confines of the law, with, in theory, each one ""reviewed by the Office of Legal Counsel for form and legality"". This does not always happen. If an order is deemed to stray outside the boundaries of what is acceptable, it can be subject to a legal review. Congress can also pass a law to override the executive order, but a president still has a veto over that law, the Constitution Center explained. Why are they politically sensitive? Executive orders are controversial because they bypass approval from Congress, allowing the president to act on his own. Republicans successfully sued Mr Obama over part of his 2010 healthcare changes, arguing that he had exceeded his constitutional authority when he unilaterally delayed an insurance coverage deadline. A president may also issue an order when members of Congress act too slowly or when the president feels he needs to flesh out details of a new law. How frequently are executive orders issued? Roosevelt issued 3,721 orders during his 12 years in office, while Mr Obama signed just 279. George W Bush issued 291 over his eight years in power. Mr Obama's was a modest total by modern standards. His average of 35 orders per year is the lowest tally since Grover Cleveland, who was president from 1885-89, and then 1893-97 - and averaged 32 orders a year.",Barack Obama used them sparingly; Donald Trump issued at least four in his first week in office: executive orders are a key tool for any US president wanting to make their mark on government policy.
"""This will not only bring the justice we have been seeking.... but it could also prevent similar acts recurring,"" Hatice Cengiz said in a statement. It comes after a US intelligence report found that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved Khashoggi's murder. Saudi Arabia has rejected the report. Crown Prince Mohammed, who is effectively the kingdom's ruler, has denied any role in the murder. Khashoggi was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in October 2018 and his body was dismembered. The 59-year-old journalist had once been an adviser to the Saudi government and close to the royal family, but he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Prince Mohammed. In his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. What did Hatice Cengiz say? ""It is essential that the crown prince, who ordered the brutal murder of a blameless and innocent person, should be punished without delay,"" Ms Cengiz said on Monday. ""If the crown prince is not punished, it will forever... endanger us all and be a stain on our humanity,"" she added. Ms Cengiz, a Turkish academic researcher, made a plea that world leaders distance themselves from the crown prince and impose punishments such as sanctions on Saudi Arabia. ""Starting with the Biden Administration, it is vital for all world leaders to ask themselves if they are prepared to shake hands with [Prince Mohammed],"" she said. ""I urge everyone to put their hands on their hearts and campaign to punish the crown prince,"" Ms Cengiz added. US President Joe Biden has faced criticism from within his own Democratic Party over his decision not to punish Prince Mohammed directly. After the intelligence report was released on Friday, his administration imposed sanctions on a senior aide to the prince as well as others who it said had played a role in Khashoggi's death. ""I think they need to keep open additional sanctions against [Prince Mohammed] if we don't see a change in behaviour,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Fox News on Sunday. Republican members of Congress have also called on Mr Biden to impose further sanctions. His administration is expected to make an announcement later on Monday. President Biden spoke to Saudi Arabia's King Salman last week and ""affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law"", the White House said. What happened to Khashoggi? The journalist, who was known for his criticism of the Saudi authorities, went to the consulate in October 2018 in order to obtain papers allowing him to marry Ms Cengiz. He had allegedly received assurances from the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, who was ambassador to the US at the time, that it would be safe to visit the consulate. Prince Khalid has denied any communication with the journalist. According to Saudi prosecutors, Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate, prosecutors said. The remains were never found. Grim details were revealed in transcripts of purported audio recordings of the killing obtained by Turkish intelligence.","The fiancée of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has called for Saudi Arabia's crown prince to be ""punished without delay"" over his killing."
"The deal was announced by Russia's President Vladimir Putin and confirmed by Turkey. The two nations, which back opposing sides, will act as guarantors. The High Negotiations Committee (HNC), regarded by the UN as Syria's main opposition body, confirmed the deal, which excludes jihadist groups. If the truce holds, peace talks will be held in Kazakhstan within a month. At least 300,000 people are believed to have been killed in fighting that followed the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. A further four million have fled the country to seek refuge in neighbouring states or Europe. How Moscow’s Syria campaign has paid off for Putin Aleppo: Before and after the battle Why is there a war in Syria? Who is included in the deal? On the one side, Syrian government forces, their factional allies and the Russian military. On the other, the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a loose alliance of several moderate rebel factions, plus other groups under the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), the umbrella group representing Syria's political and armed opposition factions. FSA spokesman Osama Abu Zaid said there were 13 armed opposition factions in all who had signed up. The Russian defence ministry listed seven of the main rebel groups included in the truce as Faylaq al-Sham; Ahrar al-Sham; Jaysh al-Islam; Thuwwar Ahl al-Sham; Jaysh al-Mujahidin; Jaysh Idlib and al-Jabhah al-Shamiyah. Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam) are the key names, neither of them part of the FSA. Who is not included? Jihadists. So-called Islamic State (IS) ""and the groups affiliated to them"" are not part of the agreement, Syria's army confirmed. It also said Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front) was excluded. However, some rebel officials told Reuters it was part of the deal, giving a hint of the complications that lie ahead. This is because JFS is intrinsically linked in Idlib province to groups that have signed up to the truce. The FSA also said that the deal did not include the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG). The YPG, along with other Kurdish militias, controls a large area of northern Syria up the Turkish border. It is regarded by Turkey as a terrorist organisation and an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). What are the terms and where does it cover? It is nominally nationwide, although that really only covers the areas where the sides who have signed up to the truce have a presence. Looking at the map, there are large swathes under both jihadist and Kurdish control. One area that is included is the rebel-held area of Ghouta in eastern Damascus, where government forces have been advancing in recent months. Announcing the deal in Moscow, Mr Putin said there were three key points: Under the terms of the deal, the peace talks would begin within a month of the ceasefire taking effect - and holding - and would be held in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana. The Kurdish YPG would not take part in the peace talks, the FSA said. How did the ceasefire come about and can it hold? Previous ceasefire initiatives this year brokered by the UN, or the US acting with Russia, quickly collapsed. But earlier this month, Russia and Turkey negotiated a ceasefire in Syria's second city, Aleppo, that led to tens of thousands of rebel fighters and civilians being evacuated from an enclave besieged by government forces. The fact that the rebels have been losing ground may help this truce. The HNC admitted on Thursday that, because of the rebels' limited resources against government forces and their allies, it was ""not possible to continue"" the fight. What has the reaction to the deal been? Mr Putin himself described the deal as ""fragile"". He said Russia would cut its military presence in Syria but made it clear Moscow would ""continue fighting international terrorism and supporting the Syrian government"". Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said there was now a ""real chance of finding a political solution"" but that the rebels taking part must distance themselves from IS and former al-Qaeda fighters. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a ""window of opportunity"" had been created that ""should not be wasted"". He vowed to continue fighting IS and ""terrorist groups"". Difficulties lie ahead in peace talks. Turkey has already called for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement - linked to Syria's ally Iran - to leave Syrian soil, which is sure to cause problems. UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, welcomed the new deal, saying he hoped it would save lives and improve aid delivery. ""These developments should contribute to inclusive and productive intra-Syrian negotiations to be convened under UN auspices on 8 February,"" he said. The US state department said the deal was a ""positive development"" which it hoped would be ""implemented and fully respected by all parties"". One rebel commander told Reuters: ""This time I have confidence in its seriousness. There is new international input."" The FSA said it would abide by the truce but would retaliate against violations by government forces and their allies. The FSA's Osama Abu Zaid said it had so far had no direct talks with the Syrian government and still insisted that President Assad would have no place in the future of Syria.",The Syrian government and rebel groups have agreed a nationwide ceasefire from midnight (22:00 GMT) on Thursday.
"Marin County Police in California said he was pronounced dead at his home shortly after officials responded to an emergency call around noon local time. Williams was famous for such films as Good Morning Vietnam and Dead Poets Society and won an Oscar for his role in Good Will Hunting. His publicist said he had been ""battling severe depression"". In the past he had talked, and even joked, about his struggles with alcohol and drugs. Williams had recently returned to a rehabilitation centre to ""fine-tune"" his sobriety, the Los Angeles Times reported in July. The local Sheriff's office said Williams was found unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco. ""At this time, the Sheriff's Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made,"" police said in a statement. In a statement, Williams's wife, Susan Schneider, said she was ""utterly heartbroken"". ""This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,"" she said. ""On behalf of Robin's family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions."" Williams had three children from previous marriages. Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1951, Williams joined the drama club in high school and was accepted into Juilliard School in New York, the prestigious American academy for the arts. There, he was encouraged by a teacher to pursue comedy. The actor was first known for his zany portrayal of an alien in the 1970s TV show Mork and Mindy, a character first seen in the sitcom Happy Days. He was a regular stand-up comedian while continuing to act in such films as Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society, Mrs Doubtfire and as the voice of the genie in Aladdin. While many of his roles were in comedies, Williams won the Oscar in 1998 for best supporting actor as a therapist in Good Will Hunting. In a 2009 interview, the actor told Reuters his children often referenced his own struggles with alcohol when he told them off for bad behaviour. ""They went: 'And you had a three-year drunken relapse'. Ah, thank you for bringing that back, my little happy creatures,"" Williams joked. In his final Instagram post two weeks ago, he published a photo of himself and his daughter as a toddler with the message: ""Happy Birthday to Ms Zelda Rae Williams! Quarter of a century old today but always my baby girl. Happy Birthday @zeldawilliams Love you!"" Fellow comedian Steve Martin tweeted he ""could not be more stunned by the loss of Robin Williams, mensch, great talent, acting partner, genuine soul."" Martin and Williams appeared on stage together during an 1988 Broadway revival of Waiting for Godot. Comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted: ""I can't believe the news about Robin Williams. He gave so much to so many people. I'm heartbroken."" Actor Danny DeVito, who worked with Williams in Death To Smoochy, said: ""So sad to think about this. Hard to speak. Hard to say. Hard to take. ""All I can think about is what a joy he was to be with. I'm devastated. My heart is broken by this news.""","US actor and comedian Robin Williams has been found dead, aged 63, in an apparent suicide."
"They detail the former president's ""incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect"" in a pre-trial brief released Tuesday. It calls for him to be disqualified from ever running for office again. Mr Trump's legal team argues that the impeachment article is in ""violation"" of the US Constitution. The storming of the Capitol occurred while Congress was meeting inside to certify the election victory of President Joe Biden. The riot led to the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer. This is Trump's second impeachment trial, and he is the first US president in history to be impeached twice. What did the House say? House impeachment managers said the former president's repeated refusal to concede the election to Mr Biden encouraged the riot. Before the armed insurrection, thousands of Trump supporters gathered at a ""Save America"" rally near the White House and listened to Mr Trump, who urged them to ""fight like hell"" because ""we won [the election] by a landslide"". Mr Trump's ""statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow"", the 80-page legal brief says. Impeachment managers plan to use Mr Trump's own words and video footage of the riot to say that ""the furious crowd"" was ""primed (and prepared) for violence if he lit a spark"". ""The evidence is clear. When other attempts to overturn the presidential election failed, former President Trump incited an attack on the Capitol,"" it reads. They argue that, although Mr Trump is no longer in office, the Senate has to act because ""a president must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last"". ""This is not a routine corruption charge,"" they wrote. ""Trump has committed an impeachable offense of historic proportions."" Unlike in the case of Mr Trump's first impeachment last year, Democrats have not indicated that they will call any witnesses. What is the Trump team's defence? In their official response to the Democrats' pre-trial brief, lawyers for Mr Trump flatly rejected next week's impeachment trial as unconstitutional and in violation of his right to free speech. They say that, because he is now a private citizen, ""the Senate of the United States lacks jurisdiction over the 45th President because he holds no public office from which he can be removed"". Members of Mr Trump's party look unlikely to convict him, given that 45 out of 50 Senate Republicans voted last week in favour of a Senate bid to dismiss the trial. Impeachment is generally used to remove a lawmaker from office, but it has also been used in the past to convict government officials who have already left office. In the days since the insurrection, Mr Trump did not accept any blame for the violence, claiming his remarks at the rally had been ""totally appropriate"". His lawyers will reiterate that firm denial, writing in the 14-page brief that ""the Article of Impeachment misconstrues protected speech and fails to meet the constitutional standard for any impeachable offense"". They also contended that when Mr Trump told his followers to ""fight like hell"", he was referring to ""election security in general"". The former president's allies have pointed out he also urged rally-goers to march to the Capitol ""peacefully"". Mr Trump's previous legal defence team bowed out last week after the former president repeatedly urged them to promote claims of election fraud, but the new team will reportedly not advance this line of argument. Republicans have indicated they will not convict Mr Trump - 45 of them voted last week in favour of a Senate effort to dismiss the trial. What happened on 6 January? Thousands of Trump supporters gathered near the White House at a rally organised to challenge the election result and listened to Mr Trump speak. In a 70-minute address, he exhorted them to march on Congress where politicians were meeting to certify Democrat Joe Biden's win. The attack began after his speech ended. Four people - three demonstrators and one police officer - died amid the violence.","Donald Trump must be convicted because he is ""personally responsible"" for the riot at the US Capitol, House Democrats have said."
"Sebastien Bras' restaurant Le Suquet returns to the directory with just two stars, having previously been awarded three. The chef's concerns over the possible inspection of every meal prompted the decision to be removed in 2017. Le Suquet's reinstatement in the 2019 Michelin guide ""left us with doubts"", he said. The restaurant guide, originally designed for motorists finding places to stop off en route, says two stars shows ""excellent cooking, worth a detour"", while three means it is ""worth a special journey"". Based in the Aubrac region, Mr Bras took over Le Suquet from his father in 2009 and prides himself on sourcing natural, local ingredients, often from the family garden. In 2017 he told AFP that the three star rating had given him ""a lot of satisfaction,"" but he dreaded knowing inspectors could appear at any time. Michelin agreed to remove Le Suquet because it was difficult ""to have a restaurant in the guide which does not wish to be in it"". ""Maybe I will be less famous, but I accept that,"" the chef said. In an interview following his re-entry, Mr Bras told Centre Press Aveyron that Michelin had made it clear a restaurant has no choice but to live under pressure. 'So many emotions' There have been disappointments elsewhere in this year's guide. The Alsace restaurant Auberge de L'Ill lost its third star after 51 years with the accolade. ""I don't know how to explain this loss,"" Chef Marc Haeberlin told France 3 Alsace television. The restaurant has been in the family for 150 years. But there was a strong emphasis on younger, female and more international chefs, with 24-year-old Julia Sedefdjian earning her first star for Paris-based, Nicoise-inspired restaurant Baieta. Stephanie Le Quellec gained a second star for her acclaimed Parisian restaurant La Scene, while Amelie Darvas was awarded a star for Äponem-Auberge du Presbytère, which is situated in an old church in the tiny village of Vailhan. Argentinian Mauro Colagreco is now the only foreigner to have three stars in France for his Mirazur eatery on the Cote d'Azur. ""So many emotions. Thank you! I'm so honoured,"" he said.","A French chef is ""surprised"" to find he is back in this year's Michelin guide, despite requesting to be taken out."
"The images - first published on websites - show what looks like a stealth fighter on a taxi run. Beijing has not commented on whether the pictures - published ahead of US Defence Secretary Robert Gates' visit later this week - are genuine. The Pentagon says China is still years away from deploying a stealth aircraft. In late 2009 the deputy head of China's air force, General He Weirong, said the country's stealth fighter would be ready sometime between 2017 and 2019, reports said. But US director of naval intelligence Vice Admiral David Dorsett said that it would be ""years"" before China's new fighter would be operational. ""Developing a stealth capability with a prototype and then integrating that into a combat environment is going to take some time,"" he said. The leaked photos of the prototype aircraft first appeared on military websites and blogs. They were said to have been taken at the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute. The images were then discussed in the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper, in both its Chinese and English-language editions, although no comment was made on their authenticity. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper said China could begin test flights of the stealth jet as soon as this month, citing unidentified Chinese military sources. Military build-up The world's only operational stealth fighter is the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, but Russia is also known to be working on its own prototype. BBC defence correspondent Nick Childs says the aircraft certainly bears a superficial resemblance to the latest US stealth designs - and that may spook some in Washington. And it will add to the concerns of those who have been warning especially of the increasing reach and capabilities of China's air force and navy, he adds. The US has been watching closely as China increases its military capacity - in particular, its development of a so-called ""carrier killer"" missile, a land-based system which could sink an aircraft carrier from up to 1,800 miles (2,900km) away. US battle groups - including aircraft carriers - are stationed in the South China Sea. And in August, the Pentagon reported that China had been expanding its nuclear arsenal and submarine force, as well as upgrading its land-based missiles.","The US is playing down pictures that appear to show a working prototype of a Chinese stealth aircraft, invisible to radar."
"By Reality Check teamBBC News So how many masks does China need, and where are they produced? How many masks does China need? Although experts are sceptical about their effectiveness, face masks are in widespread use both among the general population and medical staff. We can't know a definitive overall number as the virus spreads across China, but to give an idea of the scale of the demand, let's start by looking at the situation in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. Just dealing with medical staff alone, there are an estimated 500,000 across the province. Medical advice in China is to change face masks regularly, as often as four times a day for medical teams, which would require two million masks each day. This is the procedure being followed in one of the main hospitals in Wuhan, the largest city in Hubei province. We don't have a breakdown for the numbers of medical staff in other significantly affected provinces, but it would be reasonable to assume a similar pattern of usage, as coronavirus infections spread. Then there's the widespread use of face masks among the ordinary population, whether or not they've been instructed to do so by the authorities. It's also important to say that culturally, it's quite common for people in China to wear face masks, both as general protection and if they feel they are getting ill. So, although we can't know overall numbers of masks needed, it's clear there's already a huge demand which is only going to increase across China, particularly as people head back to work in mid-February after the New Year holiday. How many is China producing? Under normal circumstances, China produces around twenty millions masks each day. That's estimated to be around half of all masks made globally. However, Chinese production has currently been cut to around 10 million, both because of the New Year holiday as well as the impact of the virus itself. That's clearly not sufficient to meet even the current demand in China. In addition, it's the higher-quality masks which are most effective, and most needed. One type, known as the N95 respirator, is designed to filter at least 95% of airborne particles, and is more effective than an ordinary surgical or medical mask, which also needs to be changed more frequently. China currently produces each day around 600,000 of these high-quality masks, according to figures from the Ministry of Industry. One province, Zhejiang, reported on 27 January that it needed a million of these masks each day, and other provinces have said they are only just able to meet demand for these high-quality masks. In addition, hospitals don't have large stockpiles of these masks - in most cases, only enough to last two weeks. Across China, there have been reports of shortages and soaring prices, as people have rushed to buy masks. To give an idea of this demand, the Chinese online shopping site Taobao says than in just two days in January, it sold more than 80 million masks. Foxconn, maker of the Apple iPhone, has announced that it's switching part of its production to making surgical masks. It aims to produce two million masks a day by the end of February. Can China get masks from abroad? China bought 220 million face masks between 24 January and 2 February, with South Korea one of the countries supplying them. Since the beginning of February, the authorities have also removed tariffs and duties on imported medical supplies. The US firm 3M, which is a major producer of high-quality face masks, says it is making increasing numbers at facilities around the world in order to meet demand. ""We are ramping up production, including in the US, Asia and Europe, as quickly as possible,"" Jennifer Ehrlich of 3M told the BBC. The UK-based Cambridge Mask Company, which makes high-quality respirator masks, says it has faced unprecedented demand, and has completely sold out. Some countries, including Taiwan and India, have banned the export of protective clothing such as face masks. Taiwan says it wants to prioritise the protection of its own citizens, and has announced a rationing system for buying face masks. There have also been reports of shortages in countries outside China because of panic buying, as fears grow about the global spread of the coronavirus. As of 4 February, the US had just 11 confirmed cases but some retailers there had already experienced shortages, despite current guidance from the US authorities saying that they ""do not recommend the use of face masks for the general public.""

"Michel Sapin told parliament that Antoine Deltour was ""defending the general interest"". Mr Deltour is accused of passing information to a journalist. The LuxLeaks scandal cast light on how Luxembourg helped giant companies slash their global tax bills. Mr Deltour and his co-defendants could face up to 10 years in jail. The government and companies named say their tax practices are not illegal. It was the biggest leak of its kind until the Panama Papers this year showed how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth. Q&A: Panama Papers How assets are hidden and taxes dodged 'Public interest' Mr Deltour, a former auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is accused of passing information on clients to French journalist Edouard Perrin, who first broke the story on French TV in 2012, in collaboration with the BBC's Panorama. He faces charges of theft, revealing business secrets, violation of professional secrets and money laundering. Raphael Halet, another former PwC employee, is suspected of a separate leak and faces the same charges. Mr Perrin is accused of being an accomplice. Prosecutors say that together the data was later used by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in their November 2014 story. The tax breaks involved 340 companies. As he arrived for the first day of his trial, Mr Deltour told AFP news agency he was ""very calm, I acted in the public interest"". Supporters gathered outside the courtroom chanted ""thank you Antoine, thank you Antoine!"" Addressing the French parliament, Mr Sapin said he had asked the French ambassador to Luxembourg to ""assist [Mr Deltour] at this difficult time when he defends the general interest"". It was thanks to Mr Deltour, he added, that an end was being brought to the opaque system that prevented European countries finding out the tax deals made by large companies in Luxembourg. ""In turn I would like to offer him all our solidarity,"" he said. Mr Sapin has tabled a bill, due to be debated in June, which he says will promote economic transparency as well as protect the anonymity of whistleblowers. While Luxembourg has laws protecting whistleblowers, they are confined to exposing illegal practices. Civil rights groups have attacked the case. ""Deltour should be protected and commended, not prosecuted,"" said Cobus de Swardt, the Managing Director of Transparency International. Nearly 130,000 people have signed an online petition in support of Mr Deltour. The scandal put pressure on European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who led Luxembourg when many of the tax breaks were implemented. He has denied wrongdoing and has backed new EU rules to make corporate taxation more transparent.",France's finance minister has offered assistance to one of three French men who have gone on trial in Luxembourg over the leak of documents revealing corporate tax deals.
"Imagine waking up in the morning, walking down to your stylish kitchen and finding actor Tom Hiddleston making breakfast for you. It's a fantasy vitamin company Centrum is cashing in on for its new Chinese advertisement. It may have been widely mocked in the Western media, but the made-for-mobile ad has been remarkably well-received in China. 'I'm his wife' The minute-long video filmed in vertical format was posted from Hiddleston's official Weibo account on Wednesday. It's filmed from the perspective of Hiddleston's partner sitting at the table while he, decked in an apron, makes a healthy breakfast for her. He then says in Chinese 还有你的善存, which can be translated as ""here's your Centrum"", or ""don't forget your Centrum"". The Avengers' star has more than 600,000 followers on the popular Chinese social media platform, which is not a huge amount given some Chinese stars have Weibo fan counts in the millions. But the video went viral anyway and had been watched more than 2.5 million times by Friday. The Chinese word for #Centrum soon began trending - with over 32 million users interacting with the hashtag. Many expressed their glee at finding themselves the object of Hiddleston's affections, with one fan posting a quote which said: ""I'm not his fan. I'm his wife."" ""Look at the money I spent because of you, husband,"" another posted, alongside a receipt that showed she had spent 148 yuan (£16 ;$22) on Centrum. Fantasy and reality This was clearly an ad made for a very particular market, experts say. For many of his Chinese fans, waking up to a suited Hiddleston is a fantasy come to life, so the point-of-view format is a clever trick. ""Many female fans often consider their idol their imaginary boyfriend or husband,"" Professor Zhang Kuangjie of the Nanyang Technological University told the BBC. ""This ad appeals exactly to those fans' fantasies. The fact that he speaks very good Chinese [in the ad] further adds to [his] likeability."" Prof Zhang adds that the fact the video is vertical - a format made for mobile phone screens - could ""make the fans feel like they are having a virtual chat with the celebrity"", creating a more intimate experience. There's also the novelty of being served breakfast by a Western man, says Tay Guan Hin, founder of ad agency the TGH Collective. ""For a Chinese woman to be served by a man is not common in Asia, let alone a Caucasian man, so that's something that adds to that [fantasy] element,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Pfizer, which own Centrum, would not name the ad agency in China that made the film, but told the BBC it was made to ""maximise Centrum's international appeal amongst the digital-savvy generation in China"". So there is a more practical reason for the vertical format than just intimacy. ""In a mobile-savvy country like China where there are close to 900 million mobile internet subscribers, having the ad executed in a mobile-first channel makes perfect sense,"" Rezwana Manjur, Editor of Marketing Magazine, told the BBC. ""The medium [sometimes takes] a back-seat or becomes an after-thought. Centrum in this aspect, puts the consumer's content consumption [habits] at the forefront."" And though some Western viewers have called Hiddleston a sell-out, Charlotte McEleny, Asia-Pacific publisher at marketing news platform The Drum, says using celebrities in adverts is ""basically a necessity in China"". ""Hiddleston has become a big name in China due to his Marvel association... he's a great choice,"" said Ms McEleny. 'A bit voyeuristic' The ad has of course been spotted outside of China though, and ironically drew criticism for the exact same reasons it gained praise in its intended market. ""Because this vertical format forces you to be in the point of view of that woman, it feels a lot more intimate and immersive. So for some Western audiences, it might feel like it's a bit voyeuristic,"" said Mr Tay. And for some people, it was a little too close for comfort. ""Forming a support group for the victims of Tom Hiddleston's Centrum commercial,"" said one user on Twitter. ""The ad is utterly terrifying. Watch it if only to feel like you've woken up in your own home invasion nightmare,"" said another. But Charlotte McEleny from The Drum said the ad could teach brands a thing or two about China. ""Rather than calling this out for being weird or creepy, Western businesses should probably be taking notes on how to build stories into new formats.""","Creepy, uncomfortable and downright weird are just some things an advertisement starring Tom Hiddleston has been called, but none of that will matter as it's found success with its intended audience - Chinese women, as the BBC's Yvette Tan explains."
"The Active Travel Strategy wants 20% of Douglas travellers to use transport other than motor vehicles to get to work by 2021. The routes will connect the town centre with areas in a 2.5mile (4km) radius, including Onchan and parts of Braddan. The Department of Infrastructure (DoI) said the project would cost £3.8m. The scheme, which was approved by Tynwald in July 2018, will also see the refurbishment of the Douglas heritage trail. 'More liveable streets' While many of the routes are away from main roads, there are plans to encourage people to use Peel Road, Glencrutchery Road and Douglas Promenade, where cyclists and walkers ""can be segregated"" from traffic, a DoI spokesman said. The routes will see new signage and road markings alongside dropped kerbs and reduced speed limits on some roads. Infrastructure political member Kate Lord-Brenan MLC said the plan was to ensure cycling and walking were not a ""worse choice"" for people. ""If somebody does choose to walk or cycle, they should feel that there is space on the roads for them to do that,"" she said. Isle of Man Cycling's Rob Holden said the island was ""far behind"" many other places in the world, but the plans could help create ""healthier, safer and more liveable streets"".","Cycling and walking routes to encourage the Manx capital's commuters to make journeys in ""a different way than in a car"" have been outlined."
"Abdallah Chatila said he purchased the items to prevent them from being used as neo-Nazi propaganda. The Swiss-based entrepreneur donated the items - including Adolf Hitler's top hat - to Israeli fundraising organisation, Keren Hayesod. The auction had been sharply criticised by Jewish groups. Mr Chatila spent about €600,000 (£513,000) on 10 items during the auction held by the Munich-based auction house, Hermann Historica. He is one of Switzerland's 300 wealthiest people, having made his fortune in diamonds and real estate in Geneva. ""Far-right populism and anti-Semitism are spreading all over Europe and the world,"" Mr Chatila told the Swiss newspaper Le Matin Dimanche. ""I did not want these objects to fall into the wrong hands and to be used by people with dishonest intentions."" In addition to the hat, the items he purchased included Hitler's cigar box and typewriter, as well as a silver-covered edition of Hitler's autobiographical Mein Kampf. His actions were praised by Jewish groups, including the European Jewish Association (EJA), which had said the auction items held little historical value and would have been bought by individuals who glorified Nazism. Rabbi Menachem Margolin, head of the EJA, said in a statement he was ""bowled over"" by the gesture. ""In a cynical world... such a noble act of kindness, generosity and solidarity,"" he said. He also said Mr Chatila would join a visit by 100 European parliament members to the site of World War Two death camp Auschwitz in January, where he will receive an award. The auction featured 147 items specifically related to Nazi Germany, among more than 800 German historical collectibles from 1919 onwards. Hermann Historica said the majority of its customers were museums, state collections and private collectors, and that steps have been taken to prevent items from falling into the wrong hands.",A Lebanese businessman has donated items of Nazi memorabilia he bought at a controversial auction in Germany last week to Israeli fundraisers.
"Judges expressed concern that senior government figures had met Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials to suggest changes to its report. The court said the CBI had become a ""caged parrot speaking in the master's voice"", Press Trust of India reports. India lost $210bn (£134bn) by selling off coalfields cheaply, auditors say. The CBI admitted to the court last month that it had shared the confidential draft probe report with the government before submitting it to the court. Outraged opposition parties have been demanding that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Law Minister Ashwani Kumar resign for trying to influence the investigation. Mr Singh denies any wrongdoing in the scandal and has refused to quit. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court judges examined a nine-page affidavit submitted by the CBI outlining the changes that were made after the report was shown to Mr Kumar and others. The court said the CBI was supposed to ""interrogate to find out the truth"" and not to ""interact with government officials"". The CBI has said the report was shared with Attorney General GE Vahanvati, former Additional Solicitor General Harin Raval, officials in the coal ministry and the prime minister's office and the law minister. The agency has said that no names were deleted and no substantial change was made to the report. Correspondents say the controversy has raised questions over the independence of India's leading investigation agency when it looks into scandals involving government ministers and officials. The report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) into the sale of coalfields said private and state companies had benefited from the allocations between 2004 and 2010. Opposition politicians accused the government of ""looting the country"" by selling coalfields to companies without competitive bidding. The Congress-led government has been beset by corruption scandals. General elections are due next year.",India's Supreme Court has accused the government of interfering in a federal investigation into a coal scandal said to have cost India billions of dollars.
"The plane will be equipped with surveillance equipment including thermal imaging to detect poachers. It will patrol over the Kruger National Park, a vast reserve that borders Mozambique and home to two-thirds of South Africa's rhino population. So far this year 588 rhinos have been killed in South Africa, in what is being called a ""relentless onslaught"". That figure has risen from just 13 reported cases in 2007 as organised and well-armed crime syndicates target the animals. South Africa is home to the world's largest rhino population - an estimated 18,000 white rhinos and 1,700 critically endangered black rhino. The rhino horn is highly prized in traditional Asian medicine, even though there is no scientific proof of its effects. It sells for around $95,000 (£60,000) per kilo, almost twice the value of gold. The director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Jason Bell, said: ""The killing of rhinos for their horns does not exist in a vacuum, but is a complex problem where values of tradition and culture have been corrupted in the name of commercial exploitation."" ""Be it elephants and ivory, tigers and tiger parts, rhinos and rhino horn, the endpoint is the same - profit. And that profit is being chased down in the most brutal fashion by organised crime syndicates."" So far this year, South Africa has already armed some of its park rangers and deployed dog patrols to try and stop the poachers. The surveillance airplane for the Kruger National Park was donated by the Ichikowitz Family Foundation, whose chairman Ivor Ichikowitz said: ""You have to fight fire with fire."" ""This thermal imaging technology will deliver more powerful observation capability to the Kruger National Park's rangers, making it difficult for poachers to hide.""",South Africa is to deploy a reconnaissance airplane to combat a massive rise in rhino poaching.
"By Fergal KeaneBBC's Africa editor For even the most mildly superstitious souls it was an unsettling moment: the newly sworn-in president of the Democratic Republic of Congo was delivering his maiden speech when he was unable to go on. ""I am not OK,"" Felix Tshisekedi declared. Aides moved in to help and he was eventually able to resume. An adviser later reported that the new president's flak-jacket was too tight and he had felt faint. President Tshisekedi was standing near his predecessor, Joseph Kabila, whom many fear will continue to exert a powerful control over the government - a suffocating influence some have suggested after allegations, which have been denied, of a secret deal between the two. The world looked at DR Congo, suspected a big electoral fix but decided to look the other way. There was no appetite for confrontation on the part of the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), the European Union or the United States. The AU hastily convened and just as hastily abandoned a mission to DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa, that had been intended to promote a negotiated solution to the row over electoral fraud. The requests to delay the announcement of official results were ignored. US contradiction The AU was left with nothing to negotiate. For a regional body that promotes ""African solutions to African problems"" it was a humiliation. The US ambassador to Kinshasa, Mike Hammer, hailed a ""first-ever peaceful, democratic transfer of power"", in the process managing to look past the State Department's own publicly expressed concerns over the electoral process. There was no easy answer to the dilemma presented by the vote. From early on it was clear that there were not going to be large demonstrations against the government, no great manifestation of public fury to pressure the international community into action. This in part was to do with the fractured nature of the political opposition, fear of the security forces and the decision by the Catholic Church and civil society to refrain for now from large-scale mobilisation. Looking at all of this, the regional and international actors opted for what diplomats call ""stability"". In DR Congo this means a continuation of the existing muddle while hoping that it does not all collapse into disaster. For the millions of Congolese - displaced from their homes by conflict, living with dire poverty and the threat of disease, denied a share in the immense mineral wealth of their nation, bullied and preyed upon by armed groups - do not expect an amelioration of their plight any time soon. In all of this it is also worth considering what I would call the politics of preoccupation. It is not just in relation to DR Congo but also to Zimbabwe with its crackdown on dissent and Sudan in the throes of a popular uprising against the regime of President Omar al-Bashir. The last few weeks have seen deepening repression. Soldiers in Zimbabwe terrorise their fellow citizens and their counterparts in Sudan fire live ammunition into crowds. Yet the international response has been muted, to put it mildly. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called on Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa not to ""turn the clock back"". This statement was based on the assumption that the clock had moved forward in Zimbabwe since the ousting of Robert Mugabe at the end of 2017, a doubtful proposition just now. Rather than condemn the brutality in Zimbabwe, the most powerful country in the region, South Africa, called for the lifting of economic sanctions. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has his own preoccupations. There is the fight against corruption and for his political base within the governing African National Congress (ANC) where allies of his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, still lurk. Winning a handsome majority in the coming elections will strengthen Mr Ramaphosa's hand. Do not expect any emphatic foreign policy departures until he feels more secure. You may be interested in: The other major continental power, Nigeria, is facing elections in a fortnight in which President Muhammadu Buhari is running for a second term. Mr Buhari has just caused uproar by firing his chief justice, who could have played a crucial role in a disputed election result. The US, EU and the UK all sounded their displeasure. But after the example of DR Congo is there an appetite for anything more than words should the election go awry? 'Ethical intervention' In Britain foreign policy is consumed by the Brexit debate. Across the rest of the EU Brexit and a host of domestic crises have led to a turning inwards. African political problems are not a priority. How distant now the days of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's ""ethical foreign policy"" and the sight of British troops patrolling Sierra Leone. The disastrous aftermath of the Iraq war ended that brief period of ambitious interventionism. The French still maintain strong military and economic links in several African countries. But their limited, and purely rhetorical, response to the DR Congo election outcome indicates the priority of domestic issues like the ongoing ""gilets jaunes"" protests. In America, the White House and the legislators are kept busy with the Mueller investigation, the continuing border wall saga and the 2020 elections. A month ago US National Security Adviser John Bolton outlined an Africa policy aimed at challenging the expansion of Chinese, and to a lesser extent Russian influence. But with the cutbacks at the State Department under the Trump administration it is difficult to see how a more vigorous Africa policy - whatever its ideological or political focus - can be implemented. With Sudan, the Americans have other reasons to go easy on the criticism: the Bashir regime has been helpful in the fight against violent Islamist extremism. The Western powers have expressed ""deep concern"" while the AU reminded ""Sudanese political leaders of their collective responsibility to pursue constructive, peaceful avenues for addressing the country's pressing challenges"". The words have been lost in the cries and bullets on the streets. But constantly looking to what the rest of the continent or international community does or does not do fails to reflect the deeper dynamics of change on the continent. It cannot be said often enough: Africa is not a single social, political, economic or cultural entity. As the popular phrase goes, Africa is not a country. DR Congo, Sudan and Zimbabwe are each shaped by different histories, albeit with a common legacy of colonial rule. But these days there is another crucial commonality. It is what you might see as the upside of the current period of turmoil. Arc of intolerance In each country a highly organised, youth-driven and tech-savvy civil society has learned that change need not always be sponsored by mainstream politicians or foreign governments. History has taught them that politicians can promise change and deliver only more of the same or worse. The young activists of Bulawayo, Goma and Omdurman do not depend on outsiders. The post-colonial era saw too many foreign interventions that were cynical and selfish, or inadequate, fleeting or poorly thought out. Recognition of this has helped create a vigorous spirit of self-determination among today's protesters. These are the people who patiently record the terror inflicted by the Zimbabwean security forces, who are circulating flyers across Khartoum to organise demonstrations, and whose activism forced then-President Kabila to hold an election, however flawed. Nothing has been more important in African politics over the last two decades than the rise of this activist generation. That is why the counsel of despair should be avoided when contemplating the crises that have been playing out in recent weeks. A swathe of the continent is suffering from either regressive authoritarianism, flawed elections, entrenched corruption, or combinations of each. One might call it an arc of intolerance. In Cameroon, the leader of the opposition has been arrested in the wake of a highly compromised election. The authorities in Uganda are accused of persecuting charismatic politician Bobi Wine, while in Tanzania, President John Magufuli is steadily squeezing the life out of democratic opposition. East v West These are just a few examples that have produced a muted response from most of the international community. I say most because the Chinese and the Russians have always stood apart from the language of condemnation. It is common currency these days to argue that where the West steps back because of its own preoccupations China and Russia will rush in. Both Beijing and Moscow have their own agendas to pursue without even lip service to ideals of human rights and accountable government. The Gulf powers are also jostling for influence. But it risks being patronising to assume that people across the continent cannot recognise, and mobilise to counter, a new kind of exploitation when it appears. The ruling party in Zimbabwe especially needs international economic assistance to counter the catastrophe created by its own incompetence and brutal tactics. That help will not be forthcoming as long as a climate of fear continues. Nor do the Chinese or the Russians have endlessly deep pockets, or the inclination, to bankroll an inherently unstable system. But I am focusing here on a more powerful long-term agent of change. I stress long term. Does anyone imagine that the people who fought to bring an election to DR Congo will now relax and allow for despotism as usual? None that I met - from Goma in the east all the way to Kinshasa in the west - believe they will be rescued by foreigners. Likewise in Sudan and Zimbabwe there are vibrant debates taking place around the economy, education and women's rights. The activist movements are crucibles of thought as well as street protest. The activism we see is not driven by ideological or sectarian fanaticism. It is characterised above all by reason. That is no small thing in a world where ideologues have wreaked so much misery in recent decades. Activism alone cannot solve the legacy of decades of misrule and corruption. But what it has created is a growing sense of democracy as something more expansive and inclusive than a ballot box that can be stuffed with fake votes or stolen by a power elite. DR Congo's pro-democracy activist group, Lucha, which was a target of Mr Kabila's violent crackdown, recently expressed the tireless hope of its activism in a tweet. ""In this tumultuous period, our people must redouble their efforts and vigilance. We must be even more demanding to make the policies accountable to us. Regardless of our political affiliation or our ethnic identity, we must put the nation above all.""",Recent crackdowns in several African countries have been met with a muted response from the international community.

"More than 80 of those at the concert were killed when several gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert venue. The band members were unhurt but Nick Alexander, a Briton selling merchandise at the gig, was among those killed. On Friday, the group issued a short Facebook statement saying: ""Our thoughts are with all of the people involved in this tragic situation."" Eagles of Death Metal were playing in the French capital as part of a European tour. The band have now cut the tour short and have returned to the US. The raucous rock 'n' roll band were formed by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme and his childhood friend Jesse Hughes. Homme was not on the tour. Their support act Red Lemons posted a message saying: ""Guys... I don't know what to say. We're more than lucky."" They added: ""Thinking about those who passed away and who were having such a love (sic) time & happiness with all of us just a minute before."" Eagles of Death Metal released their first full LP in 2004 and have been described as ""a mash-up of punk, rockabilly and Rolling Stones-style boogie"". The group's latest album Zipper Down, which came out last month, reached number 59 in the US Billboard chart and number 32 in the UK. Their songs have been used in advertisements for the likes of Nike, Acura and Microsoft. Jesse Hughes is a hard-living frontman who is also an ordained minister and a former journalist and speechwriter for the Republican Party. Meanwhile, U2 cancelled their concert in Paris on Saturday. In a statement, the Irish band said: ""We watched in disbelief and shock at the unfolding events in Paris and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families across the city tonight. ""We are devastated at the loss of life at the Eagles of Death Metal concert and our thoughts and prayers are with the band and their fans. And we hope and pray that all of our fans in Paris are safe."" Foo Fighters, who were due to perform in Paris on Monday, have also called off the remaining dates of their European tour. ""In light of this senseless violence, the closing of borders, and international mourning, we can't continue right now,"" the band said in a statement. Motorhead have also announced the postponement of a Paris concert scheduled for Sunday.","US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were not injured in the attack on their Paris concert, it has been confirmed."
"By Jessica MurphyBBC News, Quebec City Now, the community is turning to introspection. Questions are being raised in the province around radicalisation and whether there is a climate of intolerance that needs to be addressed. On Monday, Alexandre Bissonette, a 27-year-old University of Laval student, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder. Police have not said what motivated the alleged attacker, who opened fire at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre during evening prayers. Quebec attack: Who were the victims? Quebec Muslims 'emotionally destroyed' Who is Alexandre Bissonnette? But there are reports that Mr Bissonette expressed anti-immigration and anti-feminist views online. Francois Deschamps, an official with an advocacy group, Welcome to Refugees, said the suspect was known for those views online. Vivek Venkatesh, a professor with Montreal's Concordia University who studies online hate and radicalisation, says social media creates ""echo chambers"", where more extreme views can gain traction. He says while Quebec is ""still reeling"" from the mosque shooting, it is important that there be a public debate in the province on how to prevent radicalisation and violent extremism in all its forms. Pierre Martin, a political science professor with the University of Montreal, says that it appears Mr Bissonette may have been influenced by a mix of global nationalist trends, the so-called ""alt-right"", and ""currents within Quebec itself"". Trump’s shock troops: Who are the ‘alt-right’? In the 1960s, Quebec shifted quickly from a highly religious society to a deeply secular culture. ""People (now) tend to be critical of religion in general and how religion shapes people's social interactions,"" he said. He said Quebecers tend to reject overt displays of religion. For example, the province has debated in the past few years whether government workers should be allowed to wear clothing that showed their faith, like hijabs or turbans. Mr Martin said the current provincial Liberal government is seen as being overly permissive on the issue while the opposition ""have tended to be criticised for seizing some currents of resentment and exploiting them for political purposes"". But he says the fact that thousands of Quebecers attended candlelight vigils on Monday showed ""that the large majority of people who may have even traces of reservations about ostentatious displays of religion in the public sphere are extremely tolerant of private observance"". Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard echoed that on Tuesday, telling journalists that while ""all societies live with demons and our society is not perfect"", the majority of the province is open to newcomers. Still, many in Quebec City's Muslim community have said over that past two days that they have concerns about Islamophobia in the province. Amira Elghawaby, with the National Council of Canadian Muslims, says that in Quebec, recent debates around the niqab - like whether to ban the wearing of the face veil while offering or receiving public services - have been ""toxic"" and contributed to the mischaracterisation of Muslims as the ""other.""",The shock from Sunday night's deadly the Quebec mosque shooting is slowly waning.
"Then came a hail of bullets that left five police officers dead and several others injured. The days of bloodshed left Americans reeling, and yet again questioning how to mend the fractured relationship between US police officers and many black Americans. Among them were police officers across the country, for whom this anguish was all too familiar. ""My heart is heavy, I feel like I've been punched in the stomach repeatedly,"" says one serving police sergeant based in Ohio, who asked to remain anonymous. ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle right now, people want me dead for my occupation."" As people struggled to understand how to stop the violence, attention also turned to the tension and threat many police officers say they operate under. Current and former officers described how they felt vulnerable and under siege amid heightened community suspicion. ""I've been a cop for 14 years... Never did I ever feel under threat back then as I do now,"" the Ohio police sergeant says. ""The past two years have been the worse of my career with threats and people attempting to make promises of those threats. ... I knew that this could happen, I knew people wanted me dead, but never had something like this happen before. Yesterday's thoughts are today's reality."" For Gerard Kane, a retired New York Police Department (NYPD) sergeant, the week's events brought back painful memories. He was with a fellow officer who was pushed of a roof during a struggle with a suspect following a robbery at a McDonald's back in 1989. ""I am physically sick over this,"" he says. ""I am a 9/11 survivor and was with an officer killed in the line of duty in 1989, and these events have caused the emotions I felt in 1989 and 2001 to come flooding back."" The massacre in Dallas is the worst mass shooting of police officers since 1932, and brought the number of on-duty officers shot and killed this year to 26 . As a comparison, on average between three and four officers have been killed annually in the UK since World War Two, excluding those killed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. More than a third of those shot in the US in 2016 have died in ambush attacks, concealed or surprise assaults designed to catch them off guard. But Graham Campbell, another former NYPD officer, says Dallas was a particularly hard hit for those who work in law enforcement. ""Being killed in the line of duty is a fact of life for cops and they take the job knowing that,"" he says. ""I think though that most cops feel that they can do things to mitigate this risk through tactics and their ability to talk to people. ""What makes this different is that there's nothing to mitigate this. Cops have been ambushed when they arrived at calls sure, but this is different again. It was at an event that they were ordered to be at."" As officers across the country turned up for their shifts in the days that followed, many were facing the reality of how much work needs to be done to heal the rifts with the communities they work in. Protests against the deaths of Philando Castile in Minnesota, and Alton Sterling in Louisiana continued across the US over the weekend. In some places they broke out into sporadic clashes and culminated in the arrest of hundreds of activists. ""I'm a black man, I get the frustration and the anger [about shootings by police],"" says a serving police sergeant, who leads a small team of officers in Michigan but spoke on the condition of anonymity because his force does not permit him to speak openly to the media. ""Unfortunately there have been some officers who have screwed up... there are officers who should not be doing this job. There's no doubt about that. ""But people have to understand you can't taint all officers with the same brush."" He says officers feel unsupported by city officials and politicians, who he says are too quick to question use of force before understanding the facts of a case. And police often feel vilified by the communities they serve. ""I too am someone's son, someone's uncle, and at the end of the day, when I take off the uniform I'm still a black man,"" he says. ""For me it's hard. I know the job I do…. People should support black officers but I feel ridiculed, mocked and degraded for what I do by my own people. ""They expect us to be punching bags. They expect us to be more human than they are. But we too have emotions. I do not come to work to be a punching bag, I come to work to keep the peace."" As many struggled to see the right way forward, some officers warned of the effects of escalating anxiety. Robert T Christensen, a former police officer in Kalamazoo, Michigan, now teaches about the use of force at a police academy. He says increasing media focus on cases of excessive police violence, especially towards minorities, is leaving officers questioning their positions. ""Police feel like, 'Why should I even try? ... Do I really want to go to work? I'm hated because of the few bad decisions by other police officers across the country.' ""It's a war on police fuelled by hatred and a systemic problem of police officers using deadly force in questionable circumstances."" Watching video footage of the Dallas officers ""dropping like flies"" left him with a sense of desperation about the whole country's future. ""I felt like the fabric of our nation was being ripped apart in front of my eyes. We seem to be so divided on every level, and it's everybody's fault,"" he says. ""But murder is not the answer. Gunning down police officers is not the answer. It's only going to make things worse and create conflict, anxiety and fear among the police and the general public."" Graham Campbell says there is a ""desperate need"" for more dialogue between police officers and the community. ""I think that people don't understand what cops really see day in and day out. And that cops often lose sight of the vast majority of good and hardworking people who they serve."" Without this, he is worried about more violence in the future. ""I think that situations where cops are killed do make them more cautious and apprehensive, which can lead to the use of force,"" he says. ""[As an officer] you can use your brain 80% of the time to get out of trouble. ""But I think the latest events will probably mean less patience for people yelling 'Hands up don't shoot' at crime scenes.""",The evening started peacefully. Dallas police officers tweeted photos of themselves alongside protesters demonstrating against the police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota.
"The court also found a fourth man guilty of the incident and jailed him for life, says Xinhua news agency. The short report gave no further details of the hijack incident. In June, state media reported a hijacking in Xinjiang on a Tianjin airlines plane from Hotan bound for Urumqi. In that incident state media reported that police detained six hijackers, members of the Muslim Uighur minority. Two of those hijackers were reported by the Global Times newspaper to have died from injuries sustained in a fight as they tried to break into the plane's cockpit. Almost half of Xinjiang's residents are Uighurs, a Muslim minority group with cultural and ethnic links to Central Asia.","A court in China's restive Xinjiang region has sentenced three men to death for attempting to hijack a plane in June, state-run media report."
"The opposition-controlled assembly passed the bill after a heated discussion late on Tuesday. President Nicolas Maduro said he would block the bill, which he argued would benefit ""criminals and terrorists"". The opposition won the parliamentary elections in December on a promise to work towards the release of dozens of what it considers political prisoners. Among the more than 70 detainees who could be freed if the bill becomes law is Leopoldo Lopez, a prominent opposition leader who was sentenced to 13 years and nine months in prison last year for inciting violence during mass protests. Leopoldo Lopez: Venezuela's maverick opposition leader Venezuela opposition pushed for Maduro's exit What changes will the new Congress bring? The prosecutor in the case later fled Venezuela and told media abroad that Mr Lopez's conviction had been a political show trial. But government officials maintain Mr Lopez is responsible for the violence which erupted during the 2014 protests in which 43 people on both sides of the political divide were killed. 'Free Venezuela' Mr Lopez's wife, Lilian Tintori, welcomed the passing of the bill, saying it was ""felt in all of Venezuela, like a fireworks rocket going off in Caracas, full of emotion, freedom and strength"". ""Today, with this amnesty law, we're taking a major step towards the rescue of democracy and liberty,"" she said. ""We're going to free not just the political prisoners but the whole of Venezuela,"" she added. Other political leaders who could be freed are the former mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, who is under house arrest, and the former mayor of San Cristobal, Daniel Ceballos. But members of the governing PSUV party said the amnesty was a carte blanche for ""murderers"". President Maduro spoke on national television while the debate was still under way to say he would veto it. ""You can be certain that that law will not be making it through here,"" he said. Legal battle ahead Under the Venezuelan constitution, the president can send a bill back to the National Assembly, but the latter can override the veto with an absolute majority (half of those present at the time of the vote plus one). President Maduro could also send the bill to the Supreme Court if he has doubts about its constitutionality. Critics of the government say the top court is stacked with supporters of the president and could therefore pose a serious threat to the bill becoming law. Socialist lawmakers backed President Maduro in his rejection of the bill. ""There's going to be justice here and everyone who is in jail for corruption, for murder or for violating the constitution or the law will stay locked up,"" Dario Vivas said. Venezuela is deeply divided into those who support the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro and those who oppose it. Last month, the opposition announced it would try to drive President Maduro from power by means of a recall referendum or a constitutional amendment to shorten his term. The government denounced the plans as an attempted coup.",The Venezuelan National Assembly has passed an amnesty bill which could free dozens of jailed opposition leaders.
"By Guy De LauneyBBC News, Zagreb ""His reaction was complete delight,"" she says. ""He just took it and immediately said: this is familiar."" The book in question is called My Rainbow Family. At first glance it looks like many other publications aimed at pre-school children - heavy on full-page, colourful illustrations and light on text. But it quickly becomes apparent that something different is going on here. For starters, it can be read from the back or the front - as there are two different stories which meet in the middle. And then there are the characters. A little girl with two fathers. And a young boy with two mothers. It is the first time that a children's book in Croatia has depicted families with same-sex parents. And for people like Zrinka, who has been in a civil partnership since 2014, it is a welcome reflection of life in her family. ""We're very happy,"" she says. ""Patrik picks his own books for a bedtime story. Since he got this one, it's always in his favourite two or three. We didn't explain anything about it to him, he just took it. He says, 'I want to read the book about me, about my family'."" My Rainbow Family may be a source of joy to Zrinka and her family. But it is a direct challenge to conservative organisations backed by the Catholic Church. Five years ago, they forced a referendum which blocked the then-government's plans to legalise same-sex marriage. Now they are taking aim at a children's picture-book. One organisation, Vigilare, says its mission is to ""promote the original (natural) identity of marriage… between a man and a wife in which children are raised"". It called My Rainbow Family ""homosexual propaganda"" and urged the education minister to ban it from schools. Vigilare did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Senada Selo-Sabic of Zagreb's Institute for Development and International Relations says there has been a resurgence in conservative forces since Croatia joined the European Union, five years ago. ""Croatia made a mistake during the EU accession process - we silenced and marginalised everyone who didn't agree with this course of action. The political parties created this image of Croatia being very liberal, progressive and egalitarian. But in reality, it was only one side of the story."" Rising nationalism The opposition to a book featuring same-sex parents is just one of the symptoms. There has also been an increase in extreme nationalism and even incidents of Holocaust denial. A plaque with a fascist slogan was installed near the site of the Jasenovac World War Two concentration camp; it took the authorities almost a year to remove it. Senada Selo-Sabic says it is a worrying time. ""I hope that what we now see as an upheaval of conservatism is simply a reaction to the silencing period they were subject to - and that this will die down in the future. Otherwise, we are really doomed."" But the publisher of My Rainbow Family prefers to be optimistic. Daniel Martinovic, one of the co-founders of Croatia's Rainbow Families support group for same-sex parents, says positive responses to the book have not been limited to minority groups. ""When we first made the book, we only printed 500 copies, because we thought it would mostly be for us, our friends and supporters. But since the story went public we have had lots of parents saying: 'we are not LGBT, but we would really like a copy of the picture-book so we can show our children and discuss themes of equality, tolerance and diversity'."" ""Maybe this gives us hope for a change - that we'll move towards a more tolerant society."" The reaction of the education minister lends weight to Mr Martinovic's suggestion that while Catholic ""family"" groups might be noisy, they represent fewer Croatians than the ""silent majority"" for whom they claim to speak. Blazenka Divjak ignored an open letter from Vigilare and said that parents had the right to decide whether or not their children should be able to read My Rainbow Family. Compare that to Britain in the 1980s. Kenneth Baker, the education secretary under Margaret Thatcher, objected to the publication of the first English-language children's book to feature same-sex parents. He called Jenny Lives With Eric and Martin ""blatant homosexual propaganda"" - perhaps an inspiration to Vigilare, more than 30 years later. Attitudes have changed in Britain. And Zrinka Znidarcic is convinced increasing openness will pay dividends in Croatia, with My Rainbow Family playing a role in reducing the negative comments about same-sex parents. ""I have never had a bad experience when people find out I have a wife and family,"" she says. ""The best way to change minds is to be civilised, give them a chance to meet us and interact like normal human beings."" .","Zrinka Znidarcic has a new picture-book for her two-year-old son, Patrik. And she can hardly contain her excitement."
"The emeritus Pope, as he is now known, addressed the issue in a detailed letter to a prominent atheist, which also covered many other matters. It is thought to be the first time that Benedict has publicly rejected personal responsibility for covering up abuse. Some critics say he must have known of efforts to protect abusive priests. Benedict's letter, to the professor of mathematics Piergiorgio Odifreddi, was published in La Repubblica newspaper after the professor sought the former Pope's permission. His comments are the first to be released publicly since he left office, saying he would retreat to a life of prayer. He was apparently concerned not to have a public role that might impinge on his successor, Pope Francis. 'Source of suffering' Regarding the repeated allegations of abuse which arose during his pontificate, Benedict denied he had suppressed investigation of paedophile priests. And, while admitting the horror of abuse, he insisted priests had no greater tendency to paedophilia than anyone else. He wrote: ""I never tried to cover up these things. That the power of evil penetrates to such a point in the interior world of the faith is, for us, a source of suffering. ""On the one hand we must accept that suffering, and on the other, at the same time, we must do everything possible so that such cases aren't repeated. ""It's also not a motive for comfort to know that, according to sociological research, the percentage of priests guilty of these crimes is no higher than in other comparable professional categories. ""In any event, one must not stubbornly present this deviance as if it were a nastiness specific to Catholicism."" His comments were a direct response to points made in Prof Odifreddi's 2011 book Dear Pope, I'm Writing to You, which in turn was a response to Benedict's Introduction to Christianity. Benedict also responds to several other criticisms made by the Italian, including whether theology can be considered a science, and what can be known about Jesus as an historical figure. Prof Odifreddi said he appreciated the tone of his dialogue with Benedict, and that, while they might disagree on almost everything, they at least had one aim in common: ""The search for the truth, with a capital 'T'.""","The former Pope, Benedict XVI, has denied any role in covering up child sex abuse by priests, in his first public comments since retirement."
"The Roman and Celtic coins, which date from the 1st Century BC, were found by two metal detector enthusiasts. Dr Philip de Jersey, a former Celtic coin expert at Oxford University, said the haul was ""extremely exciting and very significant"". He said each individual coin was worth between £100 and £200. The exact number of coins found has not been established, but archaeologists said the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain about 50,000 coins. The exact location of the hoard has not been revealed by the authorities but Environment Minister, Deputy Rob Duhamel, said he would do everything he could to protect the site. ""Sites like these do need protection because there is speculation there might even be more,"" he said. ""It is a very exciting piece of news and perhaps harks back to our cultural heritage in terms of finance. It was found under a hedge so perhaps this is an early example of hedge fund trading."" It was found by Reg Mead and Richard Miles in a field in the east of Jersey. They had been searching for more than 30 years after hearing rumours a farmer had discovered silver coins while working on his land. Mr Mead and Mr Miles worked with experts from Jersey Heritage to slowly unearth the treasure. A large mound of clay containing the coins has now been taken to a safe location to be studied. It is the first hoard of coins found in the island for more than 60 years. Several hoards of Celtic coins have been found in Jersey before but the largest was in 1935 at La Marquanderie when more than 11,000 were discovered. Dr de Jersey said it would take months for archaeologists to find out the full value of the haul. He said: ""It is extremely exciting and very significant. It will add a huge amount of new information, not just about the coins themselves but the people who were using them. ""Most archaeologists with an interest in coins spend their lives in libraries writing about coins and looking at pictures of coins. ""To actually go out and excavate one in a field, most of us never get that opportunity. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity."" The ownership of the coins is unclear. Mr Mead said he had asked the States of Jersey for clarification. Deputy Duhamel said the owners of the site had indicated they would like to see the whole hoard on display at the Jersey Museum or the archive.","One of Europe's largest hoards of Iron Age coins has been unearthed in Jersey and could be worth up to £10m, according to an expert."
"Some 10,000 women and girls were made to do unpaid manual labour in laundries run by Roman Catholic nuns in Ireland between 1922 and 1996. More than a quarter of those who spent time in the laundries had been sent there by the Irish state. Mr Kenny apologised to all the women affected. He said their experiences had cast a ""long shadow"" over Irish life and that it had been ""humbling and inspiring"" to meet them. ""For 90 years Ireland subjected these women, and their experience, to a profound indifference,"" he said. ""By any standards it was a cruel and pitiless Ireland, distinctly lacking in mercy. ""We swapped our public scruples for a solid public apparatus."" The Irish government is to ask the Law Reform Commission's president, Judge John Quirke, to carry out a three-month review to recommend the criteria for providing support and payments to the survivors. The terms of reference were published on Tuesday evening. An emotional Mr Kenny concluded his speech to a standing ovation in the Irish parliament. The ovation was given to the survivors who were present in the public gallery. Mr Kenny concluded his speech by referring to a song Whispering Hope that had been sung by one of the women present in his recent meetings with the survivors. He said one of the lines from the song had remained in his mind. ""When the dark midnight is over, watch for the breaking of day,"" he said. One of the survivors, Mary Smyth, said Mr Kenny's emotion had shown he believed them. Steven O'Riordan of Magdalene Survivors Together said he was pleased that compensation had been proposed. Justice for Magdalenes said it welcomed Mr Kenny's apology on behalf of the Irish state. It said it looked forward ""to the intent of the apology being made evident by the introduction of a system of redress that is prompt, open, fair, and transparent"". Earlier this month, Mr Kenny expressed regret for the stigma and conditions suffered by women who were inmates in the laundries, but he stopped short of a formal government apology. In the two weeks since, Mr Kenny has held face-to-face meetings with some of those who worked in the laundries. Mr Kenny said on Tuesday that the state apology and any Irish government fund would extend to residents of laundries not included in the McAleese report. The Irish deputy Prime Minister (Tanaiste), Eamon Gilmore, said he wanted to tell the survivors that ""we have heard you, we believe you, and we are profoundly sorry for what was done to you"". An inquiry chaired by Senator Martin McAleese found more than 2,000 women and girls were sent to the laundries by the state authorities, and many Irish institutions, such as the army and some government departments, had contracts with the laundries. Women were forced into Magdalene laundries for a crime as minor as not paying for a train ticket, the McAleese report found. The report also confirmed that a police officer could arrest a girl or a woman without warrant if she was being recalled to the laundry or if she had run away. Fianna Fail has called for the establishment of a dedicated unit within the Department of Justice to co-ordinate the Irish Republic's response to the McAleese report, including all forms of redress for the survivors. 'Suffering' Its leader Micheál Martin said on Tuesday that he acknowledged the failure of all who had participated in public life in the past and had not acted to ""intervene sooner"" to apologise to the survivors. He said that as a member of the previous government, he was ""sorry"" that had not happened ""over the past decade"". The system was the subject of a 2002 film, The Magdalene Sisters, which starred Geradline McEwan and Anne-Marie Duff, whose director said at the time he believed the former inmates should have received an apology. Earlier on Tuesday, Amnesty International accused the Irish government of ignoring women who were exploited in laundries that operated across the border in Northern Ireland. Patrick Corrigan, the human rights charity's Northern Ireland director, said: ""Magdalene laundries operated in Northern Ireland into the 1980s. ""I have spoken with women survivors of these institutions who now fear being left behind, with no inquiry in place - north or south - into their suffering."" The Good Shepherd Sisters ran laundries in Belfast, Newry and Londonderry. Another Magdalene asylum, including steam laundry, was operated by the Church of Ireland on Belfast's Donegall Pass.","The Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach), Enda Kenny, has formally apologised on behalf of the state for its role in the Magdalene laundries."
"When Joko Widodo (also known as Jokowi) won Indonesia's presidential election earlier this year, supporters of his rival, former army general Prabowo Subianto, took to the streets and the ensuing violence left several dead. Five bitter months since the vote The election campaign had been angry, peppered with accusations of fraud, and it was only in the summer, in June, that Indonesia's constitutional court finally ended the political uncertainty to uphold Mr Widodo's win. But just months after that, student protests hit the streets of Indonesia, prompted by a controversial and draconian criminal code being considered by parliament. They morphed into something bigger, an expression of anger and despair with the government. Protesters also rejected the passing of a new anti-corruption law which they thought undermined the country's beloved anti-corruption agency. Those protests also left several dead and, although the vote on the code was postponed, the bitterness is still evident. Everybody watched to see how Mr Widodo would respond and what that might tell us about the state of democracy in Indonesia for the next few years. In some ways, the answer came this week with the appointment of Mr Subianto as defence minister. Quite apart from being his rival in Indonesia's two most recent presidential elections, he is a controversial figure with a tainted record on human rights. Jokowi, as the president is known, was seen as a self-made ""man of the people"" when he first came to power in 2014 - mild-mannered, jocular and with a well-documented love of heavy metal music and taking selfies. But the years have shown him willing to make harsh political compromises and, despite serious challenges to Indonesia's stated values of religious tolerance and social cohesion in recent years, his priorities remain infrastructure, economic reform and political stability. This appointment can be seen as prioritising such goals as he eyes a tangible legacy at the end of his second and final term. ""You don't see a lot of real reform-minded figures in the cabinet, the type of figures that would really give a sign to any liberals in Indonesia that the government is paying attention to issues of democracy and human rights,"" says researcher Alexander Raymond Arifianto of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""The government is just going to pave the way for status quo while they're promoting all these higher priority projects in economy and infrastructure development."" Who is the rival-turned-ally? Prabowo Subianto, 68, was born into a family steeped in Indonesian political privilege, the son of Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, an economic whiz who held ministerial posts from the 1950s to the 1970s. His father went into exile for a decade from 1957 because of his alleged involvement with a separatist group in the region of Sumatra. Mr Subianto followed as his family fled to a number of European cities, including Zurich and London. Mr Subianto eventually married the second daughter of the late authoritarian president Suharto - a move some in the military have argued helped his swift rise. But by that time, allegations were already swirling of his involvement in bloody military operations in East Timor. He was eventually dismissed from the army for his role in the abduction and murder of student activists in 1998. His human rights record did not go unnoticed by the West, with the United States denying him visa in mid-2000s and 2014. Australia also once put him on a blacklist. But Mr Subianto nevertheless made an extraordinary political comeback - although his four attempts to be leader ended in failure. And Mr Widodo's decision to add him to his cabinet, just months after his latest defeat, has dismayed many of the president's supporters. ""[Jokowi's] rival in the presidential election, who lost because the people rejected intolerance, anti-democratic [values], and human rights violations, is instead placed on an honourable position in the cabinet. We understand that there is a deep disappointment among Jokowi volunteers,"" says Handoko, general secretary of Projo, a Jokowi supporters group. So why did he do it? ""Prabowo is an intelligent individual who speaks multiple languages and will certainly be helpful when it comes to defence diplomacy,"" says Aaron Connelly, research fellow on Southeast Asian politics at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore. ""But the biggest risk is that tension between Jokowi and Prabowo will not subside, but only get greater as the relationship is not built on mutual trust and respect."" Yet the hope is that he will bring political stability to the president's last term after five years of relentless attacks from his rivals, says Mr Arifianto. Mr Widodo has made it clear that his priority is going to be infrastructure and economic reform, signalling his goal to be the country's next ""Father of Development"", a title once held by Suharto, Indonesia's last dictator and his new colleague's father-in-law. So such stability will be prized. He also picked the co-founder of homegrown ride-hailing firm Gojek to head the education ministry and a media tycoon for a state-owned enterprises post. But this is cold comfort for those worried about Indonesia's direction when it comes to human rights and social inequality. ""Prabowo's appointment sends a worrying signal that our leaders have forgotten the darkest days and the worst violations committed in the Suharto era. When Prabowo was at the helm of our special forces, activists disappeared and there were numerous allegations of torture and other ill-treatment,"" said Usman Hamid, Amnesty International Indonesia's executive director. Mr Subianto has consistently said that he only followed orders from his chiefs and that he was scapegoated by the military, including by former army general-turned-politician Wiranto, who also happened to be Mr Widodo's first-term security affairs minister Mr Widodo's strategy appears to favour compromise over confrontation - and that has resulted in a broad cabinet that involves several top generals whose potential bickering might create an enormous distraction to the president, Mr Connelly said. But the choice of Subianto could pave the way for the politicisation of the armed forces and police, a feature of Suharto's 32-year rule. As an example of this, there are regional leader posts currently held by active police officers, according to Titi Anggraini, director of Jakarta-based Association for Election and Democracy. Military encroachment into civil spaces was among the features rejected by the student movement of 1998 - the student-led demonstrations that led to the fall of Suharto. Mr Subianto did nothing to quell the violent protest to reject the elections result that erupted in his name. The fear remains that his approach to resolve any tensions that might arise with the president could be just as unorthodox - despite the smiles for selfies.","The election which saw Indonesia's social media-savvy and heavy metal-loving president Joko Widodo re-elected also saw bitter accusations of fraud from his long-time rival for the job. Just months later, that rival has joined government and the pair are posing for selfies. What does this mean?"
"With 88% of the votes counted, he has 39.1%, just short of the 40% needed to win outright in the first round. If he fails to reach 40%, he will face conservative candidate Guillermo Lasso in a run-off on 2 April. Third-placed candidate Cynthia Viteri said she would support Mr Lasso in the case of a second round. Polls conducted before the election suggested that Mr Lasso could win a second round if he got the backing of candidates eliminated in round one. Mr Moreno needs to both win 40% of the vote and have a 10-percentage-point lead over the next candidate to stave off a second round. He currently has a 10.8-percentage-point lead but not the 40%. Final results could take up to three days to be announced. Why does it matter? After 10 years in power and three election wins, incumbent left-wing President Correa was not running again, so change at the top was inevitable. But a defeat for Mr Moreno, who has the backing of Mr Correa and his party, would signal a swing to the right after a decade of left-wing policies and could have implications not just for Ecuador but the region. When Mr Correa was first elected in 2007, he was one of a group of left-wing leaders in power in Latin America, including Argentina's Nestor Kirchner, Bolivia's Evo Morales, Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Cuba's Raul Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. Some observers spoke of a ""pink tide"" sweeping across the continent. A decade on, Argentina and Brazil are led by conservative presidents, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces a hostile legislative and Evo Morales is on his last term after Bolivians rejected a proposal to change the constitution to allow him to run again. All eyes are now on Ecuador to see which way it turns. Who is the man in the lead? Lenin Moreno, 63, served as Mr Correa's vice-president from 2007 to 2013 and has been one of his close allies although he has recently sought to distance himself slightly from the outgoing leader. Observers say his style is less confrontational than that of Mr Correa and they suspect Mr Moreno may try to jettison some aspects of his predecessor's socialist policies. As vice-president, Mr Moreno, who became paraplegic after being shot in the back in 1998, set out to improve the rights of people with disabilities. Not only did he give motivational talks, he also published books on humour and happiness with titles proclaiming: ""Being Happy is Easy and Fun"". Most recently, he served as UN Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility. Among his main campaign promises are increasing employment opportunities and ensuring that all Ecuadoreans have the chance to go on to higher education. Who could beat him to the top job? His main rival is centre-right businessman and former presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso. The 61-year-old is running for the Creando Oportunidades (Creating Opportunities) party. A banker, Mr Lasso wants to create a million jobs by promoting foreign investment and has promised to cut taxes for big companies. He also has plans to make Ecuador's central bank independent of the government. The youngest of 11 children, he says he wants to ""create an Ecuador with opportunities for all"". Why is Julian Assange following the election? The WikiLeaks founder has tweeted a link to a live page on the results and has himself posted updates on the count. Mr Assange has been living inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London for more than four years for fear of extradition to the United States after he published leaked documents. But if Mr Lasso were to win the election, Mr Assange's time at the embassy could come to an end very soon as Mr Lasso has pledged to evict him within 30 days of taking office. Mr Moreno has indicated he will allow let Mr Assange stay. What awaits the winner? The eventual winner of the election will be sworn in to a four-year term in May. Economic recovery is likely to be a top priority. The oil-exporting country has suffered from a drop in international oil prices and has seen its GDP contract 1.7% in 2016. Corruption is another major problem with officials from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht recently revealing that they paid close to $35.5m in bribes to Ecuadorean officials in exchange for contracts. In foreign policy, the new president will have to deal with US President Donald Trump and his potentially more protectionist economic policies.",Partial official results in Ecuador's presidential election have put governing party candidate Lenin Moreno in the lead.
"The Manx BirdLife charity said 113 different species were seen between Christmas and New Year compared with 111 last year. Sightings reported across the island included stonechats, robins and cormorants and a kingfisher. A spokesman said the Christmas Bird Race will help to build a detailed picture of Manx bird life in December.

"One man said a bag of flour in the city - which was taken over by so-called Islamic State (IS) militants in January 2014 - now costs $850. One family reportedly lived off grass during a four-day escape bid. As the Iraqi army and allied forces, backed by coalition air strikes, attempt to recapture the city, aid agencies say Falluja's residents - as many as 50,000 people - have no safe routes out and are likely to be caught in the crossfire. 'No food at all' ""Food and medicines are in extremely short supply in the city. Some families have been going through garbage for food,"" the UN refugee agency's Caroline Gluck in Baghdad told the BBC. ""Some people were so desperate that they committed suicide. Children are showing signs of trauma, they're clearly terrified."" Baahjet Ibrahim, an imam who has escaped and is in a refugee camp in Barzinjah, told the BBC: ""Those who are inside cannot leave and those who are outside cannot help them. ""There is no food at all. A sack of flour costs a million dinars ($850, £580) and more. ""We demand that the security forces act with professionalism and dignity, like all the armies in the world, to let people escape, to receive and respect them, because there are children, elderly and sick people among them,"" Mr Ibrahim said. Hiding in drainage pipes Escape from the city is fraught with dangers, those who have managed to flee say. ""[Civilians] have survived on dried dates and hot water from the river,"" says Becky Bakr Abdullah of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). ""They also tell me about an extremely dangerous escape where they have run in groups of 15 to 16 families, often barefoot, during the night carrying the elderly and sick with children. ""Along the way they have had to hide in big drainage pipes and raise white flags in order not to be shot at. Ms Gluck says the UNHCR was told of a family of six who ""spent four days hiding in a river, escaping from IS, waiting to be collected by the security forces, and they were forced to eat grass."" ""It's very clear that people are taking extreme risks in order to leave Falluja but it underlines how desperate their situation has become,"" she added. 'A human catastrophe' A hotline has been set up for the civilians in Falluja who want army assistance to leave - but air strikes continue, fighting is expected to intensify, and IS threatens to kill those who try to escape. The NRC says it believes that just one family has escaped from the city in the past nine days. ""A human catastrophe is unfolding in Fallujah. Families are caught in the crossfire with no safe way out,"" says NRC Secretary General Jan Egeland. Foreign humanitarian organisations are unable to enter Falluja. They are providing help to people from villages nearby, who manage to exit and reach refugee camps. Ms Abdulla said the families she has met speak of ""an extremely dire situation"". ""There are mainly two reasons for why people don't escape,"" she told the BBC World Service. ""One is because they are obviously extremely afraid. There are bombs and rockets and shootings right outside their doorstep so people have stopped even moving outside their houses. ""The other reason is, and this was a mother of three who told me this, when rumours got out that their family wanted to escape, IS came to their door, started beating up their men and started threatening the family's lives."" Faiq Ismali fled Falluja and is living in Barzinjah camp. He told the BBC that the people still there were ""being bombed randomly"". ""We are demanding that the government open a safe corridor for the families and protect them because they are between Daesh [IS] and the army,"" he said. Not another Ramadi Falluja has been under siege from Iraqi and pro-government forces for more than six months, and it has been under IS control for more than two years. The city is only partly-surrounded by Iraqi and allied forces. The BBC's Jim Muir, who is on the outskirts, says it seems the final all-out onslaught has yet to start, so fighting is expected to intensify. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is mobilising to distribute hygiene and shelter aid items to people who have fled the area recently. It warns that Falluja ""must not become another Ramadi"". Ramadi, 50km (20 miles) west of Falluja, was left in ruins after being occupied by IS fighters. The Iraqi military re-took the city in December 2015 but the city's infrastructure including roads, electricity, water supply and bridges has been badly damaged. Some civilians have started to return but they are at risk from unexploded bombs that have been left there.",Details are emerging of the horrifying conditions faced by civilians trapped inside the Iraqi city of Falluja and the extreme risks they are taking to escape.
"After six months of analysis, experts released a 200-page report detailing how the fragments were forged - likely made from old shoe leather. ""Each exhibits characteristics that suggest they are deliberate forgeries,"" the analysts said in a statement. The scrolls are a set of ancient manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible. The first of the scrolls were found in caves in Qumran on the western shore of the Dead Sea in 1947. They were reportedly first discovered by a young Bedouin shepherd searching for lost sheep. Their discovery is considered to be among the most significant archaeological finds in history. The majority are held in a collection by the Israeli government. The fakes were among the most valuable artefacts in the Museum of the Bible's collection. Costing $500m (£386m), the museum was opened by Evangelical Christian and billionaire Steve Green in 2017. Mr Green has not disclosed how much was paid for the 16 fragments but similar, authentic artefacts may be sold for millions. ""After an exhaustive review of all the imaging and scientific analysis results, it is evident that none of the textual fragments in Museum of the Bible's Dead Sea Scroll collection are authentic,"" said the head of the investigation, Colette Loll of Art Fraud Insights, in a statement. Since 2002, previously unknown textual fragments - believed to be biblical artefacts belonging to the Dead Sea Scroll - surfaced on the antiquities market. The Museum of the Bible purchased 16 of these fragments from four individual private collectors. Thirteen of these were published by a team of scholars in 2016 ""to provide a comprehensive physical and textual description of the fragments,"" the analysts wrote. ""At the time of publication, no scientific examination of the Museum's scroll fragments had been carried out."" ""Since publication, scholars have expressed growing concern about the authenticity of these fragments."" To make convincing fakes, researchers estimate the forgers coated the scraps with a ""shiny amber material... most likely animal skin glue"". The exhaustive report was the product of a six-month effort, including 3D microscopes, infrared spectroscopy and ""energy dispersive X-ray analysis"". Part of the same collection had already been removed from display after tests in October 2018 found them to be inauthentic too. These earlier tests were ordered after biblical scholars who examined 13 of the museum's previously unstudied fragments said there was a ""high probability"" that a number of them were modern forgeries. And this was not the first time the museum's owners have faced controversy. In 2017, Mr Green's company the Hobby Lobby paid a $3m fine (£2.3m) and returned thousands of items after the US Department of Justice accused it of smuggling artifacts from Iraq.",A collection of supposedly valuable Dead Sea Scroll fragments on display at the Museum of the Bible in Washington DC has been found to be fake.
"By Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check But while there are some signs of the pandemic slowing in India, some of its neighbours are seeing spikes in cases. Daily cases are rising in some countries India's population of 1.3 billion dwarfs that of its neighbours, so it's no surprise that its overall infection numbers are much higher. But the rate of growth in cases has slowed, and it had less than 30,000 new cases on 16 November for the first time in four months. In some other countries in South Asia, there seems to be a renewed increase in infections. In late October, Pakistan officially announced a second ""wave"" with a rise in daily cases and deaths. The authorities in Pakistan have imposed new restrictions making masks mandatory and restricting public gatherings. Nepal's cases peaked in October with the highest ever single day spike of nearly 6,000 cases on 22 October. But this dropped to 570 new cases on 27 October before another spike in early November. Bangladesh's daily cases peak around mid-June before they dropped in the last week of July and beginning of August. Daily cases are rising again with over 2,000 reported on 17 November. Afghanistan has also reported a rise in new cases this month, but there are questions about the reliability of its official figures. Sri Lanka is witnessing a spike in cases after two clusters were found in October in a garment factory and in a wholesale fish market. There've been other clusters detected within the police service and in prisons. And with cases continuing to rise, the mayor of the capital, Colombo, has called for a further lockdown just two weeks after restrictions were lifted. How much testing is done in South Asia? Testing is key to finding out how the virus is spreading. The Indian government ramped up testing, achieving one million tests in a single day since 21 August. But this has dropped during the Hindu festival of Diwali. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel points out that given the size of the population, testing numbers are still relatively low. The ""total numbers of cases per million people in India and the rest of South Asia are low, but so is the number of tests per million,"" he says. Bangladesh was testing over 18,000 a day in June when it witnessed a spike in cases, since then, daily testing has hovered at between ten and fifteen thousand. Bangladesh's testing numbers fell after the government introduced a high testing fee in July. There's also been a scandal around the sale of fake negative test certificates. Afghanistan has tested 128,643 samples as of 17 November, but the Red Crescent warned earlier this year that the actual number of cases could be much higher than officially announced. Pakistan has increased its testing since September, and its positivity rate rose to 6%, highest since July. But the level of testing in these countries is generally far lower than in other countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a benchmark range for adequate testing of between 10 and 30 per confirmed case in a country or region. South Asian countries have ramped up testing and India and Pakistan do now just fall within the range deemed adequate by the WHO. Sri Lanka ramped up its testing massively after the two clusters were reported in October. It's testing over 10,000 samples a day against 2,000 to 3,000 a day. But Bangladesh is identifying one positive case for every eight tests carried out - well below the WHO benchmark. What about the death rate in South Asia? The overall death toll in India is currently the third highest in the world, although the proportion of people who die after getting sick remains low compared to the global average. Deaths recorded elsewhere in South Asia are lower than in many other parts of the world, both in terms of absolute numbers and per capita figures. This appears to be an encouraging sign, but questions remain about the reliability of data in a region with relatively low levels of public health spending. ""Many deaths are not reported within the vital registration system and the causes of deaths are incorrectly classified,"" says Professor Kamran Siddiqi, a public health expert at the University of York. But even if deaths are under-reported, the difference from other areas of the world is noticeable. ""The most plausible explanation is that the populations in South Asia are made up of far younger people than say in Europe and the US,"" Prof Siddiqi says.

"The Ukrainian was jailed in Munich in 2011 as a war criminal but died during the appeal process in 2012, aged 91. Two photos, out of 361 from Sobibor and other camps, show Demjanjuk, a German Holocaust research centre says. About 1.7 million Jews were murdered at Sobibor and two other camps in 1941-43. Gas chambers were used at Sobibor, Treblinka and Belzec to kill Jews from ghettos in occupied Poland, in what Nazi Germany called ""Operation Reinhard"". Hardly any photos of Sobibor existed previously, so the find provides a wealth of new details about Nazi atrocities. The photos displayed by the Topography of Terror museum in Berlin belonged to former SS deputy commandant Johann Niemann, and were handed over by his grandson in 2015. Some photos show SS guards relaxing with alcohol and entertainment at Sobibor - not far from where Jews were being slaughtered. The photos chart Niemann's Nazi career, including places where disabled people were murdered, in the so-called T4 ""euthanasia"" programme, and the Sachsenhausen and Belzec camps. Niemann was killed by an axe-wielding Jewish inmate during a prisoner uprising in October 1943. The SS later destroyed Sobibor to wipe out evidence of their mass murder. The photo presentation comes just a day after international commemorations for the 1.1 million people - mostly Jews - murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz. Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp 75 years ago. Read more about the Holocaust: Demjanjuk was found guilty in 2011 of involvement in the murders of 28,000 Jews at Sobibor. He denied having served there, or having had any role in the Holocaust. He had spent decades working as a car mechanic in the US before being extradited - first to Israel, then to Germany. The SS trained auxiliaries from occupied Ukraine and other parts of the former Soviet Union to assist in the mass murder of Jews and other minorities. These helpers, recruited from among captured Soviet soldiers, were called ""Trawniki men"" by the Germans. An Israeli court sentenced Demjanjuk to death in 1988, but the verdict was overturned by Israel's Supreme Court in 1993 because of doubts about his identity. But investigators were not convinced by Demjanjuk's claims, and in 2009 he was extradited from the US to Germany, where he was found guilty and jailed. The sentencing of Demjanjuk broke new legal ground, as it allowed a conviction based on an individual's service in a death camp, without direct proof that they had committed an atrocity. The photo collection has been handed over to the archives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington. Niemann was a painter who began serving in Nazi concentration camps in the 1930s. 'Freedom to kill' German historian Martin Cüppers says the collection unveiled on Tuesday shows how lower-ranking SS were given significance as the Nazis developed the machinery of mass murder. ""Nazi perpetrators eager to seize the initiative, such as Niemann in Belzec, were invested with an astonishing freedom of action, which they used to develop and try out new methods of killing,"" Dr Cüppers said. One photo shows Niemann posing on a horse in early 1943 at the Sobibor ramp - the place where deported Jews arrived in cattle trucks. The Berlin researchers identify Niemann and two fellow Nazis - Karl Pötzinger and Siegfried Graetschus - posing outside a T4 killing centre in Brandenburg, west of Berlin, in 1940. Niemann had written ""Brandenburg"" on the back. All three were responsible for burning the bodies of murdered ""euthanasia"" victims, the researchers say. Part of Sobibor camp is seen in the photo below. Taken from a watchtower in early 1943, it shows woodpiles where slave labourers worked and, beyond that, SS accommodation and other buildings for the German guards.","Previously unseen photos from the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland have been unveiled, including two purported to show notorious guard John Demjanjuk."
"Ariel Castro, 52, is charged with kidnap and rape. He did not enter a plea. Bail was set at $8m (£5.1m), meaning in effect that he will remain in custody. The women were abducted at different times and held in Mr Castro's house. One of those held, Amanda Berry, 27, escaped on Monday and raised the alarm. The other women freed soon afterwards were Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32. 'Premeditated, depraved' Mr Castro, handcuffed and dressed in blue overalls, remained silent and looked down while lawyers spoke to the judge at Cleveland Municipal Court on Thursday. County prosecutor Brian Murphy told the court: ""The charges against Mr Castro are based on premeditated, deliberate, depraved decisions to snatch three young ladies from Cleveland West Side streets to be used in whatever self-gratifying, self-serving way he saw fit."" He is charged with four counts of kidnapping, covering the three initial abduction victims and Jocelyn, Ms Berry's six-year-old daughter, who was apparently conceived and born in captivity. The former school bus driver also faces three counts of rape, one against each woman. More charges may be added, officials have said. Two of Mr Castro's brothers, Pedro and Onil, were also arrested, but police found no evidence they were involved in the crime. They appeared in court alongside Ariel Castro on unrelated minor charges. Pedro Castro was fined $100 for public drinking, while two charges against Onil Castro were dropped. Death penalty possible Prosecutor Tim McGinty said on Thursday he would to seek aggravated murder charges against Mr Castro, and could even seek the death penalty against the former school bus driver. He told a news conference that murder charges would be based on evidence from one of the women held captive in Mr Castro's house that he had impregnated her, then physically abused and starved her in order to induce miscarriages. ""This child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of our city,"" Mr McGinity said. Ariel Castro has been put on suicide watch and will be kept in isolation, his court-appointed lawyer Kathleen DeMetz told reporters. The three women were all abducted after accepting rides from Mr Castro, according to a police report leaked to the media. On Thursday, Mr Castro's daughter, Arlene, who was one of the last people to see Gina DeJesus before she disappeared in 2004 aged 14, wept during a TV interview. Describing herself as ""disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated"", she apologised to Ms DeJesus. The women told officials they could only remember being outside twice during their time in captivity. Cleveland City Councilman Brian Cummins said the women had told police they had only gone as far as a garage on the property, disguised in wigs and hats. Mr Cummins, citing police information, said the victims had been kept apart inside the house until their captor felt he had enough control to allow them to mingle. A source told the BBC that one of the women was forced to help Ms Berry deliver her daughter, and was threatened with death if the child did not survive. Her baby was born in a plastic inflatable children's swimming pool on Christmas day 2006, according to a police report. Police said more than 200 pieces of evidence had been taken from the home where the three women were held captive. They said interviews with the women had yielded enough information to charge Mr Castro. Police said he had been co-operating with them, waiving his right to silence and agreeing to a test to establish Jocelyn's paternity. On Wednesday hundreds of cheering people welcomed home Ms DeJesus and Ms Berry and her daughter. Ms Berry, whose disappearance in 2003 the day before her 17th birthday was widely publicised in the local media, escaped on Monday evening by kicking the door and screaming for help, while her alleged captor was out. Ms Knight, who was 20 when she disappeared in 2002, remains in hospital. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports she had complained of chest pains during her rescue, but she is listed as in good condition.",The man accused of imprisoning three women for about a decade in the US city of Cleveland has made his first court appearance.

"In a video message posted on Twitter, he said the package ""really is a disgrace"", full of ""wasteful"" items. ""It's called the Covid relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,"" he said. The $900bn bill includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, but Mr Trump said the figure should be $2,000. His statement stunned Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating a coronavirus stimulus rescue package since July and Mr Trump - who has largely stayed out of the talks - had been expected to sign the legislation into law following its passage through Congress on Monday night. The package of measures is linked to a bigger government spending bill, which includes foreign aid funding as well as a $1.4tn spending measure to fund federal agencies for the next nine months. Those agencies will have to shut if the president vetoes or refuses to sign it by midnight next Monday. Most legislation that comes from Congress requires the approval of the president before becoming law. If the president rejects this bill, it would require at least a two-thirds majority in each chamber - the House of Representatives and the Senate - to override the veto. However, Mr Trump has not specifically said he would veto the bill. While Congress has overridden fewer than 10% of all presidential vetoes, US media say there could be enough votes from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to do so in this instance. What did Trump say? In Tuesday night's message from the White House, Mr Trump baulked at spending in the bill on other countries, arguing that this money should go to struggling Americans. He said: ""This bill contains $85.5m for assistance to Cambodia, $134m to Burma, $1.3bn for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment, $25m for democracy and gender programmes in Pakistan, $505m to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama."" The president questioned why the Kennedy Center, a performing arts complex in Washington DC, was set to receive $40m when it is not open, and more than $1bn has been allocated to museums and galleries in the capital. Mr Trump concluded: ""Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests, while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn't their fault. It was China's fault. ""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. ""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package."" What's in the aid bill? On Monday afternoon, congressional leaders unveiled a 5,593-page package and voted on it several hours later. Several lawmakers protested that they had not been given an opportunity to read the contents. Nevertheless the bill sailed through the House of Representatives by 359-53 and the Senate by 92-6. The relief package contains a number of provisions that will help tens of millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in the pandemic-battered economy. The one-off payments of $600 are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief. Monday's package extends federal jobless benefits of up to $300 per week for 11 weeks, although this again is half the amount provided by the previous bill. The package contains $25bn in rental aid and extends an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, a lifeline for millions of Americans. The bill also bans surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with often exorbitant stealth fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. But after poring over the mammoth legislation, journalists and critics have highlighted a string of alleged giveaways for lobbyists. The Washington Post, for example, reports that the package contains $110bn in tax breaks for sectors such as the liquor industry and motorsports entertainment. How have politicians reacted? On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph Biden said the coronavirus bill was merely a ""down payment"" and vowed he would press lawmakers to pass another stimulus bill after he enters office next month. ""Congress did its job this week,"" the Democrat said, speaking from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, ""and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year."" The most powerful congressional Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, usually a fierce antagonist of the president, said she agreed with Mr Trump's call for $2,000 one-off stimulus payments for every American. ""Let's do it!"" she tweeted, pledging that her party would bring the proposal to the floor this week. Such a plan would need to be passed by the Republican-controlled Senate, where it may well face resistance. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of President Trump, responded to Ms Pelosi with his own tweets welcoming her support for increasing payments, and saying ""let's go further"" and ""agree with President Trump that Big Tech needs to be reined in by winding down Section 230 liability protections"". The Democratic minority leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, tweeted: ""Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need"".",US President Trump has urged Congress to amend a $900bn (£670bn) coronavirus relief bill to more than triple its stimulus payments to Americans.
