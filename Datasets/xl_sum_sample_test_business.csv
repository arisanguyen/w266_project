"The rate increased from 27.7% in the previous month. For those under the age of 25, unemployment hit 61.4%. Harsh austerity measures have led the Greek economy to shrink by a quarter in four years. However, other economic indicators have suggested that there are signs of recovery. The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says the bleak unemployment numbers are in contrast to a message that the government has been trying to push: that Greece has turned a corner, with six years of recession due to end this year and light on the horizon. He says the contrast with pre-crisis Greece is stark. Before the country received its first 110bn-euro ($150bn; £90bn) bailout in May 2010, the jobless rate was under 12% here. Slight growth is expected this year and the deficit now wiped out, apart from interest payments on the bailout. But our correspondent says that the government fears it will take a big hit in local and European elections in May. Lagging indicator Greek unemployment is more than twice the average rate in the eurozone. The number of people out of work in the single currency bloc in December was 19 million, with the jobless rate at 12%, according to official EU figures. Other economic figures such as retail sales, manufacturing activity and construction, have pointed to signs that Greece's recession has bottomed out. However, Greece's unemployment rate is expected to rise further in the first three months of 2014 as firms continue to restructure and cut jobs. ""As expected, the labour market showed a lagging reaction to other positive signs in the economy, said economist Nikos Magginas at National Bank in Athens. ""The increase in unemployment is also due to a loss of support from tourism which was seen in the previous months."" With 1.38 million people officially jobless, turning around the country's economy will take time, even if the recovery does start this year as Athens hopes. Before the crash when Greece was growing at up to 5% annually, about 50,000 jobs a year were added to the economy. At these rates it could take more than 20 years to reduce the jobless totals - without measures to encourage domestic and foreign investment.","The jobless rate in Greece reached a record high of 28% in November, according to newly released government figures."
"It said that it now expects its pre-tax profits for the six months to April 2014 to be £85m, down from £115m in the same period this year. Analysts had been expecting pre-tax profits of £110m for that period. ""We did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the [Christmas sales] period,"" the retailer said. Debenhams was due to release its trading statement - covering the 17 weeks to 28 December - on 17 January, but updated the market early. 'Difficult environment' Shares in the department store chain closed down 12.2% on the last trading day of the year. Michael Sharp, the chief executive of Debenhams, said: ""As has been widely commented on in the media, the market was highly promotional in the run up to Christmas and we responded to these conditions to ensure our offer was competitive. ""However, this extremely difficult environment has inevitably had an impact on both our sales and profitability."" The firm said it had cut prices substantially in the run-up to Christmas and planned to offer higher markdowns in the January sales to move its stock. It said online sales grew by 27% for the 17-week period, but delivery income from the growth in online shopping was lower than anticipated. The company has been upgrading and modernising stores in recent years, as well as opening new ones. It has spent £25m on refurbishing its flagship store in central London. It plans to open a further 14 stores in the next four years.",Shares in Debenhams have plunged after the department store warned of poor sales during the key Christmas period.
"Restrictions on daily life have led to the closure of many companies and the laying off of staff - either permanently or temporarily. The International Labour Organization (ILO), an agency of the United Nations, has been looking at the global impact with a series of charts. Their work shows the global scale of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ""Workers and businesses are facing catastrophe, in both developed and developing economies,"" said ILO director general Guy Ryder. ""We have to move fast, decisively, and together. The right, urgent, measures, could make the difference between survival and collapse."" Nearly 200 million people could end up out of work The outbreak is expected to wipe out 6.7% of working hours across the world during the second quarter of 2020. That is the equivalent of 195 million full-time workers losing their jobs. The worst-hit region is predicted to be the Arab states, with an 8.1% decline in working hours (five million full-time workers). The ILO says it is ""the most severe crisis"" since World War Two. It adds that the eventual increase in global unemployment during the course of 2020 will depend largely on two factors: There is a high risk that the end-of-year worldwide unemployment figure will be much higher than an initial ILO projection of 25 million people. Accommodation services and manufacturing badly hit Different sectors of the economy have been hit in different ways by the sudden downturn in work. Not surprisingly, with travel at a minimum and social lives put on hold, the accommodation and food services industries are among those suffering most, along with manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and real estate and business. Together, they account for nearly 38% of the global workforce, with 1.25 billion people employed in these industries around the world. Americas and Europe have most high-risk workers The percentage of people around the world in high-risk jobs varies considerably. A total of 43.2% of people in the Americas and 42.1% in Europe and Central Asia work in high-risk sectors. These regions have far fewer informal workers, who make up the majority of the workforce in Africa, the Arab states and Asia and the Pacific. While these workers play a crucial role in the economy, especially in countries like India, Nigeria and Brazil, they miss out on things like social protection, that other permanent workers have. Mr Ryder said: ""This is the greatest test for international co-operation in more than 75 years. If one country fails, then we all fail, We must find solutions that help all segments of our global society, particularly those that are most vulnerable or least able to help themselves.""",A total of 81% of the global workforce of 3.3 billion people have had their workplace fully or partly closed.
"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News ""It was on the plane over I realised I'd made a mistake,"" a 25-year-old private tutor tells me. He was flying to New York to spend the summer helping to prepare a 12-year-old boy for the Common Entrance exam - a test taken by children applying to private secondary schools. The boy's mother had insisted he sat next to the boy so he could spend the flight time teaching him. He did an hour and then given they were spending the next three weeks together, decided to take a nap. The next thing he knew, he was being woken up by the mother standing over him, shouting ""You think this is some kind of holiday?"". Given the high fees charged by such tutors and the intense competition for places at top British schools it's perhaps not surprising that tensions can sometimes run high. ""In an already privileged world, tutoring is an extra level of pushing,"" he says. The Londoner uses the job's flexibility to fund his real passion of film production and acting. He is unwilling to be named in this article in case it jeopardises future jobs. Yet he says the money easily makes up for the occasional difficulties. He charges anywhere from £40 to £90 an hour in the UK, although the agencies he is hired through take a 25% to 50% cut of this. When he takes an overseas job, the fees are much higher to compensate for the fact that he can't do any other work. Typically he earns between £800 and £1,500 a week. In three years as a tutor he's worked in India, Indonesia and Costa Rica, as well as the US. Hiring an English tutor is increasingly common in many countries, particularly for those who want their children to go to an overseas private secondary school, he says. The fact that he ""sounds a bit posh"" and went to a top London school are ""valuable trading cards"" in an international industry which is ""a lot about image as well as actual background,"" he says. This kind of tutoring is one of the British education services that makes a valuable contribution to the UK economy. Collectively, education exports were worth a whopping £17.5bn in 2011, the most recent figure available. This includes education products and services, income from international students in higher education as well as schools and English language lessons. Those working in the industry suggest the value is likely to have grown since then. Mark Maclaine, who co-founded the agency, Tutorfair, in 2012 after over a decade of tutoring, says overseas demand is enormous and growing. His overseas customers are mostly from Asia, the Middle East, eastern Europe and Russia. Dubbed ""a super tutor"" due to his students' success rate, he charges fees on a sliding scale, anywhere from £150 an hour up to a staggering £1,000. At the upper end of the scale, he says it's typically consultancy. A short time to teach someone how to study and prepare for an exam independently as opposed to a continuing arrangement. Toxic environment Word of mouth recommendations have seen him hired by US actors and actresses and he's taught in a variety of exotic locations from a yacht sailing around the Caribbean to private islands in luxury holiday resorts. He admits that the high pressure can create a toxic environment, and says experience has taught him to interview a family before he commits to a job. We're speaking over the phone while he's in Bali, where he has tagged a holiday onto the end of a tutoring job. ""The British private education system is seen as one of the best in the world. Royal families, rulers of countries are very very keen that their kids get some form of education in Britain,"" he says. The demand is high enough that two to three times a year Mr Maclaine will get an ""emergency call"" from a family desperate for his immediate services. Normally these calls come when a child has failed a practice exam for a UK school and ""everyone panics"". Often he'll offer to tutor by Skype, but occasionally when he's offered a ""stupid amount of money"" he'll agree to fly out. ""I'm a human being. I've got a mortgage to pay"". To help address the balance, Tutorfair says that for every child whose parents pay for its service it gives tutoring to another boy or girl whose mother and father, or other guardian, cannot afford to pay. It's not just tutoring agencies cashing in on the foreign demand for a British education. Many private schools have opened branches overseas: Harrow has schools in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Bangkok; while Dulwich College and Wellington College both have overseas franchises in China. Such extensions create a handy extra revenue stream for private schools as the domestic market slows. But Charles Bonas, founder of Bonas MacFarlane, which offers tuition and also advises on choices of schools from nursery to university, says many families still prefer to send their children to school in the UK. He says partly it's because it's a way for wealthy families with drivers and nannies to help their offspring become more independent. But he says the main reasons that parents choose the UK is because English is spoken as a first language, and the education is deemed well-rounded - teaching children how to think critically and take risks.

Often parents only want the top name schools, he says recalling the time two years ago when the parents of a five-year-old girl said they wanted her to go to Eton next term. ""They didn't take no as an immediate answer,"" he says. But this is where the firm uses its consultation skills, a process costing from £3,000 to £12,000 with a relationship that can last years. ""I took on a parent last year whose children weren't even born yet. They're going to need a nursery, pre-prep, prep and a senior school,"" he explains. Whether or not these arrangements are simply perpetuating inequality, Mr Bonas argues that they are of long-term benefit to the UK, and not just because of the economic boost. ""These children have often got a family business to take over and will be the movers and shakers in their world. ""If they have an affinity for Britain then that can only be a good thing,"" he says.","Education services bring in £17.5bn a year to the UK economy, but what is driving the demand for a British education and why are some parents willing to spend thousands of pounds to secure a ""super tutor"" for their child?"
"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter It will force thousands of contractors and freelancers to pay income tax, as well as National Insurance (NI) at the 12% rate, rather than a lower rate. But many say the new rules will make firms too scared to employ them. They reckon the rules will not just hit their job prospects, but their finances and the flexibility of their chosen careers will suffer too. Melissa Holloway, a freelance medical copywriter and healthcare industry consultant, told the BBC: ""It's not about trying to cut down on tax. It's about making more room to give back to the community and for your family."" Confusing and woolly rules Melissa has been freelance for four years and says she prefers it, as it allows her to spend more time volunteering in her community and running a small charity, as well as devoting more time to her three-year-old. She added: ""My husband and I eat dinner with our son most evenings, which wouldn't be possible if I were working late and and travelling as much as I did as an employee."" She warned that the new rules are ""confusing and woolly"" after discovering that two of her recent jobs would be regarded differently under HMRC's Check Employment Status for Tax: ""It said one was outside the intermediaries' legislation and one was inside,"" she reported. Freelancer Iona Bain, founder of Young Money Blog & Agency said the proposed changes ""scare me enormously"". She said: ""Those who benefit from fooling HMRC over their employment status are businesses trying to avoid National Insurance, not the majority of freelancers trying to make ends meet. ""But these rules mean many self-employed workers will be wrongly re-employed on higher taxes without any of the benefits that full-time employees enjoy."" She said she has experienced many instances of employers wrongly classifying her for tax and pension purposes, costing her time and money. ""That will be nothing compared to the confusion and complexity caused by these rule changes."" Massive skill shortage IT contractor Eddy Henry has calculated the new rules will cost him £1,162 a month. But he predicted that companies will panic and to avoid problems, will put all their contractors on IR35. ""The immediate hit will be massive, as every contractor I know will leave,"" he said. There is already a massive skill shortage in the UK IT industry and if he's right, IR35 will make things worse. That fear is echoed by IT recruiter Leigh Carrick-Moore, founder of e-Search Consulting. She warned: ""Extending IR35 to the private sector is prohibitive to the encouragement of a flexible and highly-skilled workforce in the UK. She predicted it could lead to the contract market drying up and move to other tech hubs, such as Amsterdam or Berlin. Eddy Henry said politicians had to learn to understand how things worked in the IT sector. ""Whoever is pushing this does not understand contractors, the value we add or the risks we take in employment."" Iona Bain holds a similar view. ""Politicians don't know what it's like to be self-employed. They don't know what it's like to chase up invoices, wonder if they'll get paid this month or worry about having to make their own pension provisions,"" she said. ""If they lived in our shoes for just a month or two, maybe they would get that IR35 is not just a financial but a psychological shadow, hanging over all of us."" How will the new rules work? For IR35 to apply, you have to work through your own company for another business. If the way you work is similar to an employee of that business, you should pay income tax, and National Insurance at the 12% rate. Up to now, many contractors in personal service companies have been paying less tax and NI. But from April 2020, larger businesses - such as banks - will take on responsibility for deciding which contractors will need to pay more tax and NI. The rule change will not apply to the smallest 1.5 million businesses.",Many self-employed people face a higher tax bill from 2020 when the IR35 rule is extended to the private sector.
"The models include the Corolla and the Yaris subcompact models, most of them sold in Japan, China and Europe. The cars affected were produced between May 2000 and November 2001, and between April 2006 and December 2014. Global carmaker have for years been hampered by recalls of airbags made by Takata. Toyota said it was calling back 1.47 million airbags in cars sold in Europe, 1.16 million in Japan, 820,000 in China, and 2.35 million in other regions excluding the US. Toyota's recall on Wednesday brings its total of recalled Takata airbags to 23.1 million. So far, a total of 12 carmakers have had to recall vehicles because of faulty Takata airbags, with the total number of recalls expected to exceed 100 million cars. Car parts maker Takata is already facing huge compensation costs over its airbags, which are used by many car manufacturers and have been linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. US regulators believe the volatile chemical used in the inflators, ammonium nitrate, can cause airbags to explode with excessive force. Several automakers, including Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Ford have said they will stop using Takata airbags containing ammonium nitrate in future models. Takata also produces seatbelts, child seats, and other safety-related car parts.","The world's biggest carmaker, Toyota, is recalling another 5.8 million cars worldwide over potentially faulty air bags made by supplier Takata."
"By Darin GrahamMoney Box reporter Claudia only discovered the CCJ against her when she got her first job. ""If it hadn't been for my job I would never have known,"" says the 23-year-old. The number of people in their 20s with court orders for unpaid debt has risen sharply in the last year, according to figures seen by Radio 4's Money Box. Court records from the Registry Trust show that last year 160,000 were given CCJs, up 30% from the year before. Why the increase? Zero hour contracts, payday loans, unstable jobs, mobile phone bills, subscription services and increasing rent prices are thought to be partly behind the rise, the Registry Trust says. Claudia's CCJ was for £270, for two weeks' outstanding rent when she was in student accommodation at university. ""I [had] moved out from my family home into a different home, so I never received any correspondence from the court,"" she said. ""The CCJ was filed in April 2017. I found out about it in July 2018 with my first job. It came about again with my second job in 2019. ""I didn't understand the severity until I got my latest job. It was insinuated that 'it needs to come off [be paid off]' or else I could lose my job,"" she said. Claudia disputes the £270 her ex-landlord says she owed him, and said she had faced problems applying for credit because of her CCJ. So she sought legal advice to challenge it and it's now been resolved, an outcome she's happy with. ""I tried to change my phone contract from my parents' name to my name. That didn't work. My car broke and I tried to finance a new car in my name. That didn't work."" Most judgements in the last year for Claudia's age group were for amounts between £100 and £500. The second largest proportion was for amounts between £500 and £1,000. What is a CCJ? A CCJ is a court order in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that can be issued to an individual if they fail to repay money they owe. It's an action creditors can take as part of the debt collection process. If the debt is not paid, the CCJ can be filed on an individual's credit report and remain on it for six years. That can lead to problems getting things like a mortgage, credit card, a lease on a rental property and a mobile phone contract. The file can be removed from a credit report if the debt is paid within one month of receiving the judgement. If it's settled later, it remains on an individual's credit report with a note marking that it's been paid. In Scotland, county court judgements are called decrees. Like CCJs, they can remain on a credit file for six years. The Registry Trust, a not-for-profit group which manages court records on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, said the rise in CCJs for low amounts can be explained by banks and phone companies selling off smaller debts to specialist debt collection agencies. ""We've seen a massive rise in the number of judgements but a fall in the average value of judgements, which means that more and more creditors are using the courts to recover smaller debts,"" said Mick McAteer, chairman of the Registry Trust. He said that for some people, they only find out there is a CCJ on their credit record when they apply for a loan. ""Younger people tend to move house more often than their older counterparts, so they might miss letters about CCJs,"" he said. ""However, the purpose of a CCJ is to get someone to pay the money they owe."" Sir Bob Neill, chairman of the House of Commons Justice Committee, said the rise is ""very troubling and it's part of an underlying problem of a lack of financial education that we have"". He added that the next stage after a CCJ is when bailiffs are used to enforce a payment. But by then, he added, ""a lot of the harm of the CCJ has already been done to people's credit rating"". The Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for the Courts and Tribunals service which issues CCJs, said it ""doesn't routinely comment on rises in statistics"".

"By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy He was greeted like a rock star in Boston, Massachusetts, but the great novelist was a man with a cause: he wanted to put an end to cheap, sloppy pirated copies of his work in the US. They circulated with impunity because the United States granted no copyright protection to non-citizens. In a bitter letter to a friend, Dickens compared the situation to being mugged and then paraded through the streets in ridiculous clothes. ""Is it tolerable that besides being robbed and rifled,"" he wrote, ""an author should be forced to appear in any form - in any vulgar dress - in any atrocious company?"" Monopoly It was a powerful and melodramatic metaphor. But the truth is the case for what Dickens was demanding - legal protection for ideas that otherwise could be freely copied and adapted - has never been quite so clear cut. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Patents and copyright grant a monopoly. Dickens's British publishers will have charged as much as they could get away with for copies of Bleak House. Cash-strapped literature lovers simply had to go without. But these potential fat profits encourage new ideas. It took Dickens a long time to write Bleak House. If other British publishers could have ripped it off like the Americans, perhaps he wouldn't have bothered. So, intellectual property reflects an economic trade-off, a balancing act. If it's too generous to the creators, then good ideas will take too long to copy, adapt and spread. If it's too stingy, then maybe we won't see the good ideas at all. This trade-off has always been coloured by politics. The British legal system strongly protected the rights of British authors and British inventors in the 1800s because the UK was then - as now - a powerful force in world culture and innovation. Brazen copying But in Dickens's day, American literature and innovation were in their infancy. The US economy was in full-blown copying mode: they wanted the cheapest possible access to the best ideas that Europe could offer. US newspapers filled their pages with brazen copying - alongside attacks on the interfering Mr Dickens. A few decades later, when American authors and inventors spoke with a more powerful voice, America's lawmakers began to take an increasingly fond view of the idea of intellectual property. Newspapers, once opposed to copyright, now rely upon it. And we can expect to see a similar transition in developing countries today: the less they copy other ideas and the more they create their own, the more they protect ideas. There's been a lot of recent movement: China didn't have a copyright system at all until 1991. The modern form of intellectual property originated, like so many things, in 15th Century Venice. Venetian patents were explicitly designed to encourage innovation. The inventor would automatically receive a patent if their invention was useful. The patent was temporary, but could be sold, transferred or even inherited during its lifetime. It would be forfeited if it wasn't used, and invalidated if the invention proved to be closely based on a previous idea. These are all very modern ideas. And they soon created very modern problems. Rivalry During the British industrial revolution, the great engineer James Watt worked out a superior way to design a steam engine. He spent months developing a prototype, but then put even more effort into securing a patent. His influential business partner, Matthew Boulton, even got the patent extended by lobbying Parliament. Boulton and Watt used it to extract licensing fees and crush rivals - for example, Jonathan Hornblower, who made an even better steam engine yet found himself ruined and imprisoned. The details may have been grubby, but surely Watt's famous invention was worth it? Well, maybe not. The economists Michele Boldrin and David Levine argue that what truly unleashed steam-powered industry was the expiry of the patent, in 1800, as rival inventors revealed the ideas they had been sitting on for years. And what happened to Boulton and Watt, once they could no longer sue those rivals? They flourished anyway. They redirected their attention from litigation towards the challenge of producing the best steam engines in the world. They kept their prices as high as ever, and their order books swelled. Far from incentivising improvements in the steam engine, the patent actually delayed them. Expansion Yet since the days of Boulton and Watt, intellectual property protection has grown more expansive, not less so. Copyright terms are growing ever longer. In the US, they were originally 14 years, renewable once. They now last 70 years after the death of the author - typically more than a century. Patents have become broader and are being granted on vague ideas - for example, Amazon's ""one-click"" US patent protects the not-entirely-radical idea of buying a product on the internet by clicking only one button. The US intellectual property system now has a global reach, thanks to the inclusion of intellectual property rules in what tend to be described as ""trade agreements"". And more and more things fall under the scope of intellectual property - for example plants, buildings and software have all been brought into its domain. More from Tim Harford What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? TV Dinner: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution Geeks v government: The battle over public key cryptography How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform These expansions are hard to justify, but easy to explain: intellectual property is very valuable to its owners, which justifies the cost of employing expensive lawyers and lobbyists. Meanwhile, the cost of the restrictions are spread widely among people who barely notice it. The likes of Matthew Boulton and Charles Dickens have a strong incentive to lobby aggressively for more draconian intellectual property laws - while the many buyers of steam engines and Bleak House are unlikely to get politically organised to object. The economists Boldrin and Levine have a radical response to this problem: scrap intellectual property altogether. There are, after all, other rewards for inventing things - getting a ""first mover"" advantage over your competitors, establishing a strong brand, or enjoying a deeper understanding of what makes a product work. Financial upside? In 2014, the electric car company Tesla opened up access to its patent archive in an effort to expand the industry as a whole, calculating the company would benefit overall. For most economists, scrapping intellectual property entirely is going too far. They point to important cases - such as new medicines - where the costs of invention are enormous and the costs of copying are trivial. But those who defend intellectual property protections still tend to argue that - right now - those protections offer more than enough incentive to create new ideas. Dickens himself eventually discovered a financial upside to weak copyright protection. Twenty five years after his initial visit to the US, Dickens returned, keen to make some money. He reckoned that so many people had read cheap knock-offs of his stories that he could cash in on his fame with a lecture tour. He was absolutely right: off the back of pirated copies of his work, Charles Dickens made a fortune as a public speaker, many millions of dollars in today's terms. Perhaps the intellectual property was worth more when given away.

"The voluntary wage - set by the Living Wage Foundation - is now 21% higher than the compulsory National Minimum Wage, which is currently £6.50 an hour. The rate in London will rise from £8.80 an hour to £9.15, the mayor, Boris Johnson, announced. However, some business groups said employers might struggle to pay it. The living wage has been adopted by more than 1,000 employers across the country, benefiting 35,000 workers. Firms who have signed up to the voluntary scheme include Barclays, Standard Life, the National Portrait Gallery, as well as many local councils and charities. On Sunday, Citizens UK, the community organisation behind the Living Wage project, said the number of companies paying the rate had more than doubled in the past year. 'Struggle' Despite this rise, research published on Monday by accounting firm KPMG - a supporter of the wage - found 22% of the working population earn less than the 2013 Living Wage - which was set at £7.65 an hour. It said more than five million people were paid below that rate, and that women were more likely to earn less than men. Among them is John from Manchester, who earns £7.10 an hour - above the minimum wage, but less than the living wage. He is employed by a well-known High Street retailer, but he and his colleagues cannot afford to buy anything from the shop where they work. ""If your salary from the store is your only source of income it is a struggle to shop at the full prices in any of the sections,"" he told the BBC. ""If two young people working in the retail industry tried to get a mortgage they would be laughed out of the bank,"" he added. 'Dilemma' However, some business groups are not happy with the increase in the living wage. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said some employers might struggle to pay it. It also said that it would rather concentrate on keeping people in work, even if it meant lower wages. ""For businesses operating in a particularly competitive environment, they face a difficult dilemma - employing five people on the minimum wage, or just four on the living wage,"" said Simon Walker, director general of the IoD. ""This isn't a decision any business leader takes lightly, and we need to avoid stigmatising those employers who cannot afford the living wage,"" he added. The Federation of Small Businesses said it supported the living wage, but that it should remain a voluntary goal. What is the difference between the living wage and the national minimum wage? The living wage is an informal benchmark, not a legally enforceable minimum level of pay, like the national minimum wage. The national minimum wage is set by the business secretary each year on the advice of the Low Pay Commission. It is enforced by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The living wage is currently calculated by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, while the London living wage has been calculated by the Greater London Authority since 2005. The basic idea is that these are the minimum pay rates needed to let workers lead a decent life. Read more on the Living Wage. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said low pay was a strain on the public purse, as ""firms that pay the minimum wage are seeing their workers' pay topped up through the benefits system"". He added that ""rewarding a hard day's work with a fair day's pay"" was the driving principle behind the Living Wage.","The UK ""living wage"" - an hourly rate based on the amount needed to cover the basic costs of living - has been raised by 20p to £7.85."
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said sales volumes in October were up 7.4% from a year earlier. On a monthly basis, sales jumped 1.9% from September - a much stronger increase than economists had forecast. October's autumnal conditions boosted clothing sales. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Clothing sales in particular were strong, perhaps reflecting the cooler weather prompting a re-stocking of consumers' winter wardrobes."" The ONS also said that internet sales posted the strongest growth for five years, jumping almost 27%. ""Non-store sales have surged over the last months, rising by 4.1% in September and 3.6% in October, showing no weakening in the trend away from spending on the high street to online shopping,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The figures suggest consumer confidence remains robust in the face of uncertainty caused by Brexit. The pound jumped 0.3% to $1.2478 following the data, but fell against the euro. Stronger sales were helped by falling prices. Average store prices fell by 0.7% in October 2016 compared with October 2015 and there were falls in average store price across all store types, except petrol stations, the ONS said. However, analysts said that the era of falling prices was set to end soon at a time of weak wage growth. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, commented: ""UK retailers enjoyed a mini-boom in October. But such spending is looking increasingly unsustainable as inflation is likely to rear its head in coming months and households are growing worried about their future finances."" Mr Tombs said retail sales growth was likely to disappoint in November as clothing sales returned to normal levels.","UK retail sales rose at their fastest annual rate in 14 years in October, bolstered by colder weather and Halloween sales at supermarkets."
"The construction firm owes £900m to RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander. The banks may be able to show Carillion more leniency if the government is able to do its part, according to sources. The firm's future is also being discussed by government officials. Carillion is involved in major public projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. How exactly the banks want the government to intervene is unclear. They could want the government to offer some guarantees in case Carillion cannot pay back its debts. Or they may want the government to take some of Carillion's key projects back into the public sector. The TUC has called on the government to ""step in"" to ""guarantee jobs and services"". Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: ""Tens of thousands of jobs are now at risk, along with vital public services and major infrastructure projects across the country."" New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC the government was keeping ""a very close eye on this"". Mr Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government was ""making sure all plans and contingency plans are in place"". But he refused to be drawn on whether the government would bail Carillion out. ""It's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say I would hope to see that the working capital that they need will be there working with their partners,"" he said. Labour peer Lord Adonis, who last month quit a head of the National Infrastructure Commisson, tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company had issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed. Analysis: Joe Lynam, business correspondent Carillion's banks are owed about £900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans. The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has urged the government not to agree to a taxpayer-funded bailout for Carillion. Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. Share price plummeted Carillion has debts of £1.5bn, including a £587m pension shortfall. The UK's second-largest construction company employs 43,000 people worldwide, with about 20,000 of them in the UK. It specialises in construction, as well as facilities management and ongoing maintenance. As recently as 2016 it had sales of £5.2bn and until July 2017 its market capitalisation was close to £1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just £61m. Its problems stem in part from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. It has worked on high-profile projects, including the Battersea Power station redevelopment and the Anfield Stadium expansion. It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages roads and prisons. The concern is that if it were to collapse these key public sector services could suffer a lot of disruption.","The troubled government contractor Carillion has held talks with its creditor banks this weekend and further meetings are planned for Monday, the BBC understands."
"The warning came in a letter to Environment Secretary Michael Gove from more than 30 business leaders. They said it looked ""ever more the likeliest outcome"" that the UK would leave the EU without an agreement. The government said leaving the EU with a deal remained its ""top priority"". ""We are meeting weekly with representatives from our food and drink industry to help prepare for all scenarios,"" said a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But the food industry said the current situation was a ""moment of potential crisis"" for their industry. Those signing the letter included the heads of the Food and Drink Federation, the National Farmers' Union and UK Hospitality. Members of the various trade bodies include Mondelez subsidiary Cadbury; KP Snacks, which makes Hula Hoops; and Butterkist popcorn, as well as consumer goods giant Nestle. ""Neither we nor our members have the physical resources nor organisational bandwidth to engage with and properly respond to non-Brexit related policy consultations or initiatives at this time,"" they wrote. ""Government has recruited many extra staff; we cannot."" The firms urge the government to place a range of current and planned industry consultations on ""pause"" until the Brexit uncertainty is over. The consultations the firms cite include one relating to further curbs on the advertising of sugary foods, a national recycling collection strategy and proposals for a tax on plastic items with less than 30% recycled content. The letter, first reported by Sky, is further evidence of the industry's frustration at the continuing lack of certainty over the Brexit process. ""Businesses throughout the UK food chain - and their trade associations - are now totally focused on working to mitigate the catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit,"" says the letter, which was sent last Friday. ""Large amounts of time, money, people and effort are being diverted to that end."" The letter comes just two weeks after major retailers warned MPs that a no-deal Brexit would cause huge disruption to the industry, leading to higher prices and empty shelves in the short-term. Sainsbury's, Asda and McDonald's were among those who warned stockpiling fresh food was impossible, and that the UK was very reliant on the EU for produce.","The UK food industry has threatened to stop co-operating with government policy consultations, saying it is busy trying to stave off the ""catastrophic impact"" of a no-deal Brexit."
"By Sean FarringtonBusiness reporter, BBC 5 Live And it seems there's been a surprising impact on the toughest business of them all - love. Use of online dating site eHarmony spiked by 35% in the US in the days that followed the Republican's victory. Businesses don't like uncertainty, goes the mantra. Well, nor, it seems, do those looking for love. Grant Langston, chief executive of eHarmony, told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the increase in activity on his site was reminiscent of those seen after the 9/11 attacks. ""You see a spike in usage after Donald Trump and people's desires to be in a relationship, so if they're in a bad relationship they don't want to leave, and if they're not in one, they want to get into one. ""November is usually a pretty low season, and we saw a tremendous spike in usage after the November 8 election. When 9/11 happened we saw a similar change in people. When times get unpredictable, they just want to be with someone."" Tinder effect It's not only a changing political climate that is keeping eHarmony and its customers on their toes. Since the company was founded 17 years ago in California, the dating site now has many more competitors, with one in particular changing the landscape. ""Tinder has made 20-somethings want to participate in online dating. Prior to that, it wasn't something that interested people in their 20s, they thought online dating was sad,"" says Mr Langston. But he also sees Tinder's emergence as an opportunity for his business, which asks people to fill in long questionnaires in the hope of finding a long-term match. ""People in that age group come into the market, then we catch people who aren't satisfied with the Tinder experience or are more interested in a more meaningful relationship."" Although he hasn't followed the ""swipe left"" style of Tinder, eHarmony has had to adapt as a result. ""The mechanism of delivering that service has got to change, and we've changed it a lot. The communication process, where you swap messages, was quite antiquated, and we've made it much more like text, immediate and very easy."" While Donald Trump may have got those looking for love logging in, has that other first-date conversational taboo - Brexit - had much of an impact on eHarmony and its choice of European headquarters? ""For now we're ok with [our London office],"" Mr Lagston says, though he adds, ""there is always a chance we could move it to Frankfurt or some such place.""","From the moment Donald Trump's election victory was confirmed on 9 November, all sorts of businesses have had to keep alert to the fallout of a result they didn't expect."
"Pre-tax profit for the 26 weeks to 27 August was £1.9bn, up 12.1% on a year earlier. Group sales rose 8.8% to £35.5bn, but like-for-like UK sales excluding VAT and petrol fell 0.5%. The company highlighted ""excellent growth"" in Europe and Asia but also ""subdued demand"" in the UK. Rival Sainsbury's reported slightly better like-for-like sales. Excluding petrol but not VAT, Sainsbury's sales rose by 1.9% for the first six months of the financial year. The equivalent figure at Tesco was a rise of 0.5%. Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King said: ""We have delivered a good sales performance in a tough consumer environment."" Despite Sainsbury's stronger sales, analysts said Tesco was in a better position to outperform long term. ""Sainsbury's may have pipped Tesco at the post in terms of growing UK sales, but for overall prospects Tesco remains the darling of the sector,"" said Richard Hunter at Hargreaves Lansdown. 'Weak' sales Tesco contrasted the ""challenging conditions"" in developed countries, particularly the UK and the Irish Republic, with ""continued strong growth in emerging economies"". The company said ""weak"" sales in the UK were not helped by slowing demand for non-food items, particularly in electronics and entertainment, two of its largest product groups. It also highlighted the high price of petrol and its impact on general consumer spending. Despite the fall in like-for-like sales, trading profits in the UK rose by 4.5% to £1.3bn. Tesco makes about two-thirds of its sales and profits in the UK. In an interview with Reuters news agency, the head of the British Retail Consortium, Stephen Robertson, said retailers were ""finding life extremely difficult"". He said underlying costs were increasing and margins were being squeezed. ""I think we've probably got another 18 months of real challenge,"" he said. Outside the UK, Tesco has seen an improvement in sales. In the US, like-for-like sales excluding petrol grew by almost 12%. The company said its plan to break even in the country in the 2012-13 financial year was ""showing promising early results"". Like-for-like sales in Europe grew by 1% and in Asia by 3.8%. Price cuts Tesco has been reducing prices on about 3,000 items in the UK in an attempt to attract new customers, but analysts said that it was recovering this money elsewhere. Having increased the number of points rewarded for every pound spent on its loyalty card scheme, the company was now reducing it again, Rahul Sharma at Neve Capital told the BBC. ""As part if its new price campaign, they're cutting the discount [from loyalty cards] from about 2% to 1%,"" he said. ""They are cutting prices by £500m, which roughly works out at 1%-1.5%, but then they're taking this back [by cutting the points available through loyalty cards]."" Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke told the BBC that reducing the number of points given out on loyalty cards had given the company an extra £350m to help reduce prices.",Supermarket group Tesco has reported a rise in half-year profits despite a fall in underlying sales in the UK.
"By Howard MustoeBusiness reporter Anglo American will buy the mine for £404m, or 5.5p per share. But since the shares were being bought for 24p each only nine months ago, some small investors are nursing big losses, including those who put entire pensions behind the firm. ""You feel extremely sorry for people who've invested a lot of money,"" says Mark Lightowler, a retiree who invested in Sirius. He will lose two thirds of his investment, ""but because it was high risk it wasn't very big, it was only a couple of thousand pounds."" He says he will back the deal. It promises to be a good employer in a ""difficult area of the country to get work"". No checks? Sirius says that if shareholders don't accept the offer, there is a good chance the company will go into administration - potentially wiping out their investments. The firm says £4bn Woodsmith project, its biggest, could potentially create 4,000 jobs in a region with the highest unemployment rate in England and Wales. It mines polyhalite, a mineral used in fertilising crops, from underneath the North York Moors National Park. The company has 85,000 individual shareholders. About 10,000 of these are located in areas surrounding the Teesside project, where people may have invested for the regenerative benefits for the North East. Mr Lightowler said that while free access to stock markets is ""utterly fantastic"", he feels that it should be harder for people to put large chunks of their money in very risky investments. like mining stocks. ""It has to have a set of checks and balances and controls and it seems entirely lacking."" 'Successful project' Rupert Clewley, a financial consultant in Kent, invested in the company alongside about 30-40 others. He invested about £5,000 and will lose about three quarters of it, he said. But the trick is to pick more winners than losers, he added, and has been stock-watching for 20 years. ""I thought it was quite risky but I'd put some money towards it,"" he said. ""It's one of those things. It was speculative. It was one of those where you would get nothing, a little bit back, or five or ten times your investment."" The situation is ""a bit unfortunate as I do think they will be a successful project in a long term,"" he said. Anglo American boss Mark Cutifani agrees. ""We look everywhere for projects and we were pleasantly surprised to find something in Yorkshire,"" Mr Cutifani told the Today programme on Radio 4. He thinks it's got long-term prospects, if only for the most basic of reasons. ""In the future people will continue to eat,"" he said. ""We will need to see more productivity from the agricultural sector and the fertiliser they produce does help the productivity of agriculture.""

"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter The government itself would not wildly disagree with the Labour leader's general suggestion. There is, however, a question about the extent of that change and the speed with which the brakes are applied to record government borrowing, as the economy is reopened. The totemic Labour policy announced today proposes accessing the excess of household public savings during the pandemic, calculated by the Bank of England at £125bn, in order to help fund the recovery. Savers would get an attractive and secure interest rate from this British Recovery Bond - and the government a decent slice of long-term funding to redirect to small business loans and infrastructure, for example. The majority of those savings are currently expected to sit in bank accounts earning low or no interest. Sir Keir is trying to make the public finances a participation sport. The need to pay extra taxes at some point shows that is already the case. This a gentle lean into a more global argument where high levels of public borrowing will be tolerated to secure the recovery from an historical economic hit. Most clearly this is being seen in the new US administration ""going big"" on a spending and borrowing stimulus, including $2,000 cheques for families. The government would say it already went ""big"" in terms of the Covid-19 rescue and plans to do so on investment spending as part of its ""levelling up"" agenda. But as Chancellor Rishi Sunak told me last week, he wants to be ""honest"" with the public about bringing the public finances down from record levels at the Budget. The Treasury points to the fact that the UK's borrowing is near the top of the league of comparable countries and it does not have the same status to print dollars as the United States. It also calculates that the public knows that a bill is coming for a year of Covid rescues. The opposition now says that needs to be put off to the ""medium-long term"", including tax rises on business. Even though Sir Keir won't get to enact his plans right now, they could affect the ongoing balancing act between a Number 10 with low tax and high infrastructure-spending instincts, and a Number 11 trying to find a quicker path out of record amounts of red ink. It is a tension that will underpin every coming decision over the timing of tax rises and the rollback of coronavirus support measures, from the furlough scheme to universal credit. And despite the expetced post-vaccination rebound, the argument is that a fragile economy should not be subject to tax rises and spending cuts at this precise moment. Borrow more from the public right now, don't tax them more.","Sir Keir Starmer's argument is that Covid has ""changed the axis of the economy"" and that the public is now comfortable with a government doing more to help, invest, and protect families and businesses."
"The airline said on Tuesday that fares would not change, because the surcharge would be ""absorbed"" into base fares. The move comes despite a call for the airline industry to cut fares on falling oil prices. But Qantas said air fares were very competitive and lower than when the surcharge was introduced a decade ago. ""If you look at the trends in global aviation over the past decade, costs and competition have been increasing while fares and airline margins have been falling,"" said Chief Executive Alan Joyce in a statement. ""The dynamics of this market have seen Qantas International post significant losses in the past two years,"" he said, adding that yields were still significantly lower than before the global financial crisis. The national carrier is recovering from the heavy losses and announced last month that it expects to post its best first-half result since 2010. That compares to its record A$2.8bn ($2.2bn; £1.5bn) net loss in the 12 months to June last year. Oil's impact Oil prices have fallen 60% since a peak in June, and in December the International Air Transport Association (Iata) predicted that average return fares for passengers would be more than 5% lower this year. But Qantas pointed out that with the lower fuel prices, Iata estimates that net profit airlines make per passenger this year will increase by just $1 to $7, compared with last year. Qantas is not the first airline to scrap the oil surcharge on air fares. Rival carrier Virgin Australia ended its last remaining fuel surcharges last week, while Malaysian budget airline AirAsia said on Monday that it was also removing them in all its regional affiliates and long-haul operations. In the Middle East, Emirates said it was considering removing the charge last week, while Qatar Airways said it will reduce the cost.","Australian carrier Qantas will axe fuel surcharges on international ticket prices, but will raise base air fares to compensate for the cut."
"The EC said both passengers and freight services are paying over the odds for using the track through the tunnel, which is operated by Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel is a private company owned by the investors who paid for and now run the Channel Tunnel. Eurotunnel said its charges are ""transparent and not excessive."" The EC has formally called on the British and French governments to look into the pricing structure and to comply with European Union rules against excessive track access charges. The European Commission said the high prices Eurotunnel charges the train companies get passed onto passengers. The EC also said that freight companies are put off using the Channel Tunnel because of the ""excessive"" charges, preferring to send their goods by road, which causes traffic congestion and pollution. The Commission claims 43% of the Channel Tunnel's capacity is currently unused. Vice-President of the European Commission Siim Kallas said: ""'The Channel Tunnel is not being used to its full capacity because of these excessive charges. ""As a result, more freight is being carried on lorries instead of by rail, freight operators and their customers are being over-charged, and passengers are paying over the odds for their tickets. The current regime is also stifling growth in the rail sector,"" he added. In a statement, Eurotunnel said that it has ""always sought the development of cross-Channel traffic and concentrates significant resources on this goal"". 'Weak regulator' The European Commission also said that the regulator which oversees the tunnel, the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) is weak and far from independent. The Commission said the IGC ""does not have the power to adopt decisions on its own initiative without a complaint"". The EC added that the IGC is not an independent body, because it is made up of representatives appointed by the UK and French governments. In a statement, the European Commission said: ""Lack of independence of a rail regulator can lead to failure by the regulator to address complaints by operators in an independent manner or to adopt decisions to force compliance with EU rules and thus can lead to distortions of competition"". Reacting to the assertions of the Commission, a UK Department for Transport spokesman said that ""it is not accepted that the UK has failed to implement the relevant EU rules regarding the Channel Tunnel or that the IGC is not independent"".","Passengers travelling through the Channel Tunnel are being overcharged, according to the European Commission."
"Like-for-like sales in the last three months of 2010 fell 5.8% as the freezing conditions caused ""widespread disruption"". Toy sales were hardest hit after the firm cut off Christmas online orders early to ensure delivery. Meanwhile Clinton Cards said the weather had seen sales fall 2.1% in the last five weeks of the year. It said ""the impact of such adverse weather conditions"" was ""disappointing"" and that full-year profits would be ""significantly lower"" than market expectations. Both firms saw their share prices fall, with Mothercare closing 5.5% lower and Clintons dropping 10.7%. However, there was better news from Majestic Wine, which thanked ""loyal customers for battling through December's dreadful weather conditions"" as it saw UK like-for-like sales growth - which strips out the impact of new stores - of 3.7% in the nine weeks to 3 January. But the firm said sales were half their normal level on the Saturday before Christmas - traditionally its best trading day of the year. Meanwhile, separate data from the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) suggested that snow had played a part in causing the UK's service sector to slow for the first time in 20 months in December. Weather 'victims' Mothercare said that the poor weather had reduced UK like-for-like sales in the third quarter by about 4%, and that its out-of-town shopping centres had particularly suffered from the disruption. And it warned that annual gross profits from the UK would be lower than the £41m previously stated, adding that the consumer environment remained ""difficult"". However, the firm has continued to see strong growth in its international business where sales grew by 17.6% between September and January compared with same period a year earlier. ""Despite growing international sales, an already challenged UK business now forms another victim of the cold weather,"" said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. ""The group's shift towards out-of-town premises appears to have worked against it, whilst like rival Next, the fragilities of time critical direct online Christmas sales have been exposed."" Earlier this week, Next said the December snow had cost it £22m in Christmas sales, but that profits remained on target. And HMV blamed the bad weather as well as ""challenging trading conditions"" for a 10% fall in festive sales, and warned profits would be at the lower end of forecasts. 'Concern' Public spending cuts and the arctic conditions were seen as factors in the slowing of the service sector, according to the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey. Its reading slipped to 49.7 in December from 53 in November. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Hotels, restaurants, caterers and personal services faced most disruption, the report said. The data ""posed a genuine cause for concern"" according to Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club. ""Temporary factors such as poor weather conditions may well be the reason for such a drastic fall... however underlying trends such as a fall in employment for the third consecutive month imply that the services sector overall remains weak,"" she said. Earlier this week, PMI figures for the manufacturing sector indicated it had enjoyed the strongest growth in 16 years in December. ""There is a strong indication that UK economic growth is completely reliant upon export sales while domestic demand has wilted,"" said Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson.

"As the eurozone debt crisis has unfolded, official figures showed that the Hungarian government's total debt had risen to 82% of its output, as its currency, the forint, has weakened. Hungary has said it wants ""a new type of co-operation"" with the IMF. The IMF team in Budapest will now return to Washington to discuss the request. The IMF confirmed that it and the European Commission had received a request for assistance. ""The authorities... indicated that they plan to treat as precautionary any IMF and EC support that could be made available,"" the IMF added. Last week, Hungary's economy ministry said in a statement: ""The government has started talks with the IMF and the EU about a new agreement that, instead of austerity measures, will aid Hungary's economic growth."" The forint fell to a record low against the euro last week and government bond yields have soared. Most mortgages in Hungary are denominated in a foreign currency, in particular the Swiss franc. The weakness of the forint - combined with the strength of the safe haven franc - has made these mortgages painfully expensive for Hungarians top repay. Two ratings agencies have warned that Hungary could lose its investment-grade credit rating due to its weak growth outlook and unpredictable policy track. Hungary is one notch above so-called ""junk"" status, meaning its cost of borrowing could soar without help. The nation received an IMF-led bailout in 2008, but Prime Minister Viktor Orban ended the 2008 IMF deal, which had been agreed under the previous government, last year. Since then, he has put in place a series of unconventional measures, including big taxes on banks and an effective nationalisation of pension funds.",Hungary has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU) for financial assistance.
"By Anthony ReubenBusiness reporter, BBC News But analysis of House of Commons Library figures last week by the Press Association suggests it could be the biggest 12-month period we've had. In the financial year 2015-16, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reckons the government could raise about £32bn from selling public assets, the biggest chunk of which would be about £13bn from the sale of the government's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, followed closely by about £12bn from the sale of UK Asset Resolution, which owns the remaining bits of Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley. Other big price-tag sales include more of the government's stake in RBS, Royal Mail and the Student Loan book. PA adjusted previous years of privatisations to current money and found that 2015-16 would be the biggest year for privatisations by far. The previous high-water marks had been 1987 when chunks of BA, BAA, BP and Rolls-Royce raised about £22.7bn in today's money, and 1991 when the sale of parts of BT, National Power, PowerGen and regional electricity companies in Scotland raised about £22.6bn. Now, these figures are not perfect - for starters we are comparing a financial year, 2015-16, with previous calendar years. Also, IFS director Paul Johnson's recent review of inflation statistics warned against the use of RPI for anything whatsoever as a result of its statistical flaws. Even so, the difference between 2015-16 and any year since the start of the Thatcher era in 1979 is startling. The OBR suggests that we won't be seeing another year like it any time soon, predicting total proceeds of £32bn from the rest of the remaining four years of the parliament put together. But that figure is only made up of continuing sales of the RBS stake and the Student Loans book. The Conservatives' manifesto this year was very clear that the party planned to continue selling stakes in bailed-out banks and building societies and also that it would continue to sell unneeded government property. But there was no mention of any of the other rumoured sales such as the Royal Mint or the Met Office. The sale of the government's stake in Eurostar has been announced, but there are still difficulties in the sale of the stake in Urenco, which is a supplier of nuclear fuel. It's important to remember what the sale of public assets does for the public finances. It does not reduce the deficit, which is the amount the government needs to borrow in a year. It does reduce the country's overall debt, which also reduces the amount of interest that has to be paid each year. On the other hand, while the government gets cash upfront when it privatises something, it loses its share of any profits that might have been made in the future.","It was always going to be a big year for privatisations, with assets such as bits of Lloyds, RBS and Royal Mail being sold."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter But contrary to belief, bingo is no dying religion. UK clubs still have 45 million visits a year, and the game's followers are getting younger every year. Furthermore, for the first time in nearly seven years the UK will this month see the opening of a brand-new 1,000-seat venue, in Southampton. Customers will enjoy a ""pub feel"", with sofa seats, music, and the ambiance of a night club. It will certainly be no silent cathedral. The opening is one reason why experts anticipate that, after years of falling revenues, we will spend over £30m a year more on bingo by 2019. So, in an era of electronic and online pleasures, what on earth is it about bingo that still appeals? 'A good buzz' On a Wednesday night, two weeks before Christmas, 350 enthusiasts are packed into a bingo hall (actually the company prefers the word 'venue' - it sounds more modern) in the suburbs of Nottingham. With few empty seats, it is what players might justifiably call a full house. ""On its own, number three,"" announces caller Winston Baugh, as he strides between tables. But traditional bingo like this now only takes up half the club. While an older generation of devotees listens in silence to the caller, there is also a lounge area with a much more irreverent feel. Here players can chat or text, while they keep one eye on the bingo. They can even play on an electronic tablet, which automatically keeps track of the numbers. ""It's a shush-free environment, where music and talk is allowed,"" says Stuart Colthart, Mecca Bingo's area manager. ""You get quite a good buzz in here."" Age target Amongst the younger players enjoying the lounge are Chris Norman, who's 28, and his sister Lisa, who's 32. It was they who introduced their mother to the game, not vice-versa. ""This is my second night this week,"" enthuses Chris. But he admits he gets teased by his friends, some of whom think bingo is distinctly un-cool. ""I don't know if it's cool, but most of the people in here are not old,"" says Lisa. ""We get up to 10 people round the table on someone's birthday. It's a whole family thing."" The industry is working hard - and succeeding - in attracting players like Chris and Lisa. ""We're not necessarily after 18-24 year-olds,"" says Stuart Colthart. ""If we could get the average age down to 41 or 45, we'd be happy."" But he has some way to go to reach that target. Currently the industry average is about 61 or 62. Marshmallows On Friday and Saturday nights at the Mecca club in Nottingham it is house party time. Often that will include rock and roll bingo, where players have to tick off particular tracks as they hear them. In fact there is everything from Elvis impersonator nights, involving karaoke, to family games like rock, paper, scissors. One favourite is ""How many marshmallows can I stuff in my mouth?"" ""You put as many marshmallows in your mouth as you can; then it's the person who can say 'fluffy bunny' best who wins,"" says Winston Baugh. This may bring to mind some post-war holiday camp. But in an era when people sometimes only talk to telephones, it is also real interaction; and self-evidently it is fun. 'Rebel' bingo If you want something truly alternative - which packs in crowds of young people - there is also Rebel Bingo, which is proving a big hit in Camden, north London. The music is loud, the atmosphere is more like a party in Ibiza, and traditional bingo players would hate it. Party-goers are issued with bingo cards, but there the similarity ends. ""There is music and DJs and lots of lights, and confetti,"" says one of the founders, Freddie Sorensen. ""People call out numbers. People dab off numbers. Some people win prizes, some people don't."" Students seem to catching the bug too. Possibly because the food and drink is cheap. ""Twenty years ago we would never see a student in a club,"" says Simon Wykes, the chief executive of Gala Bingo, which is opening the new Southampton venue. ""Now, in some clubs, students make up 20% of the customer base."" UK Bingo: The numbers 354 total venues Gala: 132 Mecca: 93 Others: 129 'Alive and kicking' In March 2014, the Chancellor George Osborne declared that the number of bingo halls had plummeted by three-quarters over the last 30 years. After much lobbying by the industry, he then halved the tax on bingo hall profits from 20% to 10%. The action seems to have had the desired effect. While fifteen clubs shut their doors in 2014, ten closed in 2015. Now the industry believes the long-term decline may finally be over. ""The reduction has stabilised,"" says Miles Barron, chief executive of the Bingo Association. ""The decline of bingo has halted, and we have great confidence that volumes will go back up."" ""There is no chance of this industry dying. We are very much alive, kicking and ready to grow."" Simon Wykes, CEO Gala Bingo That claim is reinforced by the research group Mintel. It forecasts that spending in UK bingo halls will rise from £690m in 2014, to £728m by 2019, largely as a result of the chancellor's duty reduction. The private investment group Caledonia certainly has confidence in the future, having just bought Gala's bingo operations for £241m. And while Gala itself admits that we may not have seen the last of club closures, it believes the British will never give up on bingo. ""There is no chance of this industry dying. It's been stable for so long,"" says Simon Wykes. ""We are very much alive, kicking, and ready to grow.""","The word itself brings to mind a draughty hall populated by coated ladies, eyes lowered in reverence, like devoted church-goers paying homage from their pews to a god of guilty pleasures."
"The official told Reuters news agency that a comment made earlier ""signalled concern about excess moves in the yen"". ""Japan will be in the spotlight at the G20 in Moscow this weekend,"" he added. Earlier, Japan had interpreted the comments as not showing concern about attempts to weaken the yen. When the clarification came, the Japanese currency surged against both the US dollar and the euro. The yen rose to 93.69 per dollar, while one euro bought 125.75 yen. This week the talk of ""currency wars"" has been inflamed as France expressed concern at the strength of the euro at a eurozone finance ministers meeting. Poor communication Countries are attempting to devalue their weaker currencies in order to make their exports cheaper. The subject will be discussed at a meeting of G20 finance ministers later this week in Moscow. The earlier G7 statement, released on the Bank of England's website, said: ""We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates"" However, the part that seems to have been overlooked is: ""We are agreed that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability"" Richard Gilhooly, fixed-income strategist at TD Securities in New York, said: ""Rather than calm the markets, the poorly communicated statement has significantly raised volatility and now we have to wait to see the actual outcome of G20 on the weekend."" Japan's Prime Minister - Shinzo Abe - has been trying to kick-start the country's economy since being elected last December. He wants to get domestic prices rising and has taken action to weaken the yen.",The yen has jumped against major currencies after an official representing the G7 rich nations clarified a statement it had made on the currency markets.
"In a speech in the City of London, Mr Hammond said the UK needed to protect patterns of trade with the EU that had been ""built over decades"". The chancellor also used his Mansion House speech to confirm taxes will have to go up to boost spending on the NHS. But he said the increase would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels post-Brexit. In the past the chancellor has come under fire from supporters of Brexit. Earlier this month Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner. However, addressing a City audience on Thursday, Mr Hammond said the ""immediate key"" to the UK and London's economic success was ""ensuring we get a good Brexit deal"". He said the goal was a partnership that ""recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners, and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe"". As the UK leaves the EU, he said the new relationship should ""maintain low friction borders and open markets"". He went on: ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, 'the enemy of Brexit'; rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it."" Mr Hammond also said the £20bn five-year NHS funding package announced by the prime minister this week would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels. However, he also said the government would stick to its fiscal rules and ""continue to reduce debt"". As a result taxpayers will have to ""contribute a bit more"", he added. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a boost in NHS spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by £20bn by 2023. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about £4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent. Mr Hammond said the NHS was the government's ""number one priority for the forthcoming spending review"". ""So, as the Prime Minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS that we all use.""","The Treasury is not ""the enemy of Brexit"", Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has insisted."
"The energy regulator said four million pre-pay customers would be protected by an interim price cap from next April. It added it would work with suppliers to help ""disengaged"" customers to search for cheaper deals. But First Utility's managing director, Ed Kamm, told the BBC the plans were in danger of helping the wrong people. ""Ofgem itself admits that consumers who are already engaged in the market will see the first benefits,"" he said. ""We are in real danger of continuing to fuel a 'tale of two markets' - helping those who already shop around and doing little to properly help those who are continuing to pay much more than they need to or should,"" he added. Bring down bills In its report published on Wednesday, Ofgem said the cap on pre-payment bills would save ""vulnerable"" households money. At the moment, these customers pay an average of £220 a year more than those on the cheapest deals. Asima Khan, a single mother, is one such customer who was put on a pre-payment gas meter by her supplier when she went into arrears 18 months ago. ""When you are on low income and you can't afford much and then you are having to pay so much for gas, it leaves your pocket empty,"" she said. ""You can't eat, you can't cook, you can't feed your children. You either don't cook at home and just use the heating or you really play with everything. ""My boys are now almost professionally trained - you put the heating on 10 minutes before you have a shower and you switch it off immediately. If it's cold, that's just too bad."" Suppliers argue that pre-payment customers are currently charged more because the technology involved in the meters is more expensive, pushing up the cost. As a result of the move to introduce a cap, the regulator said it wanted to knock an average of between £75 and £80 a year off pre-payment bills. However, it described the price cap on pre-payment bills as ""interim"". The reason for that is that smart meters, which are cheaper to install than pre-payment meters, are due to be rolled out throughout the UK by 2020. Customers will then be able to choose to pay in advance or to pay in retrospect. At that point, the cheaper technology involved means there should be no need for energy suppliers to charge customers more for pre-paid energy. Ofgem also promised to co-operate with suppliers to help ""disengaged"" customers on ""expensive standard variable tariffs"" to shop around more. It said the proposals were an ""opportunity to deliver a more competitive, fairer energy market for all consumers"". It welcomed proposals published last month by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) aimed at reforming the energy market. Who has a pre-pay meter? - People in rented accommodation, where the landlord chooses a pre-payment - People who have had trouble paying in the past or who have debts - Owners of second homes who are renting out a property and want to be sure bills are paid - People who choose pre-payment because it is easier and they only use what they have paid for Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said the CMA's final report was a watershed moment for both the industry and consumers and pointed the way to a ""fairer and more competitive future"". ""I call on energy companies and consumer groups to seize this opportunity,"" he said. 'More effective' According to the CMA's two-year investigation, two-thirds of UK households were paying ""over the odds"" for their energy compared with those who have switched to a different tariff. To encourage more switching, Ofgem planned to trial ""more effective prompts"" on customers' bills to encourage them to compare different tariffs. However, Ofgem said it would not be capping standard variable energy tariffs. Mr Nolan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the CMA had decided that capping standard tariffs was not in the best interests of customers. Instead, the CMA had proposed ""a series of remedies"", said Mr Nolan, adding they would make the market fairer and encourage customers to switch energy suppliers. Ofgem believed encouraging competition was the best protection for consumers, he added, and said switching rates had increased over the last year. Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter ""Switch"" says the regulator. ""Switch"" say the energy companies. ""Switch"" say the consumer groups. Do it and you can save £300 to £400 every year. They have been singing from this particular hymn sheet for years. Yet the CMA's final report (paragraph 100, if you're interested) says that more than a third of the 7,000 people it asked still did not realise switching was an option. These people - delightfully referred to as ""the disengaged"" - tend to be on low incomes, have few qualifications, are tenants or are aged over 65, it concludes. Unless they are on a pre-payment meter, the pensioner from Penzance and the breadline family from Bolton are to receive prompts on their bills or letters from suppliers urging them to - you guessed it - switch. Should they automatically be put on the cheapest deal, or at least on a cheaper backstop tariff than now? Ofgem makes it clear such a system will not be introduced. Huge challenge Consumer organisation Which? welcomed Ofgem's report but said the regulator faced a huge challenge in implementing the proposals in a way that stimulated competition. ""The industry will need to commit to working with the regulator to ensure people get a fairer deal on their energy,"" added Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns. One of the ""Big Six"" energy suppliers, EDF Energy, said it supported ""the implementation of the CMA's proposed remedies without delay, so that customers can continue to benefit fully from competition and innovation"". 'Competitive market' However, critics have said it is impractical for most people to check every few weeks whether they were getting the best possible deal. ""It can be difficult - people don't have the time to do these things, but unfortunately, that's the nature of a competitive market,"" the director of energy supply at industry body Energy UK, Audrey Gallagher, told the BBC. ""I think this industry is doing as much as it can to try and reassure consumers that they can switch. There's information about the cheapest deals available currently on every bill,"" she added.","Ofgem's proposals to shake up the energy market put ""too much onus"" on the customer and ""do not go far enough"", says one energy company boss."
"The British bank has also been banned from accepting new dollar clearing accounts without the state's approval. The penalty comes after the bank failed to fix problems identified in 2012. ""If a bank fails to live up to its commitments, there should be consequences,"" the New York State Department's Benjamin M Lawsky said. Standard Chartered said it ""accepted"" the findings of the New York State Department of Financial Services. 'Useless' ""We are continuing the remediation of our AML [anti-money laundering] control issues with the utmost urgency, in addition to improving our compliance programmes generally,"" it added. It said a ""small proportion"" of its clients would be affected by the suspension of dollar clearing for high risk retail clients at its Hong Kong unit, and the banning of high-risk client relationships in the United Arab Emirates. Independent financial analyst Francis Lun told the news agency AFP the fine would have a negative impact on the bank's reputation and international business. ""It's really an oversight on the part of Standard Chartered. They'd already paid a huge penalty [and] still installed a system that is useless,"" Mr Lun said. ""It will create tremendous problems with their international clients who cannot settle their accounts in US dollars. It will be a serious blow to Standard Chartered group's international business,"" he added. Hong Kong's Monetary Authority, which also acts as the city's central bank, said it had been monitoring Standard Chartered's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism controls. ""Although we have identified some areas for improvement, they are not issues that cause significant supervisory concerns, "" it said in a statement. Disproportionate Earlier this month the bank warned it could face more US fines over its money-laundering controls as it reported a 20% fall in half-year profits. In 2012, Standard Chartered agreed a $340m fine with the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) after it was accused of hiding $250bn of transactions with Iran. As part of that agreement an independent monitor was installed at the bank by the DFS, which discovered that Standard Chartered had failed to detect ""a large number of potentially high risk transactions"". Investec securities analysts Ian Gordon called the scale of the fine imposed by the DFS ""distinctly unwelcome"" adding it ""appears disproportionate"". But he said he believed the scale of the impact on Standard Charted would be ""contained"". ""Our initial view is that the adverse earnings impact of the temporary remedial measures should be contained to 1% to 2% of group earnings,"" Mr Gordon added. Standard Chartered is the latest foreign bank to fall foul of New York state and federal authorities for its handling of money transfers from countries and individuals blacklisted by Washington. In the largest case, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay $8.9bn in July to settle charges that for years it knowingly violated US sanctions on Iran and Sudan. BNP Paribas and other banks fined for similar reasons were ordered to implement stringent compliance regimes to ensure they do not break US rules in their dollar-clearing businesses.",Standard Chartered has agreed to pay $300m (£180m) to New York's top banking regulator for failing to improve its money laundering controls.
"By Anna-Catherine BrigidaBBC Global education The Trump administration's pressure on undocumented young migrants - the so-called ""Dreamers"" - could mean many more coming home. But what are so many returning people going to do? Starting a new life in Mexico has been harder than expected for Reyna del Rio, a 29 year old who spent most of her childhood in South Carolina before returning to Mexico. Like many returning bilingual Mexicans, she was able to get a job at a call centre. Tough returning But the long hours and angry customers started to take a toll on her. A new initiative by Mexico's public education ministry, known by the Spanish acronym SEP, could be her ticket to a stable career. ""If you work at a call centre you do things repeatedly. I don't see it as enjoying my job,"" said Ms del Rio. ""I would like to teach and learn new skills. I would like to pass on what I've learned because I think it will fulfil me more than just doing customer service."" She is part of a group of young deportees and voluntary returnees who are in the process of applying for English teaching positions through SEP. It's a project trying to make the most of their English language skills. For more than 600 new teaching jobs, the education ministry adapted the application process to encourage repatriated Mexicans. There were changes to make the positions more accessible to returnees, who often face bureaucratic roadblocks related to their time outside of Mexico. The goal is twofold. It aims to provide employment for young deportees and help Mexico reach its goal of being bilingual - in Spanish and English - in 20 years. ""We made that clause flexible particularly for repatriated Mexicans, because the idea is that no one who might have the possibility of being an English teacher should be left without the chance of doing so,"" said Mario Chavez Campos, director of the general directorate of higher education for professionals in education, an office within SEP. 'Dreamers' sent back As well as those deported, there are others returning by their own choice, although often forced by the lack of higher education and job opportunities. This was the case for Ms del Rio, who left South Carolina at the age of 18, hoping to access better educational opportunities in Mexico, when she couldn't get financial aid as an undocumented student in the US. When she arrived in 2009, she barely remembered the country she left when she was five years old. But she persevered. ""We have the culture of never giving up,"" Reyna said of her fellow ""Dreamers"". ""We have always had to fight for many things."" These undocumented young people, who might have come to the US as children, are feeling vulnerable. President Donald Trump decided in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, known as DACA. This allowed young undocumented immigrants to work legally in the US and be temporarily shielded from deportation. About 800,000 youths received protected status under DACA, and more than 600,000 were from Mexico. Many could soon face deportation as their DACA permits expire in the upcoming months. Retraining as teachers Mexico has pledged to support returning deportees, with initiatives to help them access employment, health and education. But many of these still remain promises. So far 80% of the returned deportees trying to get a job as an English teacher through SEP have had difficulty meeting requirements, primarily for reasons related to their time spent outside of Mexico, according to Israel Concha, founder of the New Comienzos group which support people returning to Mexico. More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series? Get in touch. ""They have to understand it's an emergency,"" said Mr Concha, a deportee himself. ""Tomorrow if thousands of people get deported because there is no immigration reform or there is nothing for DACA, we need to be ready and the federal government is not ready."" To be eligible for teaching, all candidates must have their US schooling recognised in Mexico, pass a test in Spanish grammar and Mexican history, and earn a college degree. The scheme intends to break down the barriers returnees face in completing these steps, but there are still discussions about how to achieve this. Mexican dream Not all bilingual deportees have the training required to become a teacher, so the SEP is brainstorming other ways to incorporate Dreamers into English language lessons at public schools, such as through conversation clubs or as teacher's assistants. ""This call for English teachers is just the first step,"" said Mr Chavez Campos of the public education ministry. ""From there, we have a list of the dreamers and deportees who are interested in participating in the national English strategy."" He says this is Mexico's ""rapid response to the migration policies of the US"". Working as an English teacher would mean a new start for many of Mexico's deportees. If selected to be an English teacher for SEP, Ms del Rio would receive much more than the minimum wage with a starting salary of about $1,100 (£830) per month, plus benefits and holidays. Unlike working in a call centre, an English teaching position would provide a long-term career. ""We need more opportunities where we can have a job where we can retire,"" said Mr Concha. ""That's what we are looking for: the actual American dream in Mexico."" ""The Mexican government wants to make Mexico bilingual in 20 years,"" said Mr Concha. ""What better place to start than the dreamers that are coming back?""",Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans are deported to their home country each year from the United States.
"The ""Better World Summit"" will also explore how to boost the world economy in the wake of the pandemic. Meanwhile, HSBC has issued a statement defending its cooperation with the US in a case against Huawei. It came after Chinese state media accused the London-headquartered bank of “setting traps to ensnare” Huawei. The world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker said the summit will feature talks by technology industry executives and experts from around the world, including Huawei's deputy chairman Guo Ping as well as South Africa's telecoms minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. The event is being held against the backdrop of growing pressure on the company as tensions rise between Beijing and western governments. On Friday, an article in China's official People’s Daily newspaper said HSBC had ""framed” Huawei and played a role in the arrest of the company's finance chief Meng Wanzhou. The following day, HSBC posted a statement on the Chinese social media platform WeChat which said it was not involved in Washington's decision to investigate Huawei or arrest Ms Meng. It also said “HSBC has no malice against Huawei, nor has it ‘framed’ Huawei”. In response, another Beijing-controlled newspaper, The Global Times, said: ""Chinese observers called HSBC's statement 'not persuasive' at all"". Meanwhile, the US has been calling on members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance - which also includes the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to avoid Huawei kit. Australia has barred Huawei from providing 5G technology for the country's network. Earlier this month, the British government banned the country's mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year. The companies were also told they must remove all of the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027. It follows sanctions imposed by the US government, which claims Huawei poses a national security threat - something the company denies. As early as this week a court in Canada will open a hearing into what evidence should be made public in proceedings on whether to extradite Ms Meng to America.",Chinese technology giant Huawei starts a four-day online event today focusing on how technology can be used in the fight against the coronavirus.
"The plane has been grounded following the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crash earlier this month. Documents seen by the BBC confirm that the software update will limit the operation of the controversial MCAS system. That was the same system used by a Lion Air 737 Max which crashed off the coast of Indonesia last year. Investigators say there are ""clear similarities"" between the two. Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg, who is the chairman, president and chief executive of the company, said in an open letter: ""Soon we'll release a software update and related pilot training for the 737 Max that will address concerns discovered in the aftermath of the Lion Air Flight 610 accident."" He said the company had been working in ""full co-operation"" with the relevant authorities and regulators. There will also be changes to the cockpit warning systems, the flight crew operating manual will be updated and there will be computer-based training for pilots. It is not clear how long the 737 Max will remain grounded. Investigators looking into the Ethiopian Airlines received data from the aircraft's flight recorders, downloaded by experts in France, earlier this week. They intend to to issue a preliminary report by mid-April. On Tuesday, investigators examining black box recordings from the flight said they had found ""clear similarities"" with the previous crash. The French BEA accident authority did not detail the similarities, but media reports suggested they found similar flight angles before the crashes. It comes amid continuing questions over 737 Max's design and vetting to fly. Both the Ethiopian Airlines flight eight days ago and the Lion Air aircraft in October crashed within minutes of take-off. In the case of the Lion Air flight, pilots had difficulties with a new system on the Boeing 737 Max which is designed to keep the plane from stalling. It prevents a jet from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight showed the automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times. Understated power US regulators and safety experts are now asking how thoroughly the FAA and Boeing vetted the anti-stall system and how well pilots around the world were trained for it when their airlines bought new planes. Over the weekend, a report in the Seattle Times claimed that some analysis before the crash found that the system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, revealed crucial flaws. It claims that managers at the FAA instructed its safety engineers to delegate safety assessments to Boeing and to approve the resulting analysis. The report alleges that the analysis produced by Boeing understated the power of the control system and that it could reset itself every time the pilot responded. This meant that the system could repeatedly push the nose of the plane down. Boeing's Mr Muilenburg said the company was in close touch with the authorities: ""We've been working in full cooperation with the US Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board on all issues relating to both the Lion Air and the Ethiopian Airlines accidents since the Lion Air accident occurred in October last year."" Meanwhile, Air Canada has announced that it is updating its schedule until at least 1 July to give its customers ""some certainty when booking and travelling"". The airline had been expecting delivery of six new planes in March and April, but has been substituting different aircraft on the 737 Max routes.",Boeing has told airlines it expects to have new software for its 737 Max plane ready by the end of the month.
"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold at near zero on Wednesday, saying it would keep them there for as long as necessary. A Fed statement said there were signs of an economic pick up recently. But it warned that the long term path of the economy was bound up with the path of the virus. ""Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year,"" policymakers said at the end of their latest two-day meeting. All members of the Fed's policy-setting committee voted to leave the target range for short-term interest rates at between 0% and 0.25%, where it has been since 15 March when Covid-19 was starting to take hold in the country. Republicans introduce $1tn pandemic recovery plan The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' ""The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the statement said, adding: ""The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus."" Economists said the Fed's stance on interest rates suggests they are unlikely to rise significantly for quite some time. Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said: ""We forecast that rate lift-off will not take place until mid-2024 as inflation struggles to reach 2% on a sustained basis and the unemployment rate lags [behind] improvement in the overall economy."" Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst Greg McBride said the Fed's low-rate strategy had kept credit flowing to consumers and businesses, helping to support the housing market and retail spending. ""But they can't tame the virus or manufacture demand, and that's what the economy desperately needs in order to bounce back,"" he said.",The US central bank has repeated its vow to protect the US economy amid rising coronavirus rates and worries about growth.
"Robert PestonEconomics editor This momentous event feels almost unreal to me now. At the time, global markets were in turmoil and I was working all hours of the day and night, seven days a week, in an attempt to make sense of what was going on. But although this is history, it's important to recognise that Lehman's brutal demise was the trigger of the great crash and worst global recession for well over 60 years. But it was not the cause. Think of Lehman as a heart attack afflicting a body - the financial system - whose arteries were clogged and which was carrying dangerous amounts of flab as a result of reckless living over many years. If it had simply been a case of a single bank pushing the boat out too far, there would not have needed to be unbelievably expensive taxpayer-financed bailouts of banks and financial institutions all over the world, from RBS and Lloyds/HBOS in the UK, to UBS in Switzerland, and Bank of America, Citigroup and AIG in the US, among many others. The question is whether the financial system is now in shape, and capable of absorbing the inevitable knocks and bruises to which all constructs of frail humans are prone, without inflicting too much cost on the rest of the economy or taxpayers. What has been done in five years to prevent banks holding entire economies to ransom when they run into difficulties? Well, there has been a good deal of reform and rehabilitation - though it is a long way from being finished. The first thing to note is that the thrust of reform has been to sanitize the existing system, not to impose fundamental structural change on it. Individual banks have sold loss-making or peripheral assets, unwound some of the more toxic assets and adopted a more prudent approach to lending (and in the process of mending themselves, staunched the supply of new credit, thus holding back the recovery of many economies, including our own). But many banks are still enormous, especially in the UK. They have not been forcibly broken up or dismantled; they remain too big to fail, in the jargon. Right now, if one of the biggies found itself in dire straits again, taxpayers would ride to the rescue once more, for fear of the havoc to the economy that chaotic failure would wreak. Of course, if you are one of the five million customers of Lloyds who are today becoming customers of TSB, as Lloyds meets the obligation placed on it by the European Commission to spin off 630 branches into a new bank, you probably think the big banks are shrinking. But what Lloyds is being forced to sell represents only a sixth of its network, and a much smaller proportion of its assets and liabilities. And, anyway, Lloyds isn't one of the very biggest banks. Barclays, HSBC and RBS are much bigger. Their individual balance sheets remain larger than the UK's annual economic output, which raises the legitimate fear that they they are too big to save (rather than too big to fail), for an over-stretched British public sector. The other important respect in which there has not been root-and-branch change is that the international rules, called the Basel rules, for ensuring that banks hold enough capital, to absorb losses without eating into depositors' precious savings, have been amended but not scrapped. The point is that part of what went appallingly wrong in the boom years before 2007/8 is that banks cynically exploited these rules - especially the so-called risk-weightings attached to different categories of loan - to hold as little capital as possible. The effect of this gaming of the Basel rules is that the likes of Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland appeared to have more than enough capital to cope with whatever accidents might come their way, when in fact they had only the tiniest sliver of such protection for their depositors. There is an argument that after Lehman, the Basel rules should have been torn up, and replaced with much simpler rules - which could be more effectively policed and monitored by regulators and shareholders. That did not happen. In practice, the rules have become much more complicated. It is true that risk-weightings have been or are being amended to better reflect the perceived risks of different kinds of lending and financial trading; and banks are being instructed to hold more capital in relation to all categories of lending and investing. But if anything the rules have become more complicated, which means that it is arguably even harder to see the underlying risks being taken by banks, and the opportunity for gaming the rules in future years has probably been elevated. If sunlight is the best disinfectant, we should worry that banks still operate behind a glass darkly. The final area where there has been sanitisation, not reconstruction, is in pay and rewards. Without labouring the point, it is still possible for bankers to earn magnificent sums working for institutions still dependent on guarantees from the state, from taxpayers - which some would see as inappropriate. However, those rewards will in theory at least be more closely dependent on the real longer-term performance of the relevant banks, rather than being the spoils of short-term illusory profits. To put it another way, bankers' pay is still enormous, but the risk of ginormous bonuses being a reward for bankrupting the rest of us has been reduced. None of which, I hope, is to create the impression that nothing important has been fixed since since Lehman. But I would characterise this as mending the status quo, rather than replacing it. Here is what has happened: There is also a good deal of work in progress. One of the more important projects is to prevent better regulation of the banks shunting all the risks of finance over to unregulated firms - so-called ""shadow banks"" - in a dangerous way. To state the bloomin' obvious, there is no point making banks safer, if by doing so we have simply created a whole new species of financial weapons of mass wealth-destruction. If, for example, the supply of loans to the economy came to a halt because a series of hedge funds, and peer-to-peer lenders, or other new-generation lenders went Pete Tong, we would not take much comfort from the fact that the culprits were not official banks. Also under review is how to ""resolve"" banks that get into difficulties at minimum cost to taxpayers. This will involve making it easier to hive off and protect the parts of banks viewed as essential to the functioning of the economy (our deposits, the system for moving money around and the loan-making processes) and bailing-in rather than bailing-out. If you are still with me (you are probably the only one) bailing-in is where losses are forced on professional investors who have lent to banks, as opposed to bailing out, where the rescue costs are heaped mainly on taxpayers. That is why what is going on at the Co-op Bank is an incredibly important precedent. The attempt to rescue it involves arguably the UK's first bail-in, an initiative to dump £500m of losses on its bondholders rather than taxpayers. You should now have a reasonable grasp of what has happened since the Lehman disaster to protect us the next time greed in finance gets the whip hand over judgement, prudence and probity. Can we be entirely confident that there won't be another financial meltdown for at least a further 60 or 70 years, and that the costs of the next meltdown will be less catastrophic? That is not obvious. First, and which won't come as surprise to readers of this column, we continue to inhabit a world of biggish hazards - hazards from the potential shock of a pricking of the two big bubbles of more recent vintage, in government bonds (from quantitative easing) and in Chinese debt and property, and hazards from a eurozone banking system that remains fragile, and to which all other banks are connected. Second, channelling much of the trading at investment banks through central exchanges and clearing systems is to replace a new risk for an old one. The pooling of trading may be to make the risks more visible, but it is also to concentrate those risks. Just because exchanges, clearing and settlement systems have a history of failing less frequently than individual banks doesn't mean they can't ever fail. And nor does it mean they can't fail catastrophically. If, as happened in the notorious ""flash crash"" of 2010, central markets in currencies and derivatives suddenly went haywire, we might begin to question whether the Lehman debacle was quite as bad as it can get.","At the end of this week, on 15 September, it will be the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers."
"By Matthew WallBusiness reporter, BBC News And he, like the bank he runs, will challenge your preconceptions. For starters, this African-born, Swedish chief executive of Handelsbanken's growing UK operation doesn't receive an annual bonus. He hasn't seen his bank fined for incentivising his staff to flog inappropriate products. And unlike many high-flying bank bosses who seem driven more by short-termism and share options than corporate loyalty, Mr Bouvin has been with the Swedish bank for 28 years. Most surprisingly, the 55-year-old supports west London's Queens Park Rangers Football Club with a passion intriguing for a Swede who spent the first 10 years of his life growing up in Zimbabwe. 'Exotic figure' Mr Bouvin's father was Sweden's honorary general consul to Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was then called, and the head of an asbestos mine. Mr Bouvin recalls childhood memories of he and his brother fighting with bundles of fluffy asbestos, savannah watering holes fringed with antelope, zebra and lion, and their car being chased by angry rhinos through the bush. But all that changed abruptly when his parents moved back to Sweden in 1968. The contrast between the rigid formalism of Rhodesia and the liberalism of 1960s Malmo was extreme, he says. ""Sweden was very good for me. It was like total freedom after my regimented boys' school [in Zimbabwe],"" says Mr Bouvin. ""As a Swede who didn't speak Swedish I was quite an exotic figure."" But he picked up the language quickly, fitted in, and was obviously academically gifted. ""At first I thought I wanted to be a diplomat,"" he says. ""But then I realised I was actually more interested in business and macroeconomics."" He received a degree in economics from the University of Lund, Sweden, as well as spending two years in France, at the Sorbonne in Reims and the University of Montpellier. 'Thrillingly boring' Handelsbanken was the first company Mr Bouvin applied to for a job, in 1985. ""I had no idea about the bank's business model at that stage, but was thrilled to be offered a job,"" he says. As luck would have it, he soon realised that he'd landed in a company ""whose values coincided completely with my own"". Those values - long-termism, and a philosophy of decentralisation encapsulated in the slogan ""the branch is the bank"" - seem almost too good to be true in a current banking era of fines, debt crises and outsourced customer service. Big banks, according to the popular narrative, were the primary causers of the global debt crisis thanks to their reckless investment in high-risk mortgage-backed bonds. Critics dubbed them ""casino banks"" that had subverted old-fashioned, prudent banking. But Handelsbanken remained above the fray, emerging with a balance sheet strong enough to make European banking regulators purr with delight. Even one of its institutional shareholders described the group as ""thrillingly boring"". No marketing Mr Bouvin argues that the group's success - it made £1bn in global after-tax profits for the first nine months of 2013 - is down to the bank's belief in the primacy of customer service and localism. The branch manager is trusted to make prudent lending and investment decisions based on one-to-one relationships with customers. ""Working in the branch network was the best thing I ever did,"" says Mr Bouvin. ""I flourished building customer relationships, and being empowered to make customers satisfied was really great."" This local empowerment - the apparent antithesis of modern automated banking - is core to Handelsbanken's philosophy, first proposed by the bank's then boss Jan Wallander in 1970. He persuaded shareholders it was in their long-term interests for the bank to grow organically, using profits, not debt, to fund new branch openings. And the bank does almost zero marketing because, as Mr Bouvin says: ""Our customers don't feel better because they can read the bank's name on a football shirt or on the side of a bus."" This next to no marketing keeps overheads down and return on equity up. At Handelsbanken returning a share of the profits to long-term staff is also key. If the bank exceeds the average profitability rate of its peers, then surplus profits are put into a fund and distributed to all the staff. But they can only receive these accumulated benefits when they turn 60, thus encouraging long-term thinking and loyalty. Some long-serving staff retiring now are receiving payouts in the region of £1.4m, says Mr Bouvin. Shooting birds With 169 UK branches from Aberdeenshire to Cornwall, the bank's British operation is now growing at its fastest rate for five years. Mr Bouvin says Handelsbanken, which has its headquarters in London, is expanding to meet increased demand while some of its larger rivals get smaller. ""Many banks are having to absorb huge losses and have had to shrink to repair their balance sheets... and there are clear indications that SMEs [small and medium-sized businesses] are bearing the brunt of this. It's very sad."" All in all, Anders Bouvin appears the least likely candidate for executive burnout you'll ever meet. When not watching his beloved QPR with his similarly fanatical son, he likes to cook experimentally. ""I'm my local fishmonger's favourite customer,"" he says. But underneath the stereotypical Swedish orderliness and calm, a touch of the wild still lurks. When back in Sweden he likes nothing better than hunting grouse in the country's forests and open expanses, unencumbered by any British squeamishness or sentimentality. Anders Bouvin - a poster boy for the acceptable face of banking?",Anders Bouvin is the boss of the most successful bank you've probably never heard of.
"ONS data indicated 2.51 million people were out of work in the three months to April. The jobless rate was unchanged from three months earlier, at 7.8%. Average earnings in the period were 1.3% up on a year earlier, thanks to a sharp rise in April bonus payments. Meanwhile, Jobseeker's Allowance claimants fell a surprise 8,600 in May from a month earlier to 1.51 million. The number of benefits claimants is at its lowest level in two years. Average earnings rose by 3.3% in April alone, versus April 2012, mainly because many companies paid out their bonuses to workers a month later this year. That delay was widely speculated to have been due to the fact that the top rate of income tax fell from 50% to 45% on April 6, with the late bonus payments benefiting from the lower rate. Despite the lift from higher bonuses, the 1.3% jump in total earnings in the three months to April was still well below the rate of inflation, with consumer prices up 2.4% in the year to April. That means that the real purchasing power of wage earners continued to be eroded. Excluding the effect of bonuses, earnings rose an even more paltry 0.9% from a year earlier. Older workers Unemployment in Scotland was down 6,000 over the three months to April. In Wales there was no change in the jobless total. In Northern Ireland unemployment was down by 5,000 and in England unemployment was up by 6,000. Throughout the UK, a record 29.7 million people are now in work. The number of employed people over 65 has reached more than a million, the highest since records began in 1971. Almost one in ten of the over-65s are in work, comprising 615,000 men and 388,000 women. Other ONS data disclosed that public sector employment has fallen by 22,000 to just under 5.7 million, the lowest figure since 2001. Long-term unemployment has increased, with those out of work and seeking a job for over a year rising by 11,000 in April to almost 898,000. ""Whilst any drop in unemployment is welcome, the overall picture is still gloomy,"" said Unison general secretary Dave Prentis. ""There are far too many people out of work, women and long-term unemployed are particularly badly affected, and public sector jobs are being slashed."" The unemployment and earnings figures provoked a heated exchange during Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament. David Cameron said the figures were a sign that the economy was improving. ""They show employment, the number of people in work in our country, going up, they show unemployment going down and the claimant count, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit, has fallen for the seventh month in a row."" But the Labour leader, Ed Miliband said the reality was average earnings were not rising fast enough and many people in the UK were struggling. ""Day in, day out, what people see are prices rising, wages falling while the Prime Minister tells them they're better off. He claims the economy is healing. But for ordinary families life is getting harder."" The figures come a day after another report from the ONS showed the UK's industrial output rose for the third straight month in April.","UK unemployment has fallen by 5,000, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said."
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter Mortgage holidays and jobs furloughing are to end on Saturday, with other support measures starting. But there are still gaps in support that need filling, some organisations have said. The Treasury said it had put in place a number of generous support schemes for individuals and businesses. The mortgage holiday scheme introduced at the start of the Covid-19 crisis ends on Saturday as does the job furlough scheme, which is being replaced by the Job Support Scheme. It will leave a fifth of mortgage holders - around 1.6 million households - worried about paying their mortgage over the next three months, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The poverty campaign charity said: ""There is a real risk that mortgage-holders on low incomes will be pulled into poverty and hardship."" It said 890,000 working households with a mortgage expect to see a drop in earnings over the next month, but 85% of them - 750,000 households - aren't eligible for any government support with their housing costs. ""It's not right that during a time of huge uncertainty, many households are discovering that they are excluded from the only lifeline that could help meet their housing costs,"" said Darren Baxter, policy and partnerships manager at the charity. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation wants the Support for Mortgage Interest payment to be reformed to help people who lose their jobs to keep their homes as they weather the coronavirus storm. Self-employed 'face double hit' Self-employed homeowners could face a double hit as their grants are reduced, the Labour party said. ""Self-employed homeowners are facing a perfect storm because the government has decided to abandon them just as we head into the winter,"" said shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds. ""There's still time for the government to stop a bleak winter for Britain's self-employed workers. ""It must remove the mortgage cliff edge, fix the gaps in its income support schemes, and help people defer the cost of interest payments."" From November, self-employed people will be able to apply for a third grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) to cover the next three months, worth 40% of their pre-virus trading profits. But that figure is down from the 80% offered during the first grant and 70% during the second application period. Renters 'hit' People renting their home are more likely to have fallen behind with their housing costs than mortgagers, according to the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns on living standards. Its research suggests nearly one-in-eight private renters and more than one-in-six social renters are currently unable to cover their housing costs in full. ""Renters are being particularly badly hit,"" said Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation. ""They are much more likely to have lost their jobs and significant numbers are only managing by cutting other expenditures, drawing down on savings or getting into debt in order to meet their rent."" She called on policymakers to ensure the social security system supports struggling families effectively over the coming months and take urgent action to avoid an increase in homelessness. ""But landlords might also need to recognise that as household incomes fall, rents are more likely to need to go down than up,"" she added. Landlords ask for help Landlords, however, have called on the government to give the sector extra help to protect those who are renting. The National Residential Landlords Association warned that 300,000 renters could be at risk of losing their jobs as the furlough scheme closes. It said renters under the age of 35 will face the brunt of the crisis as those who find themselves on benefits will only be able to claim for a room in a shared house. ""With rates of Covid-19 rising, we need to do everything possible to sustain tenancies,"" said Ben Beadle, chief executive of the NRLA. ""The government needs urgently to step in and fund renters who are struggling as a result of the pandemic."" Job Support Scheme The Treasury said the new Job Support Scheme which starts on Sunday, combined with the Job Retention Bonus, will cover at least 95% of the total employment costs for average previously furloughed employee until February. ""The Job Support Scheme will continue to protect jobs throughout the difficult months ahead and is part of our comprehensive Plan for Jobs,"" said Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak. The Treasury added: ""The JSS and JRB are just one part of our generous package of measures, that includes the extended business grants and Self-Employed Income Support Schemes announced last week, which will continue to support businesses and livelihoods across the country over the winter months.""","The end of a range of government support schemes could leave millions of people facing hardship, think tanks and political groups have warned."
"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Limited has been ordered to pay up to 150m won ($133,000; £104,000) to 28 South Korean victims or their families. The court's ruling upholds two separate damages suits against the firm. About 150,000 Koreans were conscripted to work in factories and mines in Japan in the war, and issues from the era continue to sour diplomatic relations. The latest move follows a landmark case in October that found in favour of Koreans seeking compensation from Japan's Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp for wartime forced labour. Mitsubishi Heavy said the court's ruling was ""deeply regrettable"", and that it would take appropriate measures, Reuters reported. 'Regrettable and unacceptable' Japan argues that all financial or other reparation issues related to their 1910 to 1945 rule of Korea should be regarded as settled by a treaty signed between South Korea and Japan in 1965. But the court ruled that the treaty ""does not cover the right of the victims of forced labour to compensation for crimes against humanity committed by a Japanese company in direct connection with the Japanese government's illegal colonial rule and war of aggression against the Korean peninsula"". Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the ruling was ""very regrettable and unacceptable"". He said it was in violation of international law and warned that Japan would consider options including an international law suit unless Seoul took appropriate action to address the issue. Officials in Seoul however have said they respect the Supreme Court verdict, Yonhap news agency reported. What will Mitsubishi pay? The plaintiffs had sued Mitsubishi in Japan, but in 2008 Japan's top court found in favour of the firm. Thursday's ruling ordered the company to pay up to 150m won ($106,896; £83,305) each to four women, and one family member, who said they had been forced to work without pay at a Mitsubishi aircraft plant in Nagoya in 1944. One of the plaintiffs, 90-year-old Kim Seong-ju, cried as she spoke to the press on Thursday. ""I have harboured this grudge for all my life, and I'm still living as if all my bones protrude. That's the weight of my grudges,"" she said, as reported by Yonhap. The second case initially involved six victims, but just two are still alive. Mitsubishi must now pay 80m won to the living victims and the same to be divided among the families of the deceased.",South Korea's top court has ordered a Japanese firm to compensate Koreans it used as forced labour in World War Two.
"Irwin Lipkin, 77, pleaded guilty of helping to hide the fraud from US regulators by falsifying documents. His six-month sentence marks the end of a six-year prosecution saga. A total of 15 people have been convicted for their parts in the Ponzi - pyramid - scheme orchestrated by Madoff that defrauded investors out of billions of dollars. Madoff's fraud emerged in 2008. What was thought to be a fund worth $68bn turned out to be all but worthless having been paid as fake profit or stolen by Madoff and his associates. Madoff pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. The judge rejected the defence case that Lipkin should not be jailed because of his failing health, and that he did not know the full extent of Madoff's scheme. Prosecutor David Abramowicz told the court in New York: Madoff ""didn't do it alone because he couldn't do it alone. He needed the help of people like Mr Lipkin"". Lipkin was hired as one of Madoff's first employees in the 1960s. He apologised to the court, ""and to everybody else who may have been hurt by the things that I've done"".",The final defendant in the $68bn (£44bn) Bernard Madoff fraud case has been jailed.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Interest paid on variable easy access savings accounts has fallen faster in the first half of the year than in the first half of any year since 2009. Financial information service Moneyfacts, which analysed the figures, said savers would be ""frustrated"". Official figures show households are saving more of their disposable income than at any time for four years. The so-called savings ratio revealed UK households saved 8.6% of their disposable income in the first three months of the year, up from 5.4% during the same period last year. This savings ratio data, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggests households were taking a safety-first approach going into lockdown. Other data suggests this accelerated during lockdown itself. Households where residents were still in a job, but likely to be working from home, suddenly had less need or opportunity to spend. Money that might have been spent on commuting or meals out could have been saved instead. As a result, deposits into accounts by households increased by a record £25.6bn in May, following strong increases in March (£14.3bn) and April (£16.7bn), according to the Bank of England. The Resolution Foundation think tank has stressed that this is not the experience of every household. It, and the ONS, have pointed out that the under-30s are likely to have been hardest hit by a fall in income. Lower-income households have been twice as likely as richer ones to have increased their debts during the crisis, the think tank said, as many worked in shutdown parts of the economy. At the point at which many households have looked to save more, the interest offered by banks and building societies has fallen. Two cuts in the Bank of England's base rate, as well as other measures to stimulate the economy, have reduced the need for the banks to use savers' deposits to give out in lending. Moneyfacts data shows that a typical easy access savings account was paying 0.59% in interest at the start of the year, but now only paid 0.24%. Rates when savings are locked away for a set period of time have also fallen. ""Savers will be in for a shock to find the first six months of 2020 have been the worst for rate cuts in over a decade,"" said Rachel Springall, of Moneyfacts. ""This demonstrates how much the market has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and base rate cuts, and it will leave savers feeling frustrated and disappointed."" Spending again? Such low rates could prompt people to spend money in the shops on reopening, rather than save, but commentators suggest uncertainty over jobs would mean people remain safety-conscious. ""Households' spending likely will rebound over the summer, as some recently accumulated cash is spent in reopened shops and businesses,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Nonetheless, employment looks set to decline in the autumn when the government's income support schemes are set to be wound down, while low consumer confidence suggests that households will seek to save a larger proportion of their incomes than they did pre-Covid.""",Many UK households have picked up the savings habit just as the interest rates paid by banks have slumped.
"The company said the sale was the result of a strategy to concentrate on ""higher turnover pub-restaurants"", rather than smaller drinks-only pubs. Of the 202 pubs sold, 158 are from Marston's Taverns estate and 44 are leased pubs. The news came as Marston's reported full-year pre-tax profits of £69.8m ($114m; 83.3m euros). This compares with a £135.5m loss last year. Group revenue rose 9% to £782.9m for the year to 5 October. Chief executive Ralph Findlay told the BBC: ""We aim to use the cash from the pub sales to build new ones. Some pubs are not matching what customers are demanding."" Marston's, whose beer brands include Brakspear, Marston's Pedigree and Hobgoblin, is engaged in a building programme and opened 22 outlets over the year. It currently has about 2,050 pubs in its estate. Food, not beer, has become the main reason people visit pubs, the company said. ""In 2013 we served 30 million meals, with food now the principal reason for around 80% of customer visits in our destination pubs,"" Mr Findlay said in a statement. More disposals of non-restaurant pubs are therefore likely, the company said.","Marston's, the pub operator and independent brewer, has sold 202 pubs to NewRiver Retail for £90m."
"The Report on Jobs, produced monthly by IHS Markit, collects data from 400 UK recruitment and employment firms. Its data suggests permanent placements in July fell at the sharpest rate since May 2009, with participants citing uncertainty caused by Brexit. The results also indicated that some clients of recruitment firms had shifted towards using short-term staff. ""The UK jobs market suffered a dramatic freefall in July, with permanent hiring dropping to levels not seen since the recession of 2009,"" said Kevin Green, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which sponsors the survey. However, Mr Green said it was important not to jump to conclusions from one month's data. ""The truth is we don't know what long term consequences the referendum result will have on UK jobs. With the political situation becoming more stable and the Bank of England making sensible decisions, we may well see confidence return to the jobs market more quickly than anticipated,"" he said. 'Highly cautious' Of the recruitment consultants polled, nearly 38% said they had placed fewer people in permanent positions in July, an increase from 32% in June. Despite this, the survey found that demand for employees was high in many sectors and starting salaries for both permanent and temporary staff increased in July. Nursing and medical care was the most in-demand category for permanent staff during July. Construction workers saw a decline in demand for their services. ""Demand for staff remains strong with vacancies continuing to rise, but the sharp fall in placements suggests that businesses are highly cautious about committing to new hires,"" said Mr Green. ""Economic turbulence following the vote to leave the EU is undoubtedly the root cause."" The survey comes a day after Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said unemployment in the UK was expected to rise to 5.5% over the next two years. It is currently 4.9%.","The number of people in the UK securing a permanent job has fallen for two months in a row, according to a survey."
"The company also said deliveries of its planes slumped to an 11-year low last year. It means the US firm has lost its title as the world's biggest plane maker to European rival Airbus. The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two crashes in which 346 people were killed. Boeing said net orders after cancellations for 2019 totalled just 54 planes. That compares with 893 the previous year. At the same time deliveries fell by 53% to 380 planes, the lowest number since 2007. The company last month halted production of what had been its best-selling commercial airliner. The grounding of the 737 Max means it is impossible for the firm to deliver the planes to customers. In comparison, Boeing's main rival Airbus said earlier this month that it delivered a record 863 planes in 2019 and racked up a net 768 orders after cancellations. A bright spot for the Chicago-based plane maker was a record number of deliveries of 787 Dreamliners in the last three months of 2019. The company delivered 45 of the wide-body passenger jets, which first went into service in 2011. Boeing's new chief executive David Calhoun took the helm of the manufacturer on Monday. Mr Calhoun said he is ""confident in the future"" of the firm, telling staff his ""primary focus"" will be returning the 737 Max to the skies. He replaced Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired last month, in a move the company's board said was necessary to ""restore confidence"" in Boeing. The aviation industry is also feeling the pressure over fears of a global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war.",Boeing has reported its worst annual orders in at least two decades - as it remains in crisis over its 737 Max model.
"The documents detail how the former staff allegedly paid kickbacks to others, including a foreign official, to win work on a new gas pipeline. Four of the five people named have pleaded guilty to the charges. Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce paid £671m to settle corruption cases with UK and US authorities. The unsealed indictment claims that Petros Contoguris, founder and chief executive of a company called Gravitas, devised a scheme with former Rolls-Royce employees James Finley, Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout and Keith Barnett and an individual named Andreas Kohler who worked at a consultancy firm. Money was allegedly paid to staff at the consultancy firm as well as to at least one foreign official but were disguised as commission payments to Gravitas, according to the documents. 'Improper advantage' In exchange for the payments, Rolls-Royce Energy Systems Inc, which is a US subsidiary of the UK engineering giant, won work with Asia Gas Pipeline which is building and connecting a gas pipeline between central Asia and China. Mr Finlay, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce, pleaded guilty on to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and one count of violating the act. Mr Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-Royce, Mr Zuurhout, previously an energy sales employee at the company and Mr Kohler each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Mr Contoguris has been charged but is believed to be outside the US and has not . In a statement, the US authorities said: ""In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy - going as far back as approximately 1999 and continuing into 2013 - to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and instrumentalities across the globe."" Rolls-Royce sold its energy business to Siemens for £785m in 2014.",Charges against three former Rolls-Royce employees and two individuals in relation to an alleged bribery scheme have been revealed by US authorities.
"In September, the High Court said excluding maids from a rule allowing foreigners to settle in the city after seven years was unconstitutional. The government appealed, fearing the ruling could lead to more than 100,000 foreign maids winning residency rights. The case centred on Evangeline Banao Vallejos, a maid from the Philippines. The Court of Appeal said in its 66-page ruling that ""it must be up to the sovereign authority to decide the extent to which the status of permanent resident should be conceded to foreign nationals"". Mark Daly, the lawyer representing Ms Vallejos, said it was ""highly likely"" that they would appeal against the decision in Hong Kong's highest court, the Court of Final Appeal. ""There are strict issues of law but there are also issues of principle. We think we can win on both,"" Mr Daly told BBC News. ""Ms Vallejos is the type of person Hong Kong should be proud to have,"" he added. Ms Vallejos has lived in Hong Kong since 1986, working for the same family. Protests After the initial ruling, thousands of Hong Kong citizens marched to protest against the strain granting residency to maids could place on public services and the job market. The government had estimated that 125,000 helpers would be eligible to apply for abode, and if each had a spouse and two children, that number of potential new residents could reach 500,000. But groups campaigning for domestic workers accused the government of scare-mongering. Delores Balladares from the Asian Migrants Co-ordinating Body, which represents domestic helpers' interests, said they were very disappointed by the decision. ""It legalises discrimination against migrant workers,"" she told BBC News. The case had sparked widespread debate about the rights and working conditions of Hong Kong's 300,000 domestic workers, who mainly come from the Philippines and Indonesia. Not just a luxury for wealthy families, they are a mainstay of Hong Kong family life and allow many middle-class mothers to work outside home. Hong Kong's foreign maids fare better than domestic workers elsewhere in Asia, with a guaranteed minimum wage, statutory holidays and annual paid leave. But their lack of residency rights means that if they leave an employer, they have only two weeks to find a new job otherwise they must return home.",The Hong Kong government has won an appeal against a ruling that could have allowed foreign domestic helpers to apply for residency in the city.
"The events industry has warned of an ""existential threat"" to the sector, while a survey from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found customer-facing businesses, including hospitality, are faring the worst. Hattie Mauleverer used to run Top Hat Catering in London, but the business folded after the number of events dropped off a cliff after lockdown. ""It's been absolutely devastating,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""Eighteen years of my life has just - puff - gone."" The local council declined to provide any rates relief for the business as people did not buy food on the the firm's large kitchen premises. ""Although it was voluntary liquidation, it wasn't much of a choice,"" she says. ""When you're bringing in zero income it's just unsustainable to pay rent, rates, NI [National Insurance], whatever, anything else. So, I had to make that really difficult choice."" ""So absolutely everything has had to go - the liquidators took what they wanted, and it's gone,"" she said. 'Urgent support' needed Industry group the Events Industry Alliance has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak warning that the sector faces an ""existential threat"". It said the decision to impose coronavirus restrictions for a further six months, coupled with many events firms being unable to get access to government support measures, meant the sector was at risk of completely failing. The group said the events industry needed a ""urgent support package"" to keep it afloat. The latest survey from the British Chambers of Commerce also warned that UK firms were struggling, with nearly half of UK companies seeing sales decrease as they endure a sustained cash crunch. Its Quarterly Economic Survey found that business conditions remained weak in the third quarter of 2020, despite much of the economy reopening. Rockpoint Leisure, in New Brighton, on Merseyside, employs 150 people, in its restaurant, pub, barbers-cum-bar, and - most recently - an art gallery. ""We thought we had seen the light at the end of the tunnel, but it has turned out to be an oncoming train,"" says boss Dan Davies. The ""oncoming train"" Mr Davies refers to is the restriction imposed by the government last month on pub closing times. ""The 10pm curfew is killing our trade,"" he says. He said bars and restaurants faced a tough financial quarter as they were still having to employ door people and other staff, but their trading hours were being reduced by the latest lockdown curbs, including the new 10pm closing time. ""The industry has got a long hard winter coming,"" he said. ""A lot of businesses in our sector are not going to be open when the new year comes around."" As well as being a BCC member, Mr Davies also sits on the board of regulatory body the Institute of Licensing, and on the board of trade body UK Hospitality He said the business environment had been tough since lockdown, with him and his business partners having to plough more of their own money in. ""The furlough scheme and Eat Out to Help Out were of benefit to our sector, then the new restrictions were brought in,"" he says. The BCC said ""business conditions remain close to historic lows"", despite signs of improvement in some areas. Its survey looked at 6,410 firms, employing more than 580,000 people across the UK, and found: While the July-to-September period saw an improvement compared with the second quarter, the majority of firms continued to report decreases or no change in sales during the third quarter. Conditions 'exceptionally weak' Adding to the overall gloomy picture, the BCC points out that most of its surveying took place before the prime minister's announcement in the middle of September that a ""second spike"" of coronavirus had hit the UK. It says the subsequent introduction of new national restrictions - such as those experienced by Mr Davies - and tightening local restrictions paint a concerning picture for business conditions in the fourth quarter of the year, Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics, said: ""Our latest survey indicates that underlying economic conditions remained exceptionally weak in the third quarter. ""The manufacturing sector recorded the strongest improvements in the quarter, while consumer-focused services firms, where social distancing restricts activity, saw more limited gains. ""The persistent weakness in cash flow is concerning as it leaves firms more vulnerable to external shocks, including further restrictions."" BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall added: ""Our findings clearly demonstrate that business conditions remain fragile in the face of uncertainty, with the prospect of a difficult winter to come.""","UK catering firms are among those going under as businesses struggle amid the coronavirus restrictions, industry groups have warned."
"The company made a pre-tax profit of 503m euros(£425.6m; $677.8m) in the year to December 2011, after a profit of 84m euros the year before. Revenue rose by 10% to 16.3bn euros, despite an increase in fuel costs of 29.7%. The company said the improvement was against the backdrop of a particularly difficult year in 2010. In 2010, it was affected by disruption from the Icelandic ash cloud, strikes and a weaker economic environment. IAG's chief executive, Willie Walsh, said demand for its North Atlantic routes had remained strong. The airline also said it had cut non-fuel costs by 5.6% last year and increased revenue per passenger by 3.6%. Analyst Keith Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers said IAG's results were encouraging. ""Revenues per passenger are up, whilst non-fuel related costs are down. Exposure to a recovering US economy is considerable, while outdated work practices at Iberia are being addressed. ""On the downside, fuel costs continue to take their toll, denting expected performance in the first half of 2012."" Duty 'destroying jobs' IAG warned that this summer's Olympics in London could depress business from the UK, noting that past experience in other host cities suggested that demand could be dampened during the games. However, the carrier said the event would be ""positive for the long-term position of London as a global destination"". IAG continued its criticism of Air Passenger Duty (APD), which is applied to almost every ticket on a flight originating in the UK. The company said British Airways had paid almost £500m in APD last year, and said that, as a result of the increase to APD due in April, it was reducing by about half the number of new jobs it would create this year. Willie Walsh told the BBC that government should cut the duty for the good of the economy. ""The impact of these very high taxes - the highest in the world - is very negative on the UK economy and is destroying jobs,"" he said. ""So a government that claims to have a growth agenda, that has individual policies then that are undermining the security of jobs and destroying jobs and destroying the opportunity to create jobs really does need to assess these issues."" IAG is planning to expand by buying the BMI airline from Germany's Lufthansa, something that would allow it to boost its services from London's Heathrow airport. However, the deal - which has been strongly opposed by rival carrier Virgin - still needs the approval of regulators. The company said it was hopeful this would be forthcoming.","IAG, the parent firm of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, has reported an increase in annual profits."
"Linda YuehChief business correspondent However, earnings per share beat consensus forecasts at 81 cents versus 75 cents, and the margin on earnings rose to 58% from 50.5%. Alibaba says that gross merchandise sales volumes rose by 49% with active buyers up 45% from a year earlier on its Chinese retail sites. Notably, mobile transactions now account for 42% of Alibaba's business, more than doubling from a year ago when it was 20%. The company says that active mobile users have nearly doubled to 265 million from 136 million a year ago. Those would seem to be impressive figures, but Alibaba shares fell as much as 8% in pre-market trading on the missed revenues. A rare public dispute with the Chinese regulator may also be casting a shadow on the company. The SAIC, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, in a white paper said that Alibaba's biggest e-commerce platforms not only sold fakes, but that the company turned a blind eye to counterfeit goods, and accused Alibaba of ""misconduct"". Alibaba says it is combating counterfeit goods sold by vendors on its various websites. The SAIC said that this discussion with Alibaba over its practices occurred two months before its Initial Public Offering (IPO), but the regulator has only brought it to light now. Well, sort of, since the report has since been taken down from the SAIC's website. The spat with the SAIC may reveal the Chinese government using one of its most prominent companies to set an example to showcase its commitment to crack down and protect intellectual property rights, an ongoing area of dissatisfaction expressed by foreign firms in particular and increasingly by Chinese ones. In any case, Alibaba's share price has come under some pressure as a result over the past two days - dropping some 4% yesterday when the SAIC report was released. Still, at about $90, it is still considerably above the IPO price of $68 from last September. What Alibaba is now experiencing is what other listed firms regularly face - the need to meet market expectations and address bad news, particularly on the regulatory front.","Alibaba, the world's largest e-commerce firm, has reported annual revenue growth of 40% in its debut report since its record-breaking share flotation. That would be impressive for most companies, but the $4.2bn earned fell short of analysts' expectations of $4.4bn."
"The budget airline said the changes would apply until the end of May and numbers may increase. Its boss said new restrictions on travel between the US and mainland Europe put ""extra pressure on an already difficult situation"". Analysts say airlines have been dealt another ""body blow"" by the travel ban. Jacob Schram, chief executive of Norwegian, said this was ""an unprecedented situation"". He called on ""international governments to act now to ensure that the aviation industry can protect jobs and continue to be a vital part of the global economic recovery"". The airline has decided to ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to a quarter of its short-haul flights. The company, which is looking for a cash injection, employs 1,200 people in UK. But all routes between London Gatwick and the US will continue to operate as normal. Economic hit for airlines The airline industry is already facing an economic hit of $113bn (£88bn) from the effects of the outbreak on passenger numbers. Analysts predict this financial loss could grow substantially from the new travel ban. There are fears that some weaker airlines could go bust. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions on 26 European countries in an attempt to combat the spread of coronavirus. The ban applies to travellers from countries that are members of the Schengen border-free travel area. The UK, Ireland and other non-Schengen countries are unaffected. US citizens are also exempt. ""It is another body blow for many airlines in need of central government support in these incredibly difficult times,"" said John Grant from global travel data firm OAG. ""It is just a decision that hurts the industry and the wider economy as travel and trade will be frustrated,"" he said. Many airlines are already under the cosh from the effects of coronavirus, and thousands of flights have been cancelled worldwide. Korean Air has warned that the coronavirus impact could threaten its survival, and UK airline Flybe, which was already struggling, collapsed last week, saying the coronavirus outbreak was partly to blame. 'Cash is king' Airlines around the world are now assessing the impact of Mr Trump's surprise 30-day ban and how it will affect revenues. Analysts predict some airlines could fall into administration. There are nearly 400 daily flights from Europe to the US, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking service. ""In a crisis like this, cash is king,"" said Michael Duff, managing director of The Airline Analyst. He said transatlantic routes tended to be dominated by the major airlines, who should get through the crisis, assuming it lasts three to six months. ""Secondary players and regional and national European carriers are definitely facing severe survivability risk,"" he added. Association of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sarah Nelson called the ban ""irresponsible"". ""There is no explanation for how this will help fight the spread of the virus,"" she said. ""It makes little sense when the virus is already in the US."" ""Without any consultation with the industry, we don't even know what this means,"" she added. The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) urged governments to refrain from introducing travel restrictions. ""Travel restrictions cause significant disruptions to supply chains, commerce, trade and most importantly to peoples' livelihoods due to the severe economic impact,"" said Andrew Herdman, AAPA director general.","Norwegian Air is set to cancel 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off about half of its staff because of the coronavirus outbreak."
"This contributed to an 8% fall in sales, excluding store openings and closures, for the 22 weeks to 1 July. JJB shares closed down 25% at 7.4 pence after the announcement. The company is in the middle of a cost-cutting programme designed to stem losses that totalled £100m last year. Earlier this year, it announced a £30m investment to help drive the business. This included £20m from US retailer Dick's Sporting Goods and £10m from existing shareholders. JJB said that group performance had ""deteriorated"" since the beginning of April. ""Expected peak in sales in connection with sales of replica football kits and associated products generated from consumer interest in the European Football Championships did not materialise to the extent anticipated,"" the company said. ""This sales performance has been further exacerbated by the poor early summer weather. ""Consequently sales have fallen materially short of expectations."" Analysts said the drop in sales was worrying given the number of sporting events taking place. ""Considering that this year is one of the most significant in the sporting calendar for a generation, JJB's numbers are extremely disappointing - all the more so as they demonstrate a marked deterioration in trading since the last update,"" said Neil Saunders from retail analysts Conlumino.",JJB Sports has warned that sales in recent weeks fell below expectations due to weak demand for replica football kits during the European Championships and poor weather.
"She said that raising interest rates would show ""how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis"". Her remarks come after a string of data indicated a strengthening US economy. Many investors are confident the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting on 15 and 16 December. Wall Street stocks dipped following the remarks. Manufacturing data released during her testimony showed factory orders in October rose after two months of decline. New orders were up 1.5%. Ms Yellen recognised that the slowing global economy and a stronger dollar had had an impact on the US, but said consumer and business spending along with housing investment was still strong. On Wednesday, she told a group of economists that she expected the US economy to continue to experience steady growth. The Fed has kept its short-term benchmark interest rate near zero since 2006. Job report The central bank will be paying close attention to Friday's jobs report. The bank has previously said it is watching the labour market and inflation rate closely to determine when to make its increase. ""Ongoing gains in the labour market, coupled with my judgement that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 2%,"" Ms Yellen said. Chair Yellen said a rate of 100,000 new jobs per month would be enough to sustain the labour market. She also indicated that she expected this growth to help raise wages which have been mostly stagnant since the financial crisis. ""I would expect to see some upward pressure on wages - I think we've seen some welcome hints,"" she said. Impact of global terrorism Follow Wednesday's mass shooting in California, Ms Yellen was asked about the impact of these events and global terrorism on the US economy. She said that the central bank had not seen any impact from the recent mass shootings or terrorist attacks, but that ""it does have the potential to have a significant economic effect,"" she said.",US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen has told Congress that the economy is reaching a point where it can handle an interest rate rise.
"According to Russian and Ukrainian media reports Pavel Lerner, 40, was kidnapped while leaving his office in Kiev's Obolon district on 26 December. The reports said he was dragged into a black Mercedes-Benz by men wearing balaclavas. Police in Kiev confirmed to the BBC that a man had been kidnapped on the day in question, but would not confirm his identity. A spokeswoman said that the matter was currently under investigation, and that more information would be made public later on. Mr Lerner is a prominent Russian blockchain expert and the news of his kidnapping has stunned many in the international cryptocurrency community. Exmo described him as an analytics manager. Blockchain is the technology that underpins the digital currency Bitcoin. Exmo Finance is registered with Companies House in the UK, but has its main operations in Ukraine.

"By Richard WestcottBBC Transport Correspondent A committee of six MPs will spend months, maybe even years, hearing from groups and ordinary people whose lives will be impacted by the project. In the end, HS2's fate will be decided in a vote by MPs, but this committee can reshape what will be voted for. It can't stop the scheme, but it might recommend small changes to the route. The committee could also ask for more money be given to the people affected by HS2, and it could argue for extra tunnels to protect land (tunnelling is the most expensive thing of all, so any new digging will add millions to the final bill). It might even force through measures to cut congestion and noise from all those lorries piling to-and-from the HS2 building sites. And when the bill finally clears the House of Commons, the Lords will have a big say too. To give you some context, a similar committee process for the bill on Crossrail - the east-west line that will eventually burrow its way across London - led to a brand new station at Woolwich, despite government opposition. In all, 1,925 different groups and individual people have filed petitions against the government's HS2 bill. Each one gives an insight into how one of the world's biggest construction projects - a scheme that's been tossed around by MPs and argued over by experts - actually affects the people who'll live nearby. From the charity that wants longer tunnels to protect ancient woodlands, to resident Bernice Fuggle, who among other things is worried that construction lorries and extra cars will make cycling in and around Little Kingshill more dangerous. Then there's Alexandra Swan who says the bill in its current form ""will jeopardise the health, safety and well-being"" of her family, and John Jeremy Cameron, who is concerned that extra traffic will potentially stop the emergency services getting to his family in a reasonable time (he suggests that HS2 Ltd provide an air ambulance during working hours). And the Friends of Wormwood Scrubs Park Association whose 3,000 supporters include everyone from dog walkers to kiteboarders and model aircraft flyers. They're angry at plans to turn some of their park, currently used for sport and recreation, into a wetland habitat, to compensate for damage to the environment elsewhere en-route. Unsurprisingly, it's the years of lorries and cement mixers trundling past their homes that worries many people. The impact of all that traffic and dust on their journeys to work and school, and on their health or value of their house, is of concern. There's another interesting comparison to make with the Crossrail parliamentary bill. That bill received a mere 365 petitions, with a further 99 coming later on. And it still took nearly four years to go through parliament. That's why many MPs I've spoken to scoff at the government's original ambition to get HS2 through by next summer. The new boss of the project, Sir David Higgins, has made it very clear to MPs that the best way to keep costs down is to hustle the parliamentary process along as quickly as possible. But he's also told me in the past that scrutiny is vital if HS2 is going to be credible with the public.",The long process of scrutinising nearly two thousand objections to the government's High Speed Two (HS2) rail bill has begun.
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter The major supermarkets are fighting the German discount chains for business and price is their chosen battleground. Tesco launched its Aldi price-match in March 2020 and extended it to around 500 products in September. Sainsbury's - the UK's second-largest supermarket - has now joined the fray, saying: ""It will help shoppers who are working hard to balance budgets"". It has promised to slash the cost of hundreds of essential groceries to match Aldi. Prices will be cut on 250 popular items including meat, chicken, fresh fruit and vegetables and dairy. The price match is the first part of chief executive Simon Roberts' plan announced in November to put food back at the heart of the business. ""We are making great progress delivering our Food First plan and I'm determined that in these tough times, we do even more to help our customers save money,"" he said. Squeezed margins The grocery chains are under political pressure with rumours circulating that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a levy on them for making ""excess profits"" during the pandemic. But while people are buying more food to eat at home, the supermarkets say they are making less money. Mr Roberts has said that that the pandemic has led to customers switching from its most profitable channel - convenience stores - to its least profitable - online shopping. Supermarkets make less money out of online shopping because of delivery and higher staffing costs. The latest price-war will hit profit margins already squeezed to between 2-4%. But on the other hand, the move to online has benefited the traditional supermarkets as Aldi's smaller online offering has left it unable to take advantage of the booming demand for home deliveries. In fact Aldi has seen its sales growth fall behind some of its rivals during the pandemic. Figures from retail analysts Kantar for the 12 weeks to 24 January 24 revealed that Aldi sales grew by just 5.7% compared with 12.2% growth across the UK grocery market as a whole. Price cuts The price war has seen rival supermarkets set up their own discounts and deals to try and attract customers through their doors or onto their online sites. As well as its Aldi Price Match, Tesco offers savings through its Club Card Prices and said: ""We know that our customers want competitive prices for the products and brands they buy regularly."" Aldi pointed out that ""Consumer group Which? recently found that Sainsbury's were over 31% more expensive than Aldi"". An Aldi spokesperson said: ""Shoppers know that the only place you can get Aldi prices is at Aldi."" Lidl, contrarily, avoids price drop campaigns in favour of low prices, although it does have a Pick of the Week special offer. It was awarded the title of cheapest supermarket in 2020 by Which?",The supermarket price-war has edged up a notch after Sainsbury's followed Tesco's Aldi price-match scheme.
"By Rebecca MarstonBusiness reporter, BBC News For the first time, young people in the UK aged between 16 to 24 are spending slightly less time on their smart devices, according to a report. Market researcher Kantar TNS found that those within that group now spent an average of 3.8 hours on their phones a day down from 3.9 hours last year. And this may be a surprise to parents, but a third of those said they thought they spent too much time on their phones and wanted to cut down. That of course leaves the other two thirds. June King, who is 24 years old, says she has not cut down her usage: ""It's part of my life, I just use it all the time. I think I'm on it for 12 hours a day! ""The only thing that worries me is electro-magnetic waves at night. So I try to keep it away from me while I sleep."" The group with the biggest growth in smartphone use are pensioners, according to the research. Kantar TNS said the amount of time the older generation in the UK spent on their phones had rocketed between this year and last year, from 36 minutes to 54 minutes a day globally. The average use across all generations is 2.4 hours a day. Ann Morseby, who is in her 60s, says her usage remains fairly modest, about 40 minutes a day, but it is creeping up. ""I check my emails more frequently, although I still mostly use it for texting. I have started playing games more on it, though, so perhaps those 40 minutes are actually more like an hour,"" she says. Can't live The slight fall in smartphone use among the young in the UK does not mean the appetite for connectivity is still anything less than voracious. The vast majority of under-24s - 94% - have a smartphone, and one device is often not enough. Some 40% of 16 to 24 year-olds use multiple devices at the same time when they're online. Kantar's research found that over half of 16 to 24 year-olds (52%) don't think they could live without social media and 84% use social media on a daily basis - up from 75% in 2015.",Are we seeing the start of peak phone?
"Pre-tax profits fell to £344m for the half-year to 4 August, compared to £440m in the same period last year. The ""economic backdrop remains difficult for the consumer"", said chief executive Dalton Philips. Morrisons is to offer online shopping from the end of January 2014 after finalising an agreement with Ocado. ""Whilst early indications of a recovery in the UK economy are encouraging, we are yet to see this impact on consumers' pockets"", the company said. Total turnover for the period remained the steady at £8.9bn, the same as last year, but like-for-like sales - which strip out the effect of new store openings - fell 1.6%. Morrisons' share price ended the day up 1.7% after the company said it expected an improvement in second-half sales performance. Online shopping Some retail analysts believe Morrisons has struggled to keep up with its rivals - Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's - because of its lack of online shopping facility and its slowness in rolling out smaller convenience stores. The company believes its £216m partnership agreement with Ocado, which also operates Waitrose's online shopping facility, will help it catch up, after writing off £27m trying to develop its own online business. Morrisons said its was ""on track"" to have 100 convenience stores operating this year. Its investment in online shopping and convenience stores will ""increase our accessible market by around 40%"", the company said. The popularity of online shopping was reflected in Ocado's own quarterly results released today. Its gross sales rose 16.4% to £189.2m for the 12 weeks to 11 August, compared to the same period in 2012, while the average number of weekly orders rose 15.3% to 138,889.","Morrisons, the UK's fourth largest supermarket chain, has reported a fall in half-year profits, citing ""challenging"" market conditions."
"The company paid £390m for Ignis and says the deal will mean its assets under management will increase by more than 30% to £240bn. The move will accelerate Standard Life Investments' move away from insurance to managing funds for outside clients. Parent company Standard Life shares jumped nearly 7% following the news. It means the company's stock market value rose by more than £550m, comfortably exceeding the price it paid for Ignis. The purchase means Standard Life Investments will become one of the UK's biggest investment managers with 81% of its revenues coming from fund management. Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Standard Life Investments, said: ""This acquisition is entirely complementary, deepening our investment capabilities, broadening our third party client base and strengthening our strategic position"" He said that the acquisition would mean some job losses, but create annual savings of £50m after three years.","Standard Life Investments, the Edinburgh-based pensions and insurance firm, has bought Ignis Asset Management from life assurer Phoenix Group."
"The firm, best known for the invention of the bag-less vacuum cleaner, said the pandemic was changing consumer habits as more people shopped online. Dyson was founded by inventor Sir James Dyson, who in May topped the Sunday Times Rich List. The company has a global workforce of 14,000, with 4,000 in the UK. Most of the jobs will be lost in retail and customer service roles. Dyson uses its own people to sell in department stores, for example at John Lewis, but the shift to online has cut necessity for a High Street presence. The jobs being lost overseas, where the company operates in 80 countries, involve similar roles. A Dyson spokesman said: ""The Covid-19 crisis has accelerated changes in consumer behaviour and therefore requires changes in how we engage with our customers and how we sell our products."" He said the company would try to avoid compulsory redundancies where possible, and emphasised that it had not furloughed any staff nor drawn on any public money to support jobs anywhere in the world during the pandemic. Most Dyson products are designed in the UK, where it has two technology campuses in Wiltshire, but manufactured in Asia. Electric cars Earlier this year the company joined the fight to produce medical ventilators for the NHS, amid fears it would be overwhelmed by coronavirus. In March the government ordered 10,000 ventilators from the company, although Sir James later told employees these were no longer needed. The company also tried to diversify into making electric cars. But last year, it said that although its engineers in the UK had developed a ""fantastic electric car"", it would not hit the roads because it was not ""commercially viable"". Sir James, a Brexit-backing entrepreneur, launched his first vacuum cleaner in 1993. He had previously, in 1974, invented a wheelbarrow which used a spherical wheel.",Dyson is cutting 600 jobs in the UK and a further 300 worldwide as the coronavirus impact speeds up the company's restructuring plans.
"The UK inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose from 0.3% in May, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the rise to higher air fares, fuel and consumer spending. Much of that was the result of European air travel, possibly connected to the Euro 2016 football tournament, it said. The inflation figures are based on data collected before the EU referendum vote on 23 June. The cost of flights jumped by a record 10.9% between May and June, ONS statistician Phil Gooding said. What is CPI? ""The growing cost of oil, feeding through to petrol prices, also helped to nudge up CPI,"" he added. City analysts expect inflation to rise sharply in the coming months as the fall in the pound relative to other currencies following the Brexit vote makes goods imported into the UK more expensive. The 0.5% annual increase in CPI matches that in March this year. It was last higher in November 2014. But this measurement of the cost of living has remained well below the Bank of England's 2% target for more than two years. 5% inflation? The weaker pound has also raised expectations that the Bank of England will look to cut interest rates in August to combat a possible slowdown in economic growth, as increased costs feed into the wider economy and impact on consumer spending and confidence. The Bank will release its quarterly inflation forecasts next month, which are expected to include an analysis of the impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU. But the cut in interest rates could be short-lived, as some economists have forecast inflation could peak as high as 5% next year. That might force the Bank to raise interest rates sharply in order to bring inflation back under control. Earlier this month Bank of England governor Mark Carney, giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, warned that homeowners should be prepared for a 3% rise in interest rates. Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said the rise in inflation was ""likely to be the start of a rising trend in prices as costs march higher in response to the recent slump in sterling."" He added inflation was likely to rise further in coming months as the impact of sterling's depreciation feeds through, ""breaching the Bank of England 2% target next year, possibly by some margin"". However, policymakers are expected to 'look through' any rise in inflation caused by the Brexit-related slump in the pound, focusing instead on the job of shoring up economic growth, he said.",The average cost of everyday household goods and services went up by 0.5% in the year to June.
"The number out of work in the UK fell by 97,000 to 1.86 million in the three months to December. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.7% of the working population, the Office for National Statistics said. Average earnings including bonuses rose 2.1% in the quarter from a year earlier. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose 1.7%. The ONS also said total pay was 2.4% higher in December compared with the same month in 2013 - the biggest lead over inflation since March 2010. CPI inflation was 0.5% in December, and new data released on Tuesday showed the rate fell to 0.3% in January, its lowest level since records began. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors (IoD), said wages would continue to rise as competition for talent intensified. ""Two-thirds of IoD members [are] planning pay rises at least in line with inflation over the coming months,"" he added. Self-employment falls The ONS said the employment rate, or level of people in work, for those aged between 16 and 64 was 73.2% for the three months to December - a joint record high. The employment rate last reached 73.2% in the December 2004 to February 2005 period, and has not been higher since comparable records began in 1971. That meant 30.9 million people were in work in the final three months of 2014 - 608,000 more than in the same three months a year earlier. Over the quarter, the number of self-employed fell 19,000 to 4.4 million. Long-term unemployment also fell, by 210,000 among those out of work for more than a year, to 638,000. However, for the October to December period, the unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds was 16.2%, which was unchanged on the previous quarter. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the failure of youth unemployment to fall further was a concern: ""It is consistently higher than the adult employment rate, so we need to look at ways to bring this down further."" The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell 38,600 in January to 823,000, the 27th straight monthly fall. Pound jumps The strong labour market and pay figures boosted the value of the pound against other currencies. Sterling jumped 1.1% against the euro to €1.36 and added 0.5% against the dollar to $1.5431. The pound was also lifted by the latest minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which showed signs of divisions between the Bank's policymakers. Although all nine members of the MPC voted to keep interest rates at 0.5%, two members said the decision was ""finely balanced"", adding: ""Given the outlook for inflation beyond the short term, there could well be a case for an increase in Bank Rate later in the year."" The two members were not named, but Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale both voted for rate rises on several occasions last year. However, the minutes also said that for another MPC member, ""the next change in the stance of monetary policy was roughly as likely to be a loosening as a tightening"". Regional picture The ONS said the unemployment rate was highest in the North East at 8%, with 103,000 people out of work - down 15,000 on the previous quarter. The rate was lowest in the South West at 4.5%, where the number of unemployed fell by 7,000 to 122,000. London had the highest number of people out of work at 295,000, up 7,000 to 6.4%. Of the regions, the unemployment rate was highest in Wales at 6.7%, with Northern Ireland on 5.7% and Scotland at 5.4% - lower than the national rate. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ""The jobs-led recovery is changing people's lives for the better on a daily basis."" Labour's shadow employment minister Stephen Timms said the fall in overall unemployment was welcome, ""but five years of the Tories' failing plan has left working people £1,600 a year worse off since 2010"".","Unemployment has continued to fall in Britain, while wage growth outpaced inflation at the fastest rate in almost five years."
"The cost is 20% higher than four years ago, according to the report commissioned by financial services company Sun Life Direct. The cost of funerals was key to the increase, it said, The research comes as the cost of living, measured by inflation, rose in August. The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rose to 4.5% from 4.4% in July, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure increased to 5.2% from 5%. 'Concern' The Sun Life Direct report suggested that the costs related to death were expected to keep rising. ""Currently the number of deaths each year in England and Wales is at an all-time low, with 491,348 deaths registered in 2009,"" said Kate Woodthorpe, lecturer in sociology at the University of Bath, who co-authored the report. ""It is anticipated, however, that the number of deaths will rise significantly and by 2030, there will be an additional 80,000 people dying a year. ""This equates to a rise of 17% in the death rate in less than 20 years."" The report suggested that the average cost of a cremation in the UK was £2,720 and a burial was £3,462. Administration of the estate cost £2,292, it said, and other costs included catering for the funeral at £319 and flowers at £144. However, the Church of England's law-making body, the General Synod, recently rejected a proposal to increase the price of funerals in Anglican churches from £102 to £150.","The costs related to death, such as a funeral and a headstone, have collectively risen by £400 in a year to £7,248, a report says."
"Ministers had been facing a parliamentary defeat, with several Tory MPs joining opposition politicians to table amendments to the finance bill. The chancellor said in the Budget the maximum bet would be reduced from £100 to £2 from October. But that led to accusations of a delay - with sports minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest. Several former ministers - including Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Justine Greening - tabled amendments designed to force the government to make the change from April. Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button. What has the government done? Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The government has listened and will now implement the reduction in April 2019."" Mr Wright added that a planned increase in Remote Gaming Duty, paid by online gaming firms, would be brought forward to April to cover the negative impact on the public finances. Ms Crouch said she welcomed the decision and was pleased that ""common sense"" had prevailed. Asked if she would like to return to Government, Ms Crouch said: ""There isn't a vacancy. That's been filled. So, I will just get on and do what I'm going to do."" The government had earlier said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe. What happened earlier today? Theresa May had earlier been asked at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday about the timing by Conservative ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith. He said: ""I was enormously proud of my government for agreeing to lower the stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to £2 because they have caused endless harm, terrible damage to families and it was the right decision. ""Since then, there has been a hiatus about the date at which this would start."" Mrs May answered: ""I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. I know gambling addiction can devastate lives."" How important are FOBTs to bookmakers? By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check FOBTs were introduced into betting shops in 1999. Since then, the number has grown to 33,468 in Great Britain. Data from the Gambling Commission shows that the profit generated by FOBTs grew from £1.05bn in 2009 to £1.83bn last year - that's a rise of 74%. Last year, betting shops made £3.2bn from a combination of FOBTs and traditional ""over-the-counter"" bets. As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09. That suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit. Why has the government been looking at this issue? FOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm. The machines have been called the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems. The government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players. How has the market reacted? Investors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%. After the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said. What has been the political reaction? Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken ""the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals"". He added it was ""a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction"".",The maximum bet on fixed-odds betting terminals will be cut from April after the government bowed to pressure.
"By Andrew WalkerBusiness Daily, BBC World Service Now it is more than half of a much larger population. At the same time, the size of the biggest cities has climbed. There is even a word for the very biggest, the megacity, sometimes defined as an urban area with a population of more than ten million. There are a few in rich nations, including Tokyo, (with more than thirty million people), New York, Los Angeles and London. But most are in emerging and developing countries, especially in Asia. Several have populations of well over twenty million and they certainly have their challenges. A city out of control - that is the image that some of the vast conurbations of the developing world have acquired, says Saskia Sassen, Professor of Sociology at Columbia University in New York. But it's probably not the reality she says. That is not because of governments, but the result of the hard work of the residents. She told the BBC: ""They make an economy, they make their housing, and they make an informal governance system"". For example, Biola Ajaga, a single mother in Nigeria's megacity, Lagos, told the BBC that where she lives everyone pays a fee to a vigilante group to keep the peace. Better life Which raises the question, if the basics aren't there, why on earth do these giant cities continue to act as a magnet for such vast numbers of people? Prof Sassen gives three main reasons. First, the desperate situation of many people in rural areas, who move to cities in the hope of a better life. Then she says there is the fact that 220 million hectares of land have been bought by foreign buyers in the last five years - foreign governments and businesses. She says many people are evicted as result. And then there is desertification. There are whole areas of India for example where the ground water has gone, she says, places where if you have a well it will not give you water. But there are some factors that discourage people, such as when a city becomes so big so that you can't live anywhere near where the jobs are. She says that Sao Paulo in Brazil and Mexico City have not grown as large as some expected. That kind of balancing mechanism might be the reason. Megacities on such a vast scale are a modern phenomenon. But the ancient world had its big cities with real challenges, and some of them that sound every bit as difficult as their modern equivalents. Dr Armand D'Angour, who teaches classics at Oxford University, describes the satirist Juvenal writing about Rome two thousand years ago, as a place of constant noise and traffic, with garbage and sewage thrown into the street and dangers of violence and sudden death. Babylon in what is now Iraq had a problem that is harder to imagine being repeated today. Dr D'Angour says that ""the sheer extent of the city's territory had left some regions unaware of enemy incursion for three days, thus preventing the Babylonians from successfully defending themselves against the invaders"". You can hear more on this in the BBC World Service Radio programme Business Daily.","One of the most striking developments of the last century has been the growth of cities. A hundred years ago, 20% of us lived in cities."
"Data from the British Retail Consortium showed that like-for-like sales fell 1% compared to the same month last year. February's fall comes after a 3.9% like-for-like increase in January, and marks the first drop since April. Online sales did better, with non-food sales figures growing 14.3% year-on-year. ""February saw a hiatus on the high street, with online sales soaring while in-store sales stalled,"" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG. ""There's no doubt inclement weather exacerbated this trend, but it certainly underscores the importance of having a sophisticated online operation."" Online sales represented 17.5% of total non-food sales, against 15.4% in February 2013, according to the figures, compiled by the BRC and KPMG. Fiercely competitive campaigns by discount grocers saw a slowdown in food price inflation. But the recovery in the housing market had a positive effect on sales of furniture and home accessories. Helen Dickinson, director at the BRC, said: ""Overall, these figures reflect the considerable challenges still faced by consumers and retailers in the UK. It remains to be seen how the industry will fare over 2014.""",UK retail sales in February fell for the first time in almost a year as bad weather put a dampener on High Street spending.
"By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News, Venice The protest formed quickly and without warning - a flash mob, designed to call urgent attention to the 6,000 Venetians who rely on the cruise industry for work. After 15 minutes they are gone. This year, international travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus are forcing cruise companies to delay most tours until 2021. That's meant the ships that usually tower high above Venice's historic bell towers and basilicas have been noticeably absent. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the change. They've been calling for cruise ships to be banned from Venice for years because of concerns about pollution and continual damage to the fragile foundations of the city. Traditionally known as La Serenissima, Venice is no longer ""'the most serene"" but rather one of the most polluted ports in Europe, according to the green campaign group Transport and Environment. Supporters of the cruise industry say the Italian government in Rome must now come up with a long-term plan - such as a new cruise terminal, outside the Venice lagoon - that will protect the city, but also guarantee the ships' future in the area. Antonio Valecca is a porter with the baggage company Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia, which has been transporting tourists' luggage from ships to Venice's hotels for the past 80 years. ""When the coronavirus is finished, we need to bring the cruise ships back to Venice,"" he says. ""This is the moment for the government to make a decision."" Because of the continuing debate, the world's second-largest cruise firm, Royal Caribbean, has already announced that next summer, its cruise liners won't be calling at Venice. Instead, they will be docking at Ravenna, 150km (90 miles) to the south. Passengers who want to visit Venice will be taken there on buses. The protesters say other cruise ships could be permanently diverted to ports at Genoa or Trieste. ""We're really worried about that,"" Mr Valecca says. Baggage handler Vladimiro Tommasini who led the recent protest says the workers he represents are tired of waiting for the government to act. ""We are here today to protest because we've been waiting eight years for a solution regarding the passage of cruise ships in Venice,"" he says. ""We ask that cruise tourism has to be compatible with the structure of our city and the lagoon. We now ask for answers from the government."" Eight years ago, 33 people died when an Italian cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, capsized and sank off the coast of Tuscany after hitting an underwater reef. The accident prompted the Italian authorities to introduce a law banning the largest cruise liners from Venice - those over 96,000 tonnes. Smaller vessels were limited to five ships per day. But the law was thrown out soon after at appeal. Matters came to a head again last summer, when the 60,000-tonne MSC Opera lost control and crashed into a dock and a tourist boat in Venice, injuring two passengers. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows the ship's horn blaring as bystanders dwarfed by the 13-deck vessel shout ""Get back!"" and run from the incoming hull. But despite mounting pressure, city authorities and the national government in Rome have failed to come up with a plan for the ships' future, and Venice remains divided. Opponents of the cruise industry say the pandemic has shown what the future could look like, if the cruise liners were banned for good. On the same day as the port workers' protest on the train station steps, a climate camp is being held in a disused industrial site in Marghera, about 20 minutes' drive across the bridge from Venice. Banners calling for an end to fossil fuels have been hung on the walls of a large warehouse where young people are listening to speakers making rallying calls for climate justice. Flags painted with ""no grandi navi"" (no big ships) fly outside the camp. Environmental activist Sofia Demasi is part of the No Grandi Navi committee and the international climate movement, Fridays For Future. ""Big cruise ships create a lot of pollution, a lot of problems for a city that should not be an example of the climate crisis, but of the fight against the crisis,"" she says. No Grandi Navi leader Tommaso Cacciari says that as well as the pollution, the ships are damaging the city's foundations, by creating underwater waves that cause erosion. ""The stones of Venice are not concrete, they are not kept together by cement. It's kept together by mud and sand, materials that are very mobile,"" he says. ""And so it causes erosion of the structure of the city. And that's a big problem."" But the environmentalists face a tough campaign against a cruise industry with powerful political allies. Italy is home to one of the world's largest shipbuilding firms, Fincantieri. Last month, the company delivered the latest member of its fleet - a 145,000 tonne mega-ship called the Enchanted Princess, ordered by the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise firm. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sent his congratulations in a video message. Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald joined the ceremony by video link from Florida. ""We are facing extremely challenging times within our industry,"" he told the socially-distanced crowd at Fincantieri's Monfalcone shipyard. ""We thank you prime minister and your government for your ongoing support."" Mr Donald said Carnival Corporation had been one of the largest foreign investors in the Italian economy, pointing to the €30bn ($35bn; £27bn) that Carnival has spent on Fincantieri ships over the past 30 years. ""Gathering here today helps us to focus on the joy that sailing the oceans brings to millions of guests each year,"" he said. ""It also reminds us of the vast numbers of people whose careers and livelihoods depend on the maritime industry."" It is not yet clear who will win the argument over the future of cruise ships in Venice, but the pressure is mounting on the authorities to reach a decision. This year, visitors who do make it to Venice have the chance to see the city as it was, before the cruise ships came. ""If you walk near the canals now, you can see what the difference is. Without cruise ships, Venice is a different place and we're happy,"" says Sofia Demasi. Additional reporting by Vera Mantengoli","""Work! Work! Work!"" shout the baggage handlers, ship cleaners and port security guards protesting on the steps of Venice's Santa Lucia train station."
"By Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News Self-driving cars already exist and there will be more of them in future, but the chances are that you won't be driven by one any time soon. You may, however, already be using a car that can steer, brake or park by itself. The fear is that the hype around driverless cars has led some drivers to test the limits of existing technology in ways that are downright reckless. A Tesla driver in the UK, for example, was recently prosecuted for climbing into the passenger seat of his car while it was moving at around 40mph (64km/h) in motorway traffic. He was using Tesla's Autopilot, a system that does allow the car to accelerate, brake and steer by itself on major roads, but is not designed to completely replace a driver. Other manufacturers such as Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac have similar mechanisms. But none of them is designed to be fully autonomous. Hands on the wheel Using standard criteria established by the US engineering organisation SAE International, cars can be placed into six broad categories depending on the level of automation they contain. They range from Level Zero, where the vehicle is not automated at all, to Level 5, which means it can drive itself on all roads and in all conditions, making the human behind the wheel - and the steering wheel itself - redundant. Current ""driver assistance"" systems are Level 2 in the jargon, and the driver is meant to keep his or her hands firmly on the wheel. But getting that message across has clearly been a challenge. Tesla's Autopilot in particular has been implicated in a number of high profile crashes, two of them fatal. The company denies claims that the Autopilot name itself encourages drivers to hand over control, and has rejected demands from the German government to stop using the term. It says feedback from its customers has shown that ""they have a very clear understanding of what Autopilot is, how to properly use it and what features it consists of"". Nevertheless, since 2016 Tesla's systems have included more prominent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, and have been able to lock them out of Autopilot if they fail to do so. That same year, Mercedes faced criticism over advertising that suggested its E-Class was a ""self-driving car"". It later withdrew the adverts, in response, it said, to claims that customers could find them confusing. Eliminating humans Although ride-sharing firms like Lyft and Uber have been working hard on developing fully autonomous technology - as have many mainstream manufacturers - Level 5 cars are still some way off. Waymo appears to be closer than most. Later this year Google's sister company is planning to introduce a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Unlike several other autonomous taxi services being trialled around the world, this one will not need a safety driver in the car. But the service will only operate in a relatively small ""geo-fenced"" area of Phoenix that the company has intensively mapped. It is still, in effect, a test-bed. There is a big step between this kind of limited service and something that can safely negotiate a densely populated mega-city in all weathers. Test drive ""Testing and development is different from bringing onto the market,"" explains Prof Walter Brenner of the University of St Gallen in Switzerland and co-author of Autonomous driving - how the driverless revolution will change the world. ""They are completely different worlds. The tests are useful because they show both the strengths and the limits of this technology, but they are just tests."" Earlier this year, a woman was killed in Arizona by an Uber test car being driven in autonomous mode. It failed to stop when she moved into its path. Clearly, despite all the research being carried out and the money being spent, there is still a lot of work to do before full autonomy becomes a safe, everyday reality. Responsibility Safety experts believe car companies need to take more responsibility for ensuring consumers don't make mistakes. ""Calling this kind of technology Autopilot… that's very misleading for consumers,"" says Matthew Avery of Thatcham Research - a group that tests vehicles on behalf of the UK insurance industry. ""They might think 'I just need to push this button and I can let the car drive'."" More Technology of Business He also thinks manufacturers should take further steps to ensure the technology isn't abused, such as having cameras monitoring the driver. But he remains convinced that automation itself has vital safety benefits. There is already evidence that automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection systems are reducing the number of accidents. But more sophisticated systems can take that process a step further. ""What the best systems are doing is integrating lane control, stopping people veering out of their lane, with braking control and distance control. ""That can really help keep people out of trouble,"" he says. 'Harsh punishments' Walter Brenner believes there's a need for drivers - and people selling cars - to be better educated about what semi-automated systems can do. There is a risk, he concedes, that even with that knowledge some people might deliberately choose to let the technology do more than it should - to experiment with it, or even to show off. In those cases, he thinks, punishments should be harsh. ""There's a big difference between trying out a new feature on an iPhone and playing with technology in a car when you're travelling at 100km/h (62mph) on a public road,"" he says. ""Those people have to be punished because they're risking other people's lives.""",The confusion between fully autonomous self-driving cars and those that simply offer driver assistance technologies is leading to deaths on the road. Who is to blame and what should be done about it?
"By Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News The current finance director, Clotilde Delbos, has been appointed to run the business on an interim basis. Renault's move comes close on the heels of the decision by its industrial partner Nissan to appoint a new chief executive earlier this week. Mr Bolloré has described the manoeuvering against him as a ""strong-arm coup"". Intense infighting As corporate bloodlettings go, this was brutal and ruthless. Mr Bolloré told a French newspaper that he only became aware of attempts to get rid of him when he stepped off a plane in Paris in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Renault chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard was behind the move and appears to have had the endorsement of the French government, a 15% shareholder in Renault. So what happened? Mr Bolloré was appointed in January, in the wake of a major scandal involving his predecessor, Carlos Ghosn. Mr Ghosn, who was also chairman of Nissan and presided over the global alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, was arrested in Tokyo last year. He remains in custody on charges of financial wrongdoing, which he denies. He claims he was a victim of a plot orchestrated by Nissan executives, who were anxious to prevent a merger between the company and its French partner. The fallout from his arrest has been severe, triggering a period of intense infighting within the Nissan boardroom and poisoning the relationship with Renault. Since then, both companies have seen a steep fall in profits, while Nissan has been further tainted by financial scandal. Earlier this week, Nissan appointed a new chief executive, Makoto Ushida, in an effort to stop the rot, get the company back on track and smooth ruffled feathers at Renault. The removal of Mr Bolloré - once a close associate of Carlos Ghosn - may also have been intended, at least in part, to heal the rift between the two companies, although it is understood the the poor performance of the business itself was a major factor. So where does all this leave the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, collectively one of the world's biggest car manufacturing groups? The links between them are strong - Renault has a 43% shareholding in the Japanese firm, their logistics networks are heavily intertwined, and they share a range of technology. Unwinding all that would not be easy. But insiders say the damage done by the upheaval of the past year runs deep within the fabric of both businesses. So keeping them together, and restoring a cordial relationship may not be easy.","French car manufacturer Renault has dismissed its chief executive, Thierry Bolloré, with immediate effect."
"Simon JackBusiness editor@BBCSimonJackon Twitter There was no agreement from 2008 onwards between the company and the trustees about the correct level of contribution over that decade and according to Robin Ellison, the chair of the trustees, there was precious little the guardians of the pension could do about it. In fact, the bigger the deficit and the worse the company's fortunes, the more powerless the trustees felt. Towards the end, they said they were prepared to give the company a pension contribution holiday to help alleviate the company's dire cash flow problem and convince the banks to throw Carillion a final lifeline. In the end, it was academic as the government's refusal to support the company brought about Carillion's collapse anyway. Carillion collapse sparks 'big four' probe Carillion 'wriggled out' of obligations There are many facets to Carillion's collapse but the aspect in focus today before the joint Business and Pension committees in the commons was the balance between the ongoing interests of the company and the interests of past employees. Robin Ellison put his finger on it when he said: ""We have a dilemma. In one way we want as much money as we can. On the other hand, we don't want to destroy the company and getting that balance right is a challenge."" That balance was wrong, according to advice the trustees paid for themselves. In 2012, outside advisers said Carillion had prioritised growing earnings and supporting the share price ahead of the pension scheme. The trustees were advised in writing that Carillion could ""comfortably afford to make higher contributions"". When you are paying for advice you often get what you want to hear - and this was certainly music to the pension trustees' ear. What is surprising is that the trustees could not use this report as a way of recruiting the Pensions Regulator, which does have the power to force companies to pay more, in their campaign for higher contributions. The head of the Pensions regulator, Lesley Titcomb, should get her tin hat on before she makes her appearance before MPs. The Work and Pensions select committee chair, Frank Field has already described a written response to these questions as ""tentative and apologetic"". The other thing we learnt today is that this post mortem will not be quick. Sarah Albon, the head of the Insolvency Service which examines the circumstances in which companies go bust said investigations usually take 21 months but this one could take longer thanks to the ""incredibly poor standard of record keeping at the company"". Déjà vu There is already a sense of déjà vu about these proceedings. As with the BHS inquiry, all of today's witnesses - the chair of the trustees, the Insolvency Service and the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council claim one thing in common. Their area of responsibility was limited and their ability to influence the people running the company before it collapsed was negligible. Those former bosses appear before MPs a week today which is when we can expect the heat on the grill to be really cranked up. For 10 years, the Carillion pension trustees tried to get the company to pay in more money to the scheme without success.","For 10 years, the Carillion pension trustees tried to get the company to pay in more money to the scheme without success."
"Robert PestonEconomics editor In order to assess the important question of whether the big contractors, Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita, are making excessive profits from their £4bn of annual business with the public sector, the government's spending watchdog had to rely to a great extent on information volunteered to them by the four. Which seems something of a lacuna, given that a huge and rising proportion of our public services are delivered by the private sector. According to the NAO, contracting out, to the likes of Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita, accounts for ""around half of the £187bn that the public sector spends on goods and services each year"". Or to put it another way, contracting out represents around 15% of all public spending and 5% of UK GDP. Private sector delivery of public services is therefore hugely important to the effectiveness of the functioning of the state and to the productivity of the economy. Yet it is only written in to some contracts that they are ""open book"", that the client (that's you by the way, the taxpayer) has a formal right to know how much money the private company is actually making from a particular contract. So what did the NAO actually learn about the profitability of the big four outsourcing companies from the information they supplied? Well the big four say that in 2012 their respective operating margins - the profits they typically make as a percentage of sales - on government contracts were lower than the operating margin they earn on average on all contracts. So on that basis, if the numbers are reliable, it would be hard to argue that the government is being ripped off. But there are three qualifications to make: 1. They are all making an operating margin on government work in the ballpark of 5%, with Capita and Serco apparently generating a smidge more than Atos and G4S. But is there anything magical and appropriate about that 5% number? Now the NAO points out that the net margin for these companies for all their work - for public-sector and private-sector work - is a bit less than the average for FTSE 100 companies. But that may not be a useful comparison. Given the long term nature of the public-sector contracts, and that once they are won they are frequently rolled over and extended, would it be reasonable for the profit margin to be even less? The NAO doesn't seem to have a view on this. 2. There is enormous variation in the profitability of different contracts, which calls into question whether the 5% average return is meaningful. The gross profit margin (the profit before allocating overheads) for Atos on contracts varies between 3% and 22%, the range is 6-18% for Capita, it's 0-32% for G4S, and 4-13% for Serco. Again an important question is begged, namely why there is such variation in the profitability of contracts both for individual companies and between companies? Does this variation reflect the different degrees of risk for the contractor in each contract - which would be a reassuring explanation? Or does it imply that there is great variation in the competence of public sector negotiators - which would warm the cockles rather less? Again there is no definitive answer from the NAO. 3. The NAO notes that from 1 January 2006 to 30 September 2013, the value of these businesses on the stock market has risen much more than the value of FTSE 100 companies in general. In that period, the FTSE 100 index increased 26%, whereas Capita's share price rose 141% and G4S's 94%. That would suggest investors aren't remotely worried that the profitability of government contracts is too slim. Quite the reverse. It implies that the reliability of the revenues from these contracts is what matters, and that therefore the profit margins are quite satisfactory. But, and this is quite important, the story of the relationship between the private-sector providers and the government is - ahem - evolving. Since the 2010 general election, the Cabinet Office has aggressively tried to exercise greater central control over the awarding of outsourcing contracts. In the process, it has obtain substantial refunds on older deals and seems to be securing better value for money on new transactions. More recently the Ministry of Justice has duffed up Serco and G4S, by calling in the Serious Fraud Office to investigate alleged overcharging for electronic tagging of criminals. Or to put it another way, the perceived balance between risk and reward on these outsourced deals is changing, to the detriment of the private sector businesses. There have been big management changes at Serco and G4S, and their share prices have both fallen by around a sixth since May. So probably the most interesting conclusion by the NAO is the one that goes against the grain of typical political and public discourse about private sector providers. The NAO warns the Cabinet Office that there is a limit to the financial squeeze it can put on the likes of the big four, and that it may not be too long before there will be a loss of ""innovation and investment"" which ""could pose a risk to value for money in the longer term"". The watchdog takes seriously the private sector providers when they say they may choose not to bid for future contracts in certain public services. And that could be a problem, because - with so much outsourced since the 1980s - it is not obvious that the public sector retains the competence and skills to take back some of these services. Or to return to where I started, given that public and private sectors are now so intimately and intricately combined, it may not be unreasonable for the taxpayer as employer to have much clearer sight of how much profit the contractor is earning.",Possibly the most shocking disclosure in the National Audit Office's two reviews of how private sector companies deliver public services is how little financial information the NAO can actually demand to scrutinise.
"The Competition and Markets Authority is concerned that rather than helping consumers, the sites might actually be making it more difficult for them. The CMA said it was ""concerned about the clarity, accuracy and presentation of information on sites"". The investigation will examine areas such as hidden charges, search results, and discount claims. Leading booking sites include Expedia and Booking.com. In a statement, booking site Trivago, which is majority owned by Expedia, said: ""Trivago will work with the CMA to explain the benefits it delivers to consumers looking for their ideal hotel."" Booking.com said it would not be commenting at this time. According to the CMA, about 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites. Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We are concerned about the clarity and accuracy of these sites. Rather than helping consumers they may actually be making it more difficult for them."" She explained that the suggestions offered by such sites were not ranked solely on the preferences entered by the user. ""When you put in your criteria - which room you want, when you want to stay - they are listed in a certain order. This is not just influenced by consumer preference but by commission - commercial considerations - and consumers might not be aware of this."" The British Hospitality Association (BHA) said it welcomed the probe as many of its members were concerned about the ""vast power"" of online booking agencies. It highlighted ""high rates of commission, use of misleading information, pressure selling, and a lack of transparency"". ""In the process guests are paying more than they should for rooms."" The BHA also said contract terms with some sites often included clauses that stopped a hotel offering a lower price on its own website than that offered to the online travel agent. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, also highlighted commission rates: ""The starting rate is 15%, which means that £15 out of every £100 stay is being taken by the intermediary. ""Hotels sometimes pay even more commission for increased visibility - i.e. giving the booking site even more in return for a higher profile on search returns."" He says he tends to contact the hotel direct, to see if they will match the online rate and ""perhaps provide a bonus such as a welcome drink or a free breakfast into the bargain"". The CMA has written to companies across the whole sector. It is seeking evidence from both the websites and hotels, and would also like consumers to get in touch with it and share their experiences. It will look into how search results are ranked, and it also wants more information on whether extra charges, such as taxes and booking fees, are clearly displayed. Another area being looked at is the way sites display how many rooms are left, how many people are viewing a particular hotel and messages that claim to state the last time at which a similar room was booked. Ms Arora said the CMA wanted to hear how the sites gathered the information for these claims. The CMA is concerned this is used for ""pressure selling"", creating a ""false impression of room availability or rush customers into making a booking decision"". Social worker Valentin Danciu, from Ipswich, told the BBC that he had used a hotel booking website to reserve an apartment in Germany which was advertised at £31 per night. However, when the booking confirmation arrived it also included a €22 service charge and a €45 cleaning fee. Mr Danciu said he had been using hotel booking sites for years, but this time seemed to have missed the small print. He said until he received the email confirmation he had been given no indication that the total amount would be more than £90. The investigation into hotel websites follows a year-long CMA probe into price comparison sites. The CMA concluded that price comparison websites worked best for car insurance and worst for broadband.",Hotel booking sites are to be probed by the UK's competition watchdog to see if consumers are being misled by them.
"ECB president Mario Draghi said the 19-country bloc grew faster than expected in the first half of the year. It came as the bank kept eurozone interest rates and its bond buying stimulus programme unchanged. Mr Draghi said the ECB would probably make decisions about its stimulus measures next month. The ECB is currently buying 60bn euros (£55bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. But analysts expect this to be scaled back in the months ahead given the eurozone's recovery. Robust growth The ECB raised its economic growth forecast from 1.9% to 2.2%, which would be the fastest rate since the 3.0% seen in 2007 before the financial crisis started to bite. ""There was a general recognition of the progress made by the eurozone recovery,"" Mr Draghi said. ""It's robust, it's broad-based, and it was recalled that six million jobs were created since 2013."" However, the bank also cut its forecast for eurozone inflation to 1.2% next year and 1.5% in 2019 - below the ECB's 2% target. Analysts say this is making the decision on when the bank begins to rein in its stimulus more complicated. Mr Draghi said ""a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation"" was still needed to help boost inflation. He also said the rise in the euro - which has gained 13% in value against the dollar this year - was a source of ""uncertainty"". However, his comments were not enough to suppress the euro, which rose 0.8% against the dollar to $1.20. It also increased 0.5% against the pound to almost hit 92 pence. 'Dialled down' Patrick O'Donnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""There's no question that the ECB is worried about the euro's appreciation but there's little [Mr Draghi] can actually do about it."" He added the markets widely expected the bank to announce plans in October on winding back QE. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""We think the central bank is trying to send the message that the degree of stimulus will be dialled down as the economy improves, but not removed altogether."" Figures released earlier on Thursday confirmed that the eurozone's economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to June, following growth of 0.5% in the first quarter of the year. However, despite the pick-up in growth, inflation within the eurozone remains slower than the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Inflation in the bloc was 1.5% in August. The ECB kept all its main interest rates unchanged, with the benchmark refinancing rate staying at 0%. The deposit facility rate stayed at -0.4%, which means banks pay money to leave their cash at the ECB. The ECB said it still expected rates to ""remain at their present levels for an extended period of time"".","The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised its eurozone economic growth forecast for this year to 2.2%, the fastest growth in 10 years."
"By Kevin Peachey and Daniele PalumboBBC News This is most clearly illustrated among 35 to 54-year-olds. As the numbers of those getting a mortgage to buy has dropped, so private renting has risen. The credit crunch has also led to homeowners becoming more likely to stay put owing to factors including affordability and availability of mortgages. In contrast, moves within the rental sector have grown and many tenants, especially those with children, have complained that renting can mean a lack of security. Landlords may ask them to move at short notice, leading to disruption with schooling and family life. The number of families with children who rent their home from a private landlord has tripled in the course of 10 years. This is a lifestyle choice for some but many of these parents want to bring up their children in a home they own, says the housing charity Shelter. Since December last year, tenants in Scotland have had indefinite security of tenure. But some tenants in England and Wales feel the security of their domestic life is determined by their landlord. Then there is the cost - and how rent levels have changed in the last 10 years depends on where you live, north or south. For those in London, the South East or the East of England, there has been a significant increase but the picture is much more stable in other parts of England and Wales.",The UK is a nation of homeowners but the decade since the financial crisis has seen a shift towards residents living in accommodation rented from a private landlord.
"By Justin HarperBusiness Reporter Travel and leisure stocks including airlines and cinema chains have been hit hard by the coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions. While their valuations have plummeted across the board, some stocks have seen their share prices rocket this week. On Tuesday, cinema chain Cineworld shot up almost 50% while cruise ship operator Carnival surged more than 20%. Cineworld, the world's second biggest cinema chain, announced bosses had waived salaries and bonuses as part of a survival plan to tackle coronavirus lockdowns. Admitting the current situation was ""extremely challenging"", Cineworld said it had scrapped a planned dividend to shareholders for the last quarter of 2019. But its share price shot up 49% on the London Stock Exchange despite its bleak outlook, with more than 780 cinemas closed across 10 countries. Another travel and leisure stock, cruise ship operator Carnival, also saw a big price rise on Tuesday, after Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund took a 8.2% stake in it. Carnival's share price rose 11% on the New York Stock Exchange and 22% on the London Stock Exchange. The cruise ship industry has been battered during the coronavirus pandemic with a number of outbreaks at sea raising concerns about the safety of cruise holidays. Carnival has cancelled a series of scheduled sailings for 2020 and said it may struggle with bookings for 2021. Given the dire outlook for the industry, experts are warning investors to tread cautiously when thinking these stocks have ""bottomed out"" and may be staging a recovery. ""Leisure and travel stocks are emerging from a deep and dark place,"" said Stephen Innes, global market strategist at AxiCorp. ""While people will return to cinemas, revenues may be slow to pick up as movie goers and the industry respects social distancing guidelines."" After cinemas reopen, Mr Innes says they may continue to space out customers, which will reduce capacity and revenues. ""After all, the last thing a movie chain wants to get accused of is being the next super spreader epicentre"". Grounded planes Low-cost airline Easyjet saw it share price jump 15% on Tuesday, having secured a £600m coronavirus loan from the government. Some airlines are facing collapse as they are forced to ground planes while debts continue to mount. Easyjet's rescue package comes at the same time airline industry trade body IATA published research showing that some 25 million jobs are at risk of disappearing with plummeting demand for air travel during the crisis. ""Many questions remain as to just how eager travellers are willing to board the confines of an airplane cabin even after the pandemic subsides,"" added Mr Innes. The pan-European Stoxx 600 shares index rose 1.7% on Tuesday, with travel and leisure stocks rising 6.2%. ""People are trying to identify risks and opportunities now, and at last they believe they can better identify them,"" said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities. ""But the virus is still the greatest known unknown for the markets and for financial professionals."" Analysts are warning it may take longer for consumption to get back on track across all sectors, not just travel and leisure. ""In short, it's still bad for airlines, bad for international hotels and slightly positive for domestic leisure activities. But still too early to say when the lockdown or social distancing rules will be relaxed,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING bank. Even when restrictions are lifted, demand ""could be slow to gain traction due to psychological scars, defaults, bankruptcies, and job losses,"" added Mr Pang.",Investors are being warned about piling money into the travel and leisure sectors after their recent surge.
"Revenues rose by a higher than expected 22% from a year earlier to $3.3bn (£2.5bn), marking the 15th consecutive month of increases in the special administrative region of China. Macau is the only place in the country where casino gambling is legal. An 11% rise in visitors from the mainland and several big bets from VIPs helped to boost revenue. The VIP sector consists of gamblers who typically make bets of about $150,000. However, the market is volatile and casino operators Sands China and Wynn Macau are keen to develop the mass market area, in which growth was slower. The holiday week, which took place from 1 to 8 October, lasted one day longer than in 2016.",Gambling revenues in Macau hit a three-year high in October as a national holiday week led to more visitors.
"Helen ThomasNewsnight business editor@helentbbcon Twitter According to one industry source, the industry is seeing 20-25 so-called ""blanks"" over a two week period. Based on the usual number of container vessels visiting the UK's biggest ports like Southampton and Felixstowe, that represents about 30% to 35% of the usual inbound capacity. Other sources agreed that there had been a significant drop in arrivals, and said that arriving ships were also carrying less cargo than usual. But some cautioned that volumes usually fell around Chinese New Year in January which made it harder to assess the direct impact of the coronavirus, now called Covid19. Large container ships take around 6-8 weeks to sail from China to the UK, so the impact of the shutdown of factories in China will start to be felt more keenly in the coming weeks. The Chinese authorities shut down Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak and a major manufacturing hub, in late January. These big vessels can also make other stops, some said, raising the prospect of shortfalls of goods coming from other countries in Asia like Japan and South Korea. Manufacturers in other countries can themselves also rely on parts that are imported from China. A wide range of goods could be affected by the disruption to global trade, including electronics components and devices, automotive parts, textiles and clothing. Businesses can try to find alternative suppliers of goods, albeit at a higher cost, although that may also become more challenging as the impact of coronavirus spreads. Air freight, which accounts for about 40% of the UK's imports and exports, has also been severely disrupted after airlines like British Airways cancelled flights from and from mainland China in late January. Passenger flights carry cargo in the bellyhold, which accounts for a large portion of overall cargo volumes. Heathrow, where 95% of the cargo is carried in the bellyhold of passenger aircraft, says it it accounts for 40% of the UK's non-EU and Swiss exports, for example. Prices for air freight have spiked, with two industry bodies telling Newsnight that their members were being offered air freight at between five and 10 times the normal price, a situation that had worsened over the past month. Companies and business groups said they were expecting to see shortages of some parts and products show up in the coming weeks, though it remained hard to predict where the pressure would be most acute.

"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Some 140,000 homeowners are trapped on high interest-rate home loans with unregulated or inactive firms, and are unable to switch to a cheaper deal. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has now said it is considering a change to its affordability checks. This could allow these people to switch to deals that are easier to pay. At present, they are stuck on high default rates, owing to an FCA requirement - introduced in 2014 - for mortgage holders to meet strict affordability criteria when they apply for a new fixed deal. In a letter to the Treasury Committee of MPs, FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said the planned changes would apply only to those in this situation who are not seeking to borrow more on their mortgage, but just want to get the cost down. ""The test would be whether the new mortgage costs are more affordable than the current mortgage costs,"" he said. Banks and building societies would still need to agree to take on these customers. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""We will continue to work constructively with our broad range of members and the FCA to help ensure those customers who want a like-for-like mortgage can switch lenders more easily."" Northern Rock fallout An interim report into the mortgage market, published in May by the FCA, highlighted the plight of these borrowers. These ""mortgage prisoners"" are unable to move to a better deal when their existing mortgages switched to the more expensive standard variable rate, even if they could meet the payments. The FCA said it had identified about 150,000 such customers. Of these, about 30,000 were with authorised mortgage lenders, while about 120,000 had mortgages held by non-regulated firms, which include some previous Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley customers. Some are saddled with such high costs that they face the prospect of falling behind on repayments. Some 10,000 of them are with lenders who are still actively operating in the mortgage market. These customers have received letters during the latter half of last year outlining some of the alternative mortgage deals available from their existing lender. The new proposals flagged by the FCA would change the regulations to assist the rest. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said: ""The regulator must now act swiftly to help these 140,000 mortgage prisoners and not use this consultation to kick the issue into the long grass."" Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, who has campaigned on the issue, said: ""Finally, a welcome and sensible move. For over four years we've been saying that it's ludicrous that people are failing affordability tests because they're absurdly told they cannot afford a cheaper deal than the one they're already on.""

"By Jim ReedReporter, Victoria Derbyshire programme The legal action is aiming to establish the drivers with worker status, rather than as self-employed customers or partners - which is how Uber sees them. The first four cases were lodged last week, arguing the company is breaching its duty on basic rights. Uber says most of its drivers want the flexibility its approach offers. Drivers pay a fee to use the Uber technology. When a job comes up the nearest driver is offered it, otherwise it goes to the next person. For this, Uber takes a fee of 20%, soon to rise to 25% for new drivers. Employment lawyer Nigel Mackay, who is representing the drivers, said Uber was not complying with employment law. Find out more Watch Jim Reed's film about Uber here. ""What we want to do is try and ensure these drivers get workers' rights, the rights that anyone who works is entitled to. Things like minimum wage, the right to paid holiday,"" he said. He added that the ways in which Uber controlled its drivers - including the provision of initial training, guides as to which routes to take and requirements for minimum hours - meant they were not just self-employed. Mr Mackay said there were also serious health and safety issues as currently Uber did not ensure its drivers take rest breaks or work a maximum number of hours per week. ""A lot of these workers work 50, 60, 70 hours per week - they should be entitled to paid time off for doing that work,"" he said. ""I think it's true that there's a real risk to health and safety if drivers are being pushed by circumstance to drive these long hours - because they are not sitting in an office, it is a potentially dangerous job."" James's experience James Farrar has worked for Uber since last December. ""I joined because I was working on a start-up so I needed the flexibility to work when I wanted, while having the remainder free for research and writing. The flexibility with Uber is really great. ""The only problem is that when you're not working you're not earning and your earnings are so much lower than I expected. It's really starting to bite now. ""It's more difficult to make money than six months ago. There's a certain amount of money [I want to be earning] each day and I just need to stay out longer and longer to earn it. ""My average pay in July was £5.03 an hour, well below the minimum wage. So if you want to cover your costs and keep the family afloat, you've got to work a lot of hours. ""I wouldn't want to be picked up myself by somebody who has worked 18 hours a day. Since we are self-employed, Uber does not take responsibility for that occupational risk. ""I could get another job, but Uber has so aggressively come into the market, the chances of working for other operators are rapidly evaporating."" GMB, the union that represents professional drivers, has instructed Leigh Day to take the action on behalf of its members driving for Uber. The first cases were submitted to the London Central Employment Tribunal. The law firm says it will be submitting further claims and will be asking the tribunal to hear them all together. Uber describes itself as a ""fully licenced"" service that connects potential passengers with a background-checked private driver and takes a cut - typically 20% - of the fee. It currently operates in 10 cities in the UK. It had 7,000 drivers in London in 2014, a number which has risen to 20,000 this year. Flexibility Uber says the drivers are self-employed not workers and therefore and therefore they do not have to guarantee them a minimum wage. Uber's regional general manager, Jo Bertram, said most of its drivers had moved from traditional jobs with prescribed shifts as they wanted the flexibility Uber's approach offered. ""The fact you can work literally whenever you want, spend time with kids, you can build business on the side. That's the flexibility the majority of Uber drivers are looking for,"" she said. She added the company looked at how much money the drivers took home very carefully. ""What we find is drivers using the app actually take home around £15 or £16 an hour. Obviously their costs vary hugely depending on whether they rent or own and a number of other factors, but the majority are actually making around £10/12 per hour even after costs."" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.","More than 100 drivers for app-based taxi company Uber are looking to take action over their rights, lawyers have told the Victoria Derbyshire programme."
"The European giant aims to produce six of its A320 jets each month by 2020 at its final assembly plant near Beijing. During his three-day visit, Mr Macron said both France and China must open up to doing business with each other. At present, he said, France has ""access to markets which is unbalanced [and] unsatisfying"". He told an audience of French and Chinese business leaders: ""If we don't deal with this responsibly, the first natural reaction will be to close up on both sides."" As part of the agreement, Airbus said it will ""enhance its industrial partnership in Tianjin"" which is one of four global facilities that assemble the A320 family of planes, whose wings are made in the UK. Airbus said it hopes to ""strengthen the cooperation with regards to technical innovation, engineering capabilities and supply chain expansion"". Airbus currently produces four aircraft a month at the facility but said this will rise to five by 2019 before reaching a monthly turnout of six jets by early 2020. The company is one of a number of businesses travelling with Mr Macron on his first state visit since being elected last May. He has called on Europe to take a more coordinated approach to trade with China. Mr Macron said that in the past, countries had come to China with different agendas and varying degrees of openness.

"By Padraig BeltonTechnology of Business reporter But three days later, they realised it wasn't typhoid - it was the deadly Ebola virus. This delay, says Dr Jude Senguku, meant that his flatmate - the hospital's senior surgeon - caught the disease from the woman and died, along with two nursing staff. It was a harsh lesson in the crucial importance of fast - and accurate - diagnostics. Mis-diagnosis, panic and misinformation led to people in Liberia staying away from hospital, he says. Some would misrepresent their symptoms to avoid being sent to Ebola isolation units. ""To rule out - and rapidly screen for - Ebola became important,"" says Dr Senguku. 'Very critical' Fortunately, Redemption Hospital received one of the first machines for Ebola testing - a piece of kit called GeneXpert that could provide a cheap and accurate diagnosis within 90 minutes. Given that Liberia had only 50 doctors for 4.3 million people at the outbreak of the epidemic, such easy-to-use equipment proved crucial in the fight to contain the disease. As it was, Liberia was hit hard, officially recording 4,809 deaths from Ebola, the most anywhere in the disease's 2014-2016 outbreak. Since then, Dr Senguku says the diagnostic technology has been ""very critical"" in reducing false Ebola scares and restoring confidence among the people of Monrovia. Dr David Persing, who created the rapid diagnostic test, is executive vice president of Cepheid, a Silicon Valley-based biotechnology company. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed $3.5m (£2.7m) to the project. Simply put, the machine measures the nucleic acid in a patient's specimen - spit, say - and detects a disease's signature DNA sequence. This method, called a nucleic acid amplification test, can detect extremely low levels of a pathogen, along with drug-resistant variants. The test cartridge costs $10 for poorer countries, while the machine itself costs about $17,000. 'Easy to use' Portable, low-energy diagnostic kits that are easy to operate are particularly important in areas with limited access to power or expensive laboratory equipment. Simple malaria tests detecting antigens, and HIV tests which look for antibodies - like those developed by Massachusetts-based medical technology company Alere - can test ""rapidly far from a lab"", says Dr Megan Coffee, an infectious disease specialist and technical advisor at the International Rescue Committee. She says many of these ""point of care"" tests - most of which consist of a membrane in a plastic cassette - are as ""easy to use as a pregnancy test stick, which require no electricity, no refills, and can be carried and used by mobile community health workers."" This is useful for big mining companies and other major employers. For example, gold miner Randgold Resources' Loulo-Gounkoto mine is a five or six hour drive away from the nearest Ebola assessment centre, says Dr Haladou Mahaman Manirou, who works for the company. An on-site clinic monitors employees and people from neighbouring villages. Along with Ebola, other infectious diseases, like malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, are the ""main burden"" on his employees' health, says Dr Manirou. Malaria affected 39% of Randgold's workforce in 2015. The figure was 69% in 2011. A 15-minute diagnostic test, developed by Flow, a US biotechnology company, has helped quickly identify and treat cases, he says. And now the next step for diagnostic technology is to ""test for multiple causes of, say, a fever"", she says. For example, Singapore-based medical technology company STMicroelectronics has developed a ""Lab-on-Chip"" platform, which is the size of a fingernail and can test for multiple tropical diseases in a single blood sample. The lab on a chip is slightly more expensive than a GeneXpert cartridge - roughly $100 - but doesn't require a machine. Remote diagnosis As well as on-the-spot testing, diagnoses can also take place thousands of miles away, thanks to internet technology. Global Health Telemedicine, for example, run by Dr Michelangelo Bartolo, director of telemedicine at San Giovanni Hospital in Rome, has connected doctors in 19 health centres in Africa with 100 volunteer specialists in Europe. The average response time is ""about three hours"", says Dr Bartolo. In two years of operation, there have been 3,500 ""tele-consultations"", including 1,300 electrocardiograms. His software includes a feature to allow African doctors to fill out information when offline, too, which is a useful feature in areas with patchy connectivity. The need for speed But battling the next epidemic after Ebola will require being faster off the block, says Dr Persing. ""To get started on test development in the middle of an epidemic just doesn't work,"" he says, adding his company doesn't have test cartridges for Zika, Lassa Fever, or ""all the things that could come up"". A ""just-in-time delivery"" model would work better, he says. If world health officials designated a list of critical infectious diseases, businesses like his could pre-manufacture and pre-validate agents for the test, and get regulatory approval for them, he believes. ""If you have an epidemic, you don't want to wait for six months or a year to have a test available,"" says Dr Persing. Speedy diagnostics can also help measure the effectiveness of health campaigns, argues Prof David Alland, chief of infectious diseases at Rutgers Medical School. ""In some parts of Africa, it was thought major malaria intervention programmes weren't working,"" he says. But it turned out doctors were incorrectly diagnosing malaria based on patients' clinical symptoms. More accurate diagnostic technology showed anti-malaria programmes were actually more effective than people believed. So the more we know, and the quicker we know it, the more lives we can save.

"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, Geneva First, it is French. Second, it's a relative newcomer. Third, the bulk of its watches are aimed at women in a still male-dominated industry. Hermes is at this week's Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) watch fair in Geneva, where the display cabinets are weighed down with chunky timepieces as complicated as a Ferrari car (but frequently cost more). ""We are one of the challengers to an industry that is 300 years old,"" says Laurent Dordet, who heads the watch division, La Montre Hermes. He knows there's a lot of work to do ""to become legitimate and accepted"". It helps being at this week's annual watch event, an invitation-only affair where Switzerland's most exclusive brands and artisan workshops unveil their latest products. Paris-based Hermes is allowed in because it makes its watches in Switzerland. The listed, but still family-owned company, better known for its leather and silk products, got into ladies' watches about four decades ago, and men's in 2012. But it is only in recent years that it became a more serious player, investing heavily to buy up Swiss component makers. La Montre Hermes now produces all the dials, cases, and movements in-house - unlike some competitors. The division employs about 300 people, a fraction of the 13,000 employed in the core businesses. Mr Dordet, a Hermes lifer, used to run the leather goods business, where his products were at the top of the luxury tree. In the industry, Hermes' leather watch straps were as highly regarded as the watches. It makes straps for brands such as Parmigiani, and they are also available for the Apple Watch. Now, since his appointment in 2015, he's running an operation where the brand must work harder to get noticed. ""It's a challenge,"" Mr Dordet says. He's been taking La Montre Hermes up the value chain. The business used to trade in the €2,000-€3,000 ($2,280-$3,420; £1,770-£2,660) bracket. Pricy to most people, but not in the world of fine watches. But having a completely in-house operation means Hermes can design and produce far more complicated pieces, not just in the looks but the mechanics inside. Hermes' standard watches now cost as much as €30,000, while special pieces with jewels are €100,000-plus. Ariel Adams, founder of the closely-read website ablogtowatch.com, says female fashion house watches - where the product is just one of many luxury items - have traditionally not been taken as seriously as those produced by firms that only make timepieces. ""There has been an unfortunate bias by collectors against watch brands that appear to primarily produce products for women,"" he says. ""I've personally never quite understood this. Perhaps it is the large assortment of comparatively inexpensive women's fashion watches that have prevented more high-end customers from taking the watches more seriously."" Mr Dordet wants to challenge that bias. Hermes' new products on display at SIHH are among the most complicated yet, he says. Its Galop d'Hermes woman's watch is not round and not symmetrical (as most watches are). That in itself makes developing the movement more difficult. It's a watch that he hopes will be appreciated not only for its design (which perhaps is the thing most consumers only consider), but its mechanics. Female executives ""It's not a classic [female] watch,"" Mr Dordet says, adding in marketing-speak that could only come from a luxury goods executive: ""It's a futuristic object for today's femininity... a woman of movement, a working person, full of projects."" What he means is that the female watch consumer is changing - less bling and sparkle, and timepieces embedded in necklaces or brooches; and more for traditional, and slightly larger, wristwatches. Mr Dordet adds that it will be interesting to see how the industry changes as more female executives enter the business. In 2017, Chabi Nouri became the first woman chief executive of Piaget, while Catherine Reiner's appointment last year as boss of the 175-year-old Jaeger-LeCoultre was also a female first. And the managing director of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, which organises SIHH, is female, Fabienne Lupo. Smartwatch threat What of Hermes' men's watches, a business started only seven years ago? It could be an uphill struggle. ""When you have a stamp on your forehead that says you are mainly a female fashion brand it's hard to convince the guys,"" says Mr Dordet. ""We are winning more respect from male customers year after year. But it's slow because we are coming into a world where well-established men's brands have existed for decades, even centuries,"" he says. Ariel Adams is a fan, though. ""What they may lack in sheer exclusivity they make up for in a practical luxury appeal."" But Hermes is entering a crowded market, he adds. Interestingly, Hermes has looked into the possibility of putting smart tech in watches, an area perhaps more attractive to male consumers. However, it has discounted the move, for the moment at least. ""We haven't closed the door on it, but our conclusion is that this is not the time,"" Mr Dordet says. But, just as Hermes is establishing itself as a serious watch player, does Mr Dordet think smartwatches threaten the mechanical industry? ""Absolutely not. Smartwatches are cold, functional objects,"" he says. ""Fine watches are an experience, a jewel, a luxury, an emotion,"" he adds. ""One thing we are all sure of [at SIHH] is that people don't buy watches any more to see what time it is.""","Hermes may be a big cheese in the world of luxury goods, but in the world of Swiss watchmaking it is something of an outsider."
"By Cindy SuiBBC News, Taipei But ask any outsider about their knowledge of Taiwan's food, and you are likely to get a perplexed look, unlike its neighbours Japan and Korea, whose cuisines have very distinct identities. Other than bubble tea, few culinary inventions from Taiwan have gained fame beyond its borders, while the island only has one internationally-known food brand - dumpling maker Din Tai Fung. Now, Taiwan wants to raise the profile of its little-known cuisine, hoping to be known for more than just making many of the world's high-tech gadgets. To this end, the island has been organising the annual Taiwan Culinary Exhibition at home, as well as roadshows abroad. Such efforts have brought in more tourists and given a boost to Taiwan's food and beverage industry, valued at $14bn (£9bn) in 2014. But despite government assistance to help restaurants expand overseas and build a name for Taiwanese cuisine, not many have succeeded. Dumpling jackpot So far, only Din Tai Fung has managed to break out. The dumpling chain has opened 112 restaurants in 11 destinations around the world, from Sydney and Singapore to far-flung Seattle in the US. But its success may not be easily duplicated. Its fame stems from a strong focus on quality, and some luck. Din Tai Fung started selling its juicy minced pork dumplings in the 1980s and they proved immensely popular with the locals. But they were unknown worldwide until 1993, when the New York Times listed the restaurant as one of the world's top 10. Further recognition followed - fans now include Hollywood celebrities and and it's the only food brand in Taiwan that has earned a Michelin star. But others are struggling to match such success. Restaurant chain Shin Yeh has found it hard to expand overseas, as experts say its dishes - more complicated than Din Tai Fung's dumplings - are harder to duplicate abroad without exporting top chefs. But perhaps the main reason is simply that people overseas are unfamiliar with Taiwanese food. Some say even the Taiwanese themselves are not sure what constitutes Taiwanese food, and which dishes should take centre stage. Culinary identity? ""Only since 2000, when the Taiwanese sense of identity became stronger, did we start to wonder what Taiwanese food is - what can we present in terms of food that represents Taiwan?"" says May Chang, chief executive of the Foundation of Chinese Dietary Culture, which promotes Taiwan's cuisine. Taiwan's population is made up of immigrants, a majority from mainland China, so many if its recipes originate from there. The island was also a Japanese colony for 50 years, which explains the influence of flavours still present in some dishes to this day. Ms Chang says it's hard to find one type of food to represent Taiwan. ""A lot of our food comes from China,"" she says. ""For instance, oyster omelettes can also be found in China's Fujian province, so can beef noodle soup, even though we say ours is more tasty. And we have different ethnic groups who came from different parts of China, so it's sensitive - we can't just choose one group's food over another's to represent Taiwanese cuisine."" The Taiwanese feel so strongly about having an identity of their own, including their own food, that a heated debate arose a few years ago - after an international publication claimed that the popular local dish ""braised pork rice"" originated from mainland China. Many on the island argued that it was purely Taiwanese. But Taiwan does have unique flavours to its cuisine, which becomes immediately obvious during a visit to any night market. Some of the food may have originated from China or been influenced by other countries, but it has been re-invented by the Taiwanese. Examples include ""small sausage in big sausage"" (a pork sausage topped with pickled fillings stuffed in an open, bigger rice sausage), ""sesame oil chicken"" (chicken stewed in sesame oil and rice wine), ""coffin bread"" (a thick toast filled with a seafood soup), and ""san su"" (stir-fried fern with anchovies). Indigenous cuisine The fern dish is one from Taiwan's indigenous tribes, another favourite being fish cooked using heated stones. Much of the tribes' cuisine is distinctive and not commonly seen, but this could soon change. The cuisine of Taiwan's indigenous people is increasingly being valued. In the past, they didn't have the ability to promote their own food because of the high costs, so it was mainly tasted by Taiwanese people on sightseeing trips to the tribal areas. But now there are companies providing funding to set up restaurants that hire indigenous people to work as cooks. They're also opening their own restaurants, like Daluan Restaurant, owned by a member of the Amis tribe. Hsia Hui-wen, founder of Taiwan Chefs Federation, says the government should do more to promote Taiwan's food. ""We have to let people know our food is distinctive - it's made in a healthier way than Chinese cuisine, with less heavy sauces, and includes flavours from immigrants,"" he says. He argues the island's cuisine is becoming better known. ""Taiwanese cuisine was previously not even considered a type of Chinese cuisine (like Sichuanese or Cantonese cuisine), but now there is such a category,"" Mr. Hsia said. ""And in many countries' Chinatowns, you can see Taiwanese restaurants (unlike in the past when you would only see Chinese restaurants)… it's become a brand,"" he said. Building a brand Some wonder whether it matters that Taiwan's food comes from elsewhere. The point is being proud of it. While some young chefs at Taipei's Kai Ping Culinary School say they are more interested in opening Japanese or other restaurants after graduating, because they think it's more profitable, others are aspiring to represent Taiwan's food on the global stage. ""What we need to do is make our food stand out, such as by using more local ingredients, and innovating new flavours that no one else has but everybody loves,"" says student chef Shao Chi-han. There's an increasing trend to do just that - combining different flavours and cooking styles of Taiwan's indigenous and ethnic groups as well as other countries, using local ingredients and presenting it in a new way. This can be seen in an increasing number of restaurants, including at top hotels. But for now, Din Tai Fung is an exception and a lesson: If Taiwan wants more of its cuisine to win over palettes around the world, not only will it have to make its food taste great, but ensure it becomes a well recognised brand, just like the famous little dumplings.","Surrounded by the sea, Mother Nature has blessed Taiwan with an abundance of marine life. And with plenty of farms located near cities, there's always a ready supply of fresh ingredients for your next meal."
"Israel-based Sodastream makes a machine and refillable cylinders allowing users to make their own carbonated drinks. The deal gives Pepsi a new way of reaching customers in their homes at a time when its signature sugary drinks are becoming less popular. It is also the company's first big acquisition since chief executive Indra Nooyi disclosed she would step down in October after 12 years at the helm. PepsiCo will buy all outstanding shares of Sodastream for $144 each - almost 11% higher than its closing price in New York on Friday. The stock has soared 85% this year after rising by 78% in 2017. The takeover has already been approved by the boards of both firms. PepsiCo president Ramon Laguarta, who will succeed Ms Nooyi on 3 October, said Sodastream was ""highly complementary and incremental"" to Pepsi's business. ""PepsiCo is finding new ways to reach consumers beyond the bottle,"" he added. Sodastream has repositioned itself as a sparkling water maker to appeal to younger consumers who are more health and environmentally conscious and increasingly shun soft drinks. ""With sugary carbonates and juices struggling and no turnaround in sight, mitigating the losses through newer and healthier products will be essential for PepsiCo,"" said Euromonitor International analyst Matthew Barry. The market research firm says bottled water sales rose 6.2% annually in the five years to 2017, while carbonated soft drinks sales were flat. If regulators approve the deal, it is expected to be finalised by January 2019, subject to a vote by Sodastream shareholders. Sodastream was originally founded in the UK in 1903 and went through various changes of ownership until it became a subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes in 1985. In 1998, it was bought by Israeli firm Soda-Club, with its UK manufacturing plant in Peterborough closing in 2003.",PepsiCo has announced it is buying Sodastream for $3.2bn (£2.5bn).

"By Gabriella MulliganCape Town Governments in these countries are betting that faster 4G internet connections over the airwaves, rather than down expensive wired infrastructures, will give businesses a welcome productivity boost. The tech upgrade is already making a difference to many small businesses. ""Having much faster internet access means we get more done,"" says Yomi Adegboye, a Nigerian entrepreneur running a popular blog that reviews mobiles and gadgets. Africa goes mobile (sub-Saharan figures) 365 million mobile phone subscribers (40% of population) 508 million by 2020 (49% of pop.) 1% of mobile users have access to 4G 6% forecast to have 4G by 2020 It has had a ""huge"" impact on his business, he says. ""I can get things done online in a much shorter and faster period of time than I could before now. Downloads are easier. This makes for greater efficiency and faster customer support,"" he adds. Mr Adegboye is one of the first people in Nigeria - and Africa - to enjoy 4G mobile internet. courtesy of telecoms firm, the Smile Group. Its chief executive, Irene Charnley, tells the BBC that the need for high-speed data services is much greater in countries that have no fixed-line infrastructure. 'Massively different' But why are they moving straight to 4G on a continent where vast expanses of land don't have 3G or even a 2G mobile signal, let alone fixed-lined internet? It is because ""4G is the quickest and most cost-effective means to access digital services"", she says. The 4G LTE (Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution) standard was designed first and foremost as a reliable, high-speed internet service, says Ms Charnley. 4G is the quickest and most cost-effective means to access digital services ""4G is massively different in terms of quality, reliability and speed...it is not like 2G, which was designed for voice and then added some very slow data services, or 3G that was for voice and data but ended up being a compromise,"" she says. Smile's 4G customers in Africa are enjoying average download speeds of 6Mbps (megabits per second), she says, with some experiencing 21Mbps. This average compares favourably to average 3G network speeds in UK cities. The acceleration in internet speed is certainly being appreciated by small business owners like Mr Adegboye. ""It is a completely different world from the 3G I had been using,"" he says. ""It is much faster, and much more stable and reliable than anything else we have ever used."" Digital India In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is prioritising internet connectivity under his ""Digital India"" initiative, in the hope that this will help modernise all aspects of the country, from health and education, to food supply and manufacturing. The country's 950 million mobile users still use their phones primarily to make voice calls - internet penetration remains very low across the country. Sameer Pitalwalla, chief executive of Culture Machine, a digital entertainment company making programmes for mobile and computer, is certainly looking forward to faster internet speeds. ""As the internet connectivity becomes fatter... one sees a direct co-relationship with users watching more video,"" he told the BBC's India Business Report. ""We see that not only will our subscriber base increase... it will be a rising tide which will lift all boats, because people will have access to content."" Last month India's largest telecom, Airtel, became the first to roll out 4G services. Other operators are likely to follow suit, precipitating a possible price war. But consumers and businesses will be hoping that 4G in India proves more reliable that the country's existing 3G and 2G services, which have been patchy to say the least. A paucity of mobile phone masts and limited radio spectrum has hampered efficiency, operators say. Modi's government recently auctioned off more spectrum to pave the way for faster connectivity. Rural slow lane? But as India and Africa embrace high-speed mobile internet, their rural communities may wonder whether they will miss out on this technological advance, given that operators tend to concentrate their roll-out plans on more affluent, urban areas. Bongo Futuse, spokesman for South African operator Vodacom, almost concedes as much, saying: ""Deployment is a function of a number of factors, including spectrum availability, sufficient backhaul, adequate user base, smartphone penetration, and so on. ""These factors tend to dictate a roll-out strategy that initially starts in urban areas and then moves to rural."" For this reason, Danson Njue, a research analyst at Ovum, argues that governments must get involved in 4G deployment, either directly or through subsidies to private operators. ""As has always been the case, telcos focus their investments in areas that guarantee a return on investment. In my opinion, it requires government intervention, or to give subsidies to encourage investment in the rural areas,"" he says. One solution, says Mr Njue, is for governments to own the network, and telecoms operators to buy access and distribute it to customers. This, he says, would achieve nationwide coverage much faster than the fragmented approach of relying on individual operators. 'Good example' Rwanda's government has already adopted this approach, with Mr Njue saying the country ""serves as a good example where this model is working perfectly"". Carlos Martin Mwizerwa of Olleh Rwanda Networks (ORN), a public-private partnership operating the country's only 4G network, says ORN expects to achieve 95% 4G coverage of Rwanda's territory by 2017, with 98% of populated areas accounted for. He believes the partnership approach enables a much quicker roll-out of services, because individual private operators are not wasting time building competing networks. ""Developing markets hardly have the time for a long deployment period and this approach promotes quick and affordable access to broadband services and reduces the digital divide,"" he says, ""especially in emerging countries where rural areas are generally underserved by both mobile and fixed broadband access operators."" In India, Mr Modi's ambition is to extend high-speed internet access to rural areas where more than half the country's population live. He may do well to learn some lessons from Africa.",The roll-out of high-speed mobile connectivity in Africa and India is demonstrating yet again how emerging economies can leapfrog traditional developmental stages to accelerate their economic growth.
"The average parental contribution for home buyers this year will be £18,000, down 17% from last year's £21,600, according to Legal & General (L&G). The drop shows that parents are ""feeling the pinch"", the firm says. Nonetheless, more than one in four buyers are still expected to receive financial help from friends or family. In total, financial services firm L&G said 27% of home buyers would get assistance - up from 25% last year. Despite the smaller sums being loaned, L&G said the so-called Bank of Mum and Dad was still ""a prime mover"" in the UK housing market. 'My parents had put aside money to gift me' Francesca Hunt, from London, was given between £20,000 and £30,000 (she does not want to say the exact amount) by her parents last year to help her buy a house. She had enough money by herself for a deposit on a one-bed flat, but her parents thought a two-bedroom flat was a better investment. ""My parents decided that the price difference from a one to a two bed isn't, in the grand scheme of things, too much more,"" she says. Francesca said her parents had already put aside money to gift her at some point. ""If not, I would have inherited the money anyway. Better to use it now to get on the property ladder before prices go up even further,"" she says. The money her parents provided was ""gifted"" and Francesca says they don't own any of her flat as a result of their investment. L&G said almost 317,000 housing transactions this year would rely on at least some parental help. However, overall lending was expected to drop to £5.7bn this year from £6.5bn in 2017. Where buyers live also has a big impact on how much they rely on their parents for help. In London, the average parental contribution is £31,000 compared with £11,000 in Scotland. Bank of Mum and Dad in numbers ""People are feeling a bit of a pinch around the economy and therefore we're seeing pretty much a national trend outside of London for less to be given,"" L&G chief executive Nigel Wilson told the BBC. ""The volume of transactions depending on Bank of Mum and Dad funding keeps on growing, even as parents find it harder to provide as much money for the deposit."" He said it was not ""sustainable or fair"" for parents and young people to ""remain so co-dependent when it comes to housing purchases"".","Parents are parting with thousands of pounds to help their children get on the property ladder, but they can't afford to lend as much as they used to."
"Underlying replacement cost profit, which strips out the effect of oil price movements, was $3.69bn (£2.29bn) - down from $5.02bn for the same period a year ago.

However, the result beat market forecasts of $3.17bn, while the company raised its dividend to shareholders. It said it would pay out 9.5 cents a share - an increase of 5.6% - and added it would sell assets worth $10bn over the next two years, handing most of the proceeds to shareholders.

"By Simon GompertzPersonal finance correspondent, BBC News Dominic Lindley of New City Agenda made the estimate as CYBG warned of a potential £450m bill for new claims. Shares fell 21% to record lows. The owner of Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Virgin Money blamed an ""unprecedented volume"" of complaints sparked by the 29 August deadline for claims. Other banks also face higher costs. Royal Bank of Scotland, owner of NatWest, said on Wednesday it could face a £900m charge, while Co-operative Bank said on Thursday it was assessing its costs. Mr Lindley, who has been keeping a tally at the think tank, said: ""This means that total provisions from the banks could reach £53bn."" He believes the bank with the biggest bill, Lloyds Banking Group, could announce an extra provision of £2bn, while Barclays might set aside as much as £1bn more. Neither Lloyds nor Barclays was able to comment on the speculation. The Financial Conduct Authority set the deadline for PPI claims at 23:59 on 29 August to try to stem the wave of claims. Policies were mis-sold to people who were borrowing money, but did not need the cover or would not be able to use it. PPI was designed to protect borrowers if they had an accident, fell sick or lost their job. But in millions of cases, the policyholders did not understand what they were paying for or that they might not be covered. The deadline sparked a wave of publicity and fresh claims, according to the industry. CYBG, which bought Virgin Money last year, said it received more than eight months' worth of requests for information about potential claims in just one month, with approximately 340,000 in aggregate over five weeks,. Some 120,000 of these were received in the final three days. It said it also received a sustained increase in complaints during the same period, with an average of 5,000 a week during the first four weeks of August and an additional 22,000 complaints submitted during the final three days. The typical compensation award across the industry is running at more than £2,000, but some people have been sent tens of thousands. Co-op Bank on Thursday said it had ""received a substantially greater volume of inquiries and complaints than expected in the final days prior to the complaint deadline"" and was assessing the impact on its costs for processing and paying out claims. Mr Lindley said the last-minute spike in PPI complaints would have ""a significant impact on the banks when they announce their next financial results"". Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, said the announcement by CYBG was ""really quite shocking in terms of the anticipated damage"". He pointed out that £400m is 20% of CYBG's current stock market. He now assumes that the bank will not pay a dividend for this year. CYBG's shares fell 20% to 110p - the lowest level since since it was spun out of National Australia Bank in 2016.","The payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal could cost banks £53bn, according to a forecast made as firms warned of mounting bills from claims."
"By Karishma VaswaniBBC News, Phnom Penh, Cambodia The 23-year-old is part of Cambodia's half-a-million-strong workforce - mostly young women - that keeps these garment factories running. Her income helps to provide for her and her young daughter, and like many others in the factories, she also sends money to her family back home in the village - a trend that has helped boost rural incomes. But ask Nun, or her friends, whether they would want their daughters to end up as factory workers in the garment industry and the answer is a vehement no. 'Barely make enough' These women, like so many of their counterparts, are getting increasingly angry. ""Our bosses make us work long hours, many times without a break and we barely make enough to survive,"" she tells me passionately, as we sit in her house surrounded by some of her friends. The women have been taking part in protests. Strikes and violent demonstrations at garment factories in Cambodia have quadrupled over the past year, and a recent report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) said that conditions at factories were worse now than they had been in recent years. ""We never have enough, especially for those workers who rent. Food is getting more expensive too,"" says Nun. ""I have my own house, but I have to spend money on transportation and food. ""The employers don't know the difficulties we face. They think, 'Oh this money is enough for the workers', but it's not."" Cambodia has some of the lowest wages in the region. Nun and her friends say they make $74 (£48) a month as garment factory workers - that's less than Cambodia's official minimum wage of $80 a month. With overtime, the women can sometimes bring home $100 a month - still far less than what garment workers in other parts of Asia earn. Wages v productivity The sector, which accounts for 80% of Cambodia's total exports, is the lifeline of the country's economy. However, the majority of factory owners in Cambodia are foreign. They have seen their businesses grow, thanks to a combination of low wages and a government keen on encouraging private enterprise. But workers are now demanding higher wages, saying that strong growth in the economy means they should see some of those benefits trickle down to them. For their part, industry bosses complain of intimidation and harassment, and say they can't afford to pay any more to their staff. ""These are not striking workers - these are hooligans,"" Ken Loo, the head of Cambodia's Garment Manufacturers Association, tells me as he plays video clips of violent protests outside a factory that supplies clothes to Nike. The demonstration took place in June and made international headlines. Footage shows workers wielding wooden sticks and throwing rocks. Riot police were brought in to control the crowd. Mr Loo says workers are getting increasingly militant and aggressive about their demands. ""As employers we do not object to strikes per se,"" he says, but they do object to ""any strikes that result in violence"". He says the harsh reality is that garment factories just cannot afford to pay their workers more because they're under so much pressure themselves. ""You say our wages are low, but the productivity in Cambodia is low too,"" he says. ""Vietnam's wages might be double that of Cambodia, but their productivity is about double. So cost per unit output is the same. ""If you compare against countries like Bangladesh - their wages are half, but their productivity is probably slightly lower but not a huge percent lower. So our unit cost per production is higher. "" Stalemate? International observers say it is unlikely the stand-off between workers and factory owners is going to end soon. ""I do believe that wages haven't kept up with inflation and that is very challenging for garment workers,"" says Jill Tucker, the chief technical adviser with the ILO's Better Factories programme in Cambodia. ""As such, I think the demonstrations in Cambodia are going to continue for some time."" According to Ms Tucker, the solution lies with the consumer. ""If you look at the global garment industry, you'll see that wages have risen across the board, material costs have risen, energy costs have risen, but none of us are paying more for our garments than we were a decade ago,"" she says. ""We have closets full of garments and we're paying the same amount or less. So it's very hard for factories to make a buck. Hopefully this is going to change, ""I think the era of cheap garments has maybe a few years left and maybe that's about it."" Cambodia is a nation on the move, but its garment industry is at a crossroads. How this issue is settled, may well decide what direction it takes from here.",Nun Vanak is an excellent example of how Cambodia's garment manufacturing industry has helped to change lives of hundreds of thousands of people in this country.
"The Swiss company said its sales in the first three months of 2012 were 21.4bn Swiss francs ($23.4bn; £14.6bn), up 5.6% from the same period last year.

"The biggest part of the additional costs relates to PPI mis-selling and lapses in the provision of mortgages. The bank said the discovery meant it would make a loss of £1.2bn to £1.3bn for 2013. It will release its full accounts in April. ""The starting capital position of the bank for the four to five year recovery period is weaker than in the plan announced last year,"" said chief executive Niall Booker. Mr Booker said the issues had already been discovered in its Liability Management Exercise prospectus, but said it was only now quantifying the financial impact of some of the risks. ""When I heard about this my jaw dropped because I did think that at last this was a bank on the way to recovery,"" said BBC economics editor Robert Peston. Rescue The Co-op Bank had to be rescued last year after it was left with a £1.5bn capital shortfall, with many of its troubles stemming from the merger with the Britannia building society in 2009. In November last year, it announced that a group of private investors, made up mostly of hedge funds, would inject nearly £1bn into the bank in exchange for a 70% ownership stake. Later that year the company was hit by a separate scandal when its chairman Paul Flowers was arrested in connection with a drugs supply investigation. The group is cutting staff and selling off parts of its business in an effort to survive. 'Simplify' The Co-operative Bank said that as of the end of 2013, it had cut 1,000 staff equating to about 14% of its total. It also said it had reduced its non-core assets by around £2bn. It said raising the extra £400m would enable it to continue with the execution of its original business plan. ""We have started to simplify the business, reduce costs and de-risk assets as we drive the change needed to return to our roots as a bank focused on our retail and SME customers,"" added Mr Booker.",The Co-op Bank plans to raise another £400m by issuing new shares following the discovery of additional costs related to past misconduct and poor documentation.
"In his first television interview, since taking office Mr Mnuchin told CNBC his priority was boosting growth. Mr Mnuchin said that tax cuts combined with deregulation would boost economic growth to 3% by the end of 2018. He said his team was still ""looking at"" the subject of a border adjustment tax that would put a tariff on imports. President Trump has promised to announce a ""phenomenal"" plan to reform the US tax system by early March. ""We are committed to pass tax reform, it will be very significant, it's going to be focused on middle income tax cuts, simplification and making the business tax competitive with the rest of the world,"" Mr Mnuchin told CNBC. He was confirmed as Treasury Secretary, the most senior economic role in the US administration, last week.

"By Anne CassidyBusiness reporter Kara Goldin says she unwittingly developed an addiction that impacted on her health - she was drinking up to 10 cans of diet cola every day. At the time, back in 2001, she was a Silicon Valley high flyer. ""I'd been drinking diet soda for years [by then], thinking I was doing the right thing,"" she says. ""I was just listening to the drinks industry say 'drink diet, and everything's going to be great'."" Unfortunately, Kara says that she came to the conclusion that drinking up to three and a half litres of caffeinated, artificially-sweetened liquid every day was making her feel lethargic. She also blamed the diet cola for her weight gain, and acne. And so, after leaving her top job at tech group AOL that year to become a stay-at-home mum to her four children, Kara decided to completely change her lifestyle. She quit drinking manufactured soft drinks, and instead drank only water. She claims that in the space of two-and-a-half weeks her acne cleared up, she got her energy back, and she lost more than 20 pounds (9kg). The sudden improvements came as a shock. ""I really started to pay attention,"" she says. ""I'm a smart person, but I had been fooled by the word 'diet', thinking it was healthier and better for me."" The experience eventually led Kara to create Hint in 2005, a soft drinks business that now enjoys annual sales of more than $100m (£81m). It specialises in bottled water flavoured solely with natural fruit. Its products do not include any added sugar or sweetener. Using savings, she started the company in her kitchen in San Francisco. Her drink wasn't born solely out of a desire to improve her health though. Instead boredom helped to bring it into existence. After Kara had switched to drinking plain water, she got fed up of the taste. To make it more interesting she began adding fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries and pomegranate, and kept a jug of water with fruit pieces in her fridge. She got the idea to turn it into a business after she searched in vain for a bottled version of naturally flavoured water that didn't contain any sweeteners. ""I had this idea, like, 'gosh, why isn't anyone bottling this product?',"" she says. ""I thought if I could actually get people to enjoy water again, instead of drinking all these other things that have not just sugar but diet sweeteners in, then we could actually change health."" Her main challenge was mass producing her flavoured water without adding preservatives or sweeteners. ""Frankly, we had no idea, because the industry didn't have any idea how to develop a product without using preservatives."" She researched how fruit juice is pasteurised to extend its shelf life, and went on to devise a similar technique for her waters, with the help of her husband Theo, a former patents attorney who is now Hint's chief operational officer. ""We were the first fruit water brand to use a pasteurisation product to create our drinks without any kind of preservatives in them,"" she says. But while Kara had successfully worked out now to produce her drink on scale, she realised that she didn't have any experience of running such a company. So she approached one of the global drinks giants to see if it would like to buy her start-up business. She managed to get a phone conversation with a senior executive at the multinational in question, but as she revealed to Forbes magazine back in 2015, the talk did not go very well. Kara says that the man called her ""sweetie"", and that this sexism gave her the drive to continue to run Hint herself, and make a success of it. Her next challenge was how to break into a market dominated by the likes of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, who both own their own water brands and a host of other soft drinks. ""We had no idea of the power of the large soda companies,"" she says. Kara's first step was to persuade her local branch of upmarket supermarket chain Whole Foods to stock Hint. She dropped off a few cases at the shop just hours before she gave birth to her fourth child. They sold out overnight. Her big break though, came thanks to her connections in Silicon Valley. When she first started Hint, she still had one eye on possibly returning to the tech sector, so she attended a job interview at Google. ""I said [at the interview], that I'm really interested in this role, but, unfortunately, I also have another interest."" She then went on to explain her plans for Hint. The Google executive interviewing her suggested that she supply the company with her waters. So she began personally delivering Hint bottles to Google's headquarters.

""Still today we're the largest beverage in Silicon Valley,"" says Kara, who is 51, and was brought up in Arizona. Over the following years Hint steadily expanded beyond Silicon Valley. It says it is now the biggest independently-owned non-alcoholic beverage company in the US. The San Francisco-based business has 200 employees, and its investors include musician John Legend. The drink comes in 26 flavours, including watermelon, peach and blackberry, and there are sparkling and caffeinated versions, and a kids' range. The company has also expanded away from drinks to launch a range of natural sunscreens, and announced plans for a line of deodorants. Kara says she now hopes to expand beyond the US into other countries, including the UK. Alex Beckett, associate director of food and drink at research group Mintel, says that flavoured water has become popular around the world because ""it combines the pure associations and health halo of water, with the interesting flavours found in sugary drinks"". He adds: ""Kara Goldin had the foresight and drive to recognise the long-term potential for flavoured, functional water."" Along with running Hint, Kara says she is focused on raising awareness about health issues, such as rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York But Mr Trump's pride in the numbers is at odds with analysts and investors, who have expressed increasing discomfort over the market's climb. About 65% of investment managers surveyed by Northern Trust last quarter said they believed shares were over-valued, the highest ever in the firm's report. Surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch have expressed alarm about the high prices, as have policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ""We are concerned about equity valuations right now,"" says Mike Morrill, chief operating officer at DF Dent, a Baltimore-based investment company. ""We've had nine years of a strong bull market and that's not going to last forever."" The sentiment is similar to statements Mr Trump himself made before his election, when he said the stock market was ""so bloated"" and warned people to ""be careful"". If investors believe prices are too high - and are buying anyway - that could be a sign of a bubble. So is the stock market rally a reason to cheer, as Mr Trump suggests now? Or could a crash be around the corner? Pride before a fall? Stocks, which have been on a long-term upward trend, surged early in 2017, amid optimism over business-friendly policies endorsed by the Trump administration, such as tax reform. Analysts say that without clear signs of progress on reform in Washington that effect has faded. Now, it's strong corporate revenue and profit growth that are boosting share prices, with gains going to larger, multinational companies. The three major measures - the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq - have climbed between roughly 10% and 17% so far this year, compared with about 6% to 7% during the same period last year. US 'doing well' The Nasdaq has hit a new high more than 40 times this year. Since 2012, the value of the S&P 500 index has almost doubled. ""The stock market hit the highest level it's ever been,"" Mr Trump boasted on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average exceeded 22,000 points on Wednesday morning. ""Our country is doing very well,"" he said. But that hasn't stopped the muttering that the stock market, at least, is due for a correction. Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale University, says share gains reflect optimism about where the economy is heading, but it's an unreliable forecasting tool, and shifts quickly. ""The stock market is mostly psychology,"" he says. ""The fluctuations in it mean that we're in an optimistic mood but we could change and we could change suddenly."" Investors are trying to anticipate what might trigger a change - whether it be rising interest rates, weak consumer spending, developments overseas or something else entirely. Mr Shiller says he thinks Mr Trump himself poses one of the biggest risks. The firestorm in Washington in May after Mr Trump fired former FBI director James Comey prompted some of the biggest one-day share sell-offs this year. ""Usually, presidents are not able to transform the economy unless he does something disastrous, which transforms it down,"" says Mr Shiller. ""I'm thinking that it's more likely he will create some kind of uncertainty, disruption and that might be a trigger for decline."" A new tech bubble? Many of the biggest gains come from a single sector - technology stocks - the same industry that some investors say is overvalued. The S&P 500 information technology index, which averages 68 companies, including heavyweights such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, last month passed the record set in March 2000. The index rose about 22% in the first seven months of 2017, while the broader S&P 500 climbed about 10%. Some say the gains in tech make sense, as investors target a part of the economy seeing rapid growth. However, others worry that in some cases the rise in shares has little to do with the companies' actual prospects. And in more recent weeks, tech stocks have come under pressure. If the sell-off spreads to other sectors, it could be a warning of bigger problems. Jill Hall, a US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, doesn't expect stock markets in general to rise much more this year, but she's not predicting a big sell-off either. She thinks investors will shift their money from the high-growth tech industry into sectors such as energy, health care and finance. ""What we're expecting is more of a rotation out of growth and into value,"" she says. Rate shift Some say they're worried Federal Reserve and central bankers elsewhere will move too aggressively to increase interest rates, causing havoc in bond and stock markets. About 27% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month identified a mistake by central bankers in the US and Europe as the biggest risk to their outlooks. Another 28% were worried about bonds. Mr Trump himself raised alarms on these lines at a presidential debate last year. ""We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,"" he said. ""The only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down."" That's something that is not lost on the central bankers responsible for monetary policy. Last month Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen told a US congressional committee: ""We want to make sure that we manage this in a way that is not disruptive to financial markets."" And that's a sentiment financial markets would no doubt endorse.","For weeks now, US stock markets have been hitting records, a rise claimed by President Donald Trump as proof of a healthy economy."
"The reason is that the European Court of Justice has decided that insurers will no longer be allowed to take the gender of their customers into account when setting their insurance premiums. Up until now, insurers considered gender because - for example - there is a difference between the sexes in life expectancy and the likelihood of road accidents. What is happening? Insurers will no longer be able to charge different premiums to men and women because of their gender following a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The industry was given time to prepare for the change, but the changes have now come into effect. The theory from the ECJ was that taking customers' gender into account contradicted laws on discrimination. In practice, the requirement for unisex premiums is likely to affect the cost of some types of insurance, notably car insurance, life insurance, health insurance, and the cost of an annuity - a financial product that provides a regular pension income. What will this mean for insurance premiums? Lots of figures have been thrown around by groups interested, and at times angry, about this ruling. The likelihood is that there will be some volatility in the prices of insurance for some months as various insurance companies look at how their competitors are changing their charging structures. But many people are likely to notice a change the next time they renew, or shop around for better, insurance. How will drivers be affected? The most obvious shift is likely to be seen for young drivers. There seems to be a general view that young men's premiums will fall a little, perhaps by up to 10%, but young women's will rise more, perhaps by up to 30%. AA Insurance says an annual car insurance bill for a young woman will go up by £400 on average. Will the cost of a regular pension income be affected as dramatically? Women may benefit from higher payments when purchasing retirement income products as they have traditionally been offered lower benefits due to their higher average life expectancies. On retirement, many people buy an annuity - a financial product that guarantees a pension income for the rest of their life. Annuity expert Billy Burrows, of the Better Retirement Group, says a standard annuity bought with a pension pot of £100,000 by somebody aged 65 - male or female - will be £5,803, according to the latest figures. He says the changes resulting from the ruling are age dependent with younger men seeing the biggest cuts and older women the biggest rises. For a man aged 55 the cut in annuity income has been up to 5%, a man aged 60 has seen a cut of 3% and man aged 65 has seen a less than 1% cut. ""It is a complicated picture but overall not as bad we thought and there are signs that some companies are increasing rates,"" Mr Burrows says. The build up to the change in rules created a self-fulfilling prophecy and rates did fall significantly, he says. ""This was not all down to unisex annuity rates, it was partly due to an excess of demand over supply so companies cut rates to reduce business flow and increase margins,"" he says. What about life assurance? On average women live longer and so currently pay less for life assurance than men. Following the ruling, the ABI estimated that men could see a 10% fall in costs, while women's rates could rise by as much as 20%. Again, the industry may only settle down a few weeks after the ruling. Health insurance may also be affected by the changes. What other factors will affect premiums? Obviously, more than just gender is considered when setting an insurance premium, and this will remain the case. Other so-called ""risk factors"" will still affect the thinking of, and pricing by, insurance companies. For example, motor insurance will be higher for the driver whose car has a more powerful engine, and medical insurance could cost more for those with pre-existing conditions. The age of the customer can also still be part of an insurance company's thinking. The rules do not prohibit discrimination on age as they do on gender. What has this meant for the insurance industry? In the short-term it has caused a lot more paperwork for the companies and their customers. Insurers are changing their policy documents, are having to contact their customers, and are updating their computer systems. They must also ensure brokers are giving out the correct price information and marketing is correct. In the longer-term, they will have one less variable to consider when setting prices, but it remains to be seen if this will cut the industry's workload at all. For customers, the advice is to shop around. What will insurers across the rest of Europe do? Most insurers across all EU member states used gender as a factor in their pricing. So, they are having to change the way they calculate premiums in the same way as insurers in the UK.","Men and women, young and old, are set to notice significant changes to the cost of various types of insurance under the new European rules."
"The US aerospace giant said it would continue to build the plane, but not deliver any until US safety officials gave their backing. The US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing are investigating the problem. All 50 of Boeing's 787s have been suspended from flying since an All Nippon Airways flight on Wednesday made an emergency landing due to a fault. ""We will not deliver 787s until the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] approves a means of compliance with their recent Airworthiness Directive concerning batteries and the approved approach has been implemented,"" said a Boeing spokesman. US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said earlier the Dreamliner would not fly again under authorities were ""1,000% sure"" it is safe. A string of issues in recent weeks has raised questions about the 787, which is the first major aircraft grounding since 1979. Dreamliners have suffered incidents including fuel leaks, a cracked cockpit window, brake problems and an electrical fire. However, it is the battery problems that have caused the most concern. Battery inspection This week, US and European aviation regulators said planes should be grounded while safety checks are carried out on their lithium ion batteries. On Friday, US officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board joined the Japanese probe at Takamatsu airport in western Japan. The Japan Transport Safety Board said the battery and the systems around it would be sent to Tokyo for more checks, adding there were similarities with an earlier battery fire on a 787 in Boston operated by Japan Airlines. The pilot of the ANA plane made an emergency landing on Wednesday after he smelled burning and received a cockpit warning of battery problems. All passengers evacuated the plane on emergency slides. The investigation is being led by the Japan Transport Safety Board. Boeing is investing heavily in the 787 Dreamliner, which has been in service since October 2011. Together with European rival Airbus, it dominates the global airliner market.",Boeing has suspended deliveries of its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft until a battery problem is resolved.

"By Caroline BayleyIn Business, BBC Radio 4 Introduced after Russia's intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, sanctions imposed on Russia - and then by Russia in retaliation - are already making life difficult for some UK businesses. At SMD, a specialist engineering firm in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, they make sophisticated robots which operate on the seabed, doing the job of deep-sea divers. These are used for developing oil fields all over the world. SMD relies on its exports, and one fifth of its market is in Russia. That stopped when targeted economic sanctions against Russia by the US and the EU were announced at the end of July. These banned trade with certain sectors in Russia: defence, some banking, and the oil and shale gas industry; as well as with key individuals. Andrew Hodgson, chief executive of SMD, highlights the damage to his business, especially as it can take three to four years to win a major sub-sea contract. ""Imagine we're a 500 employee business and 20% of your business doesn't exist, that's 100 jobs and obviously we've been working hard on the technology,"" he says. ""We've got a number of significant projects in the pipeline, which we've been working on over a number of years with Russia, which clearly are just in abeyance now and they've just stopped,"" Mr Hodgson points out. Hidden damage In a typical year SMD would sell £20m pounds worth of equipment in Russia, to both the navy and the off-shore oil industry. Fortunately it is a company with several different export markets, and it expects to maintain its workforce by selling elsewhere. Mr Hodgson says he understands the reasons for the sanctions, but the loss of Russia means the firm won't continue the fast growth and expansion it has seen in the past few years. He claims SMD is not the only company to be hit by these sanctions, and that many others are reticent about admitting the impact these are having. ""I can't quote who they are, but I've been speaking to some of the large players in our sector who provide other equipment, and it's having a significant hit on their business,"" Hodgson says. Russian retaliation But it is not just sanctions imposed by the West that are hitting companies. In August Russia retaliated by banning imports of some agricultural food from the US and the EU. This included mackerel from Scotland. The Scottish mackerel industry has had a long history of trade with Russia, and the Soviet Union before that. Skipper Alex Wiseman, who is also chairman of the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association, says at one time Russia was their only market for mackerel so the import ban came as a huge shock. He says prices for mackerel fell sharply this season as the effect of a larger mackerel fishing quota this year was compounded by the Russian ban. ""We were watching the situation but you never think these things are going to affect you directly,"" says Mr Wiseman. Seeking new buyers At Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, Sinclair Banks is the general manager at Lunar Freezing, a mackerel processor. The firm used to sell 16% of its mackerel to Russia, and has now had to fill that gap. It has now made up much of the shortfall by selling to South East Asian markets instead. ""We had to make a lot of effort to try and get more product into that market,"" says Mr Banks. ""So we had to go to Japan for two weeks, and visit China. Nigeria has been a good market for us as well, Western Europe and Israel [too]. We've sold into all of these countries."" However, he believes selling in Russia in the future will be extremely challenging as the importers there have turned to countries not affected by the ban. ""If the sanctions are lifted it will be difficult to get that market back,"" says Mr Banks. ""The market in Russia has adapted to the product in Faroe, Iceland and Greenland."" More sanctions ahead? So have the sanctions imposed by the EU countries backfired? The foreign office minister for Europe, David Lidington, recognises that some UK companies have indeed been hit. ""There is undoubtedly a cost to us and I don't think anybody from the prime minister down has pretended otherwise, just as there is for German companies, French companies, Italian companies, [and] American companies, whose governments have also introduced sanctions,"" he explains. However he says the sanctions are necessary given Russia's intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. The West, he says could in fact take more action. ""Sanctions could be tightened further - that depends what happens in Russia and Ukraine,"" he warns. ""So far when sanctions have been tightened it has been in response to aggressive action by the Russians or by Russia's reneging upon international agreements she has entered into."" The government, he says, is trying to help those companies which have lost their Russian customers to find new markets. However, there are no guarantees of new contracts and there is no financial help on offer. In Business is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 on Thursday, 27 November and is repeated at 21:30 on Sunday, 30 November.

"By Simon JackBusiness editor Small businesses are the clear winners from the Budget with big businesses picking up the bill - and then some. The biggest beef for small businesses are rates, which far exceed the amount they pay in corporation tax, and there were hopes they would be reduced. Mr Osborne has obliged, announcing 630,000 small businesses will pay no business rates at all from next year. He claims the reduction will save £7bn per year for businesses. The bill for that will fall to big corporations. Big firms face a crackdown on practices which reduce taxable profits, including offsetting debt interest against profits and using losses in one year to offset profits in another. The government says this combination of measures will raise £9bn. Yet in the past, measures to crack down on tax avoidance have had mixed success and the chancellor is relying heavily on it to fund his small business initiatives. Businesses big and small will be grateful he didn't raise fuel duty. The ""feel good factor"" that creates is at least as important as the threat of a Tory backbench riot. However, these trades between big and small are all overshadowed by the central view of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that the single most important measure of an economy - its productivity growth - looks permanently damaged. That's the big economic picture and it is not a pretty one.",George Osborne has often thought big when writing his Budget speech - this time he thought small.
"Shares have also been hit. The FTSE 100 index began the day by falling more than 8%, then regained some ground to stand 2.5% lower.

""The markets despise uncertainty, yet that is exactly what they're faced with this morning. The shockwaves are likely to reverberate for some time and the warning lights are flashing brighter now than ever."" The FTSE 100's initial slump was its biggest one-day fall since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008. UK government bond yields hit a new record low, with 10-year yields down more than 30 basis points to 1.018%, according to Reuters data. Two-year yields fell more than 20 basis points to their lowest levels since mid-2013, at 0.233%. The impact of the vote was also felt in other European countries. The Frankfurt and Paris indexes were both down more than 7% and 8% respectively, while the Swiss central bank intervened on the money markets to steady the Swiss franc after it appreciated in value. Oil prices have also fallen sharply in the wake of the referendum outcome, with Brent crude down 4.6%. The price of Brent crude fell by $2.34 to $48.57 a barrel, its biggest fall since February. At the same time, US crude was down 4.4%, or $2.22, to $47.89 a barrel. 'Once-in-a-lifetime moves' Before the results started to come in, the pound had risen as high as $1.50, as traders bet on a Remain victory. But following early strong Leave votes in north-east England, it tumbled to $1.43 and then took another dive after 03:00 BST as Leave maintained its lead. The move in sterling is the biggest one-day fall ever seen. A weaker pound buys fewer dollars or other foreign currencies, which makes it more expensive to buy products from abroad. However, it should benefit exporters as it makes their goods cheaper abroad. Against the euro, the pound dropped 7% to about €1.2085. By Friday lunchtime, it had risen again but was still 5.3% down on the day. At one point, the euro was 3.3% lower against the dollar, its biggest one-day fall since the currency's inception. Currency traders say these moves are more extreme than those seen during the financial crisis of 2008. ""Leave's victory has delivered one of the biggest market shocks of all time,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. ""The pound has collapsed to its lowest level in over 30 years, suffering its biggest one-day fall in living memory. ""Panic may not be too strong a word - the pound could have further to go over the next couple of days as markets digest the news. ""It's fair to say we've never seen anything like it and the chances are markets will remain highly volatile over the coming hours and days."" IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia, issued a statement saying the result of the vote would hit its profits. ""Following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while IAG continues to expect a significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015,"" it said. 'Contingency plans' David Tinsley at UBS said there would be ""a significant rise in economic uncertainty"" and that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was expected to take action, including interest rate cuts and an extension of its quantitative easing programme. ""We expect the MPC will cut policy rates to zero and make further asset purchases, in the first instance of £50-75bn, not later than February 2017,"" he said. In a statement, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the Bank would ""pursue relentlessly"" its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability, which were unchanged. He said the Bank had put in place ""extensive contingency plans"" to mitigate the risks associated with the referendum, adding that it stood ready to provide more than £250bn of additional funds to banks through its normal facilities. ""In the coming weeks, the Bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses,"" he said. The European Central Bank (ECB) also issued a statement saying it was closely monitoring financial markets and was in close contact with other central banks. ""The ECB stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies,"" it added. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, said the Fund had taken note of the referendum decision. ""We urge the authorities in the UK and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the UK and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process,"" she added.

"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News Yet in this murky sea of unwanted electronic communication, a fast-growing phenomenon has floated to the surface during 2010. Social buying sites, such as Groupon, BuyWithMe and LivingSocial, offer discount deals on everything from sky-diving and fish pedicures to teeth whitening and restaurant meals. During the last year or so, they have won over millions of sceptical customers in cities across the world and their expansion is set to continue at a rapid pace into next year. Investor endorsement The sites' ballooning customer bases have attracted major cash-injections from household names, with other eagle-eyed investors eager to get involved. Google recently had a $6bn (£3.9bn) offer for market leader Groupon turned down and is currently on the prowl looking for other social buying takeover targets - soon after it linked up with eBay for a cross-marketing initiative. LivingSocial recently secured a $175m investment from Amazon, reportedly valuing the company at $1bn. Social buying executives see investor interest as endorsement of their business model. ""It has legs and it looks sustainable,"" insists Eric Eichman, chief operating officer of LivingSocial. 'Media model' Various social buying sites operate in slightly different ways, but they all deliver customers to retailers in return for a cut of the total revenue, and they build customer bases by offering good deals. ""We offer the consumer a great deal they can't get anywhere else and deliver the sales directly to the merchant,"" explains Rob Solomon, Groupon president and chief operating officer. BuyWithMe says it ""connects savvy shoppers with the best deals and offers from local businesses in their city"", while Groupon says ""collective buying"" enables it to ""offer deals that make it very difficult to say no"". ""Think of it as a media model,"" says LivingSocial's Mr Eichman. ""Customers will stay as long as the deals are good."" Daily discounts LivingSocial's business model is typical. The visible side of its business is easy enough to grasp. Localised daily e-mail offers go out to subscribers in 125 cities around the world. The discounts are valid for 24 hours, until the next e-mail is sent. Customers tempted by a deal - for instance, a 53% discount on a River Thames speedboat tour - pay Living Social the £23 discounted price in return for a voucher. ""You're buying today, but you don't have to use the service tomorrow,"" explains Mr Eichman, pointing out that typically the voucher will be valid for a year. LivingSocial will then pay the merchant directly, after taking a cut. ""We share the proceeds,"" Mr Eichman says. That cut is basically the price that the merchant pays to get access to LivingSocial's customer base - though they only pay if customers actually buy something. ""It's the ultimate in performance-measured advertising,"" Mr Eichman insists. 'Customer acquisition' LivingSocial's cost side is equally simple. It pays its 550 members of staff (up from just 10 a year ago) to develop and operate the technology - basically a website with a payment facility and daily e-mails to those on its database - and to sign up retailers and service providers willing to offer attractive discounts. ""Our mix of deals needs to be diverse enough to be interesting,"" says Mr Eichman. ""If it's not a great deal, it's not going to work. And if it doesn't work, it's bad all around - for the merchant, for our members and for us."" Good deals on their own are not enough to build a large customer base, however. In fact, explains Mr Eichman, ""customer acquisition"" - through advertising, for instance - represents the company's biggest cost. ""Once you build the list, you can get the merchants,"" he reasons, pointing to how it slowly creates a virtuous spiral. Simple and lucrative Companies such as Google and Amazon could bring different things to the table. As a retailer, Amazon could bring deals to customers, or a customer base to LivingSocial's merchants. For its part, Google could bring loyal followers to sales-hungry retailers and service providers. ""Google has a strong relationship with consumers, but they don't have a commercial relationship with consumers,"" observes Mr Eichman. So interest in the social buying outfits from large online operators is expected to grow dramatically in 2011 - a year when competition will probably also heat up as operators such as Groop Swoop, TownHog and eWinWin continue to expand, along with ever more new entrants. Mr Eichman insists barriers to entry have already come up, with newcomers finding it difficult to sign up both merchants and customers. But given that the business model is both simple and lucrative, it seems likely that many will have a go.","In a time when most people's inboxes are filled with spam e-mails offering supposedly ""special deals"", it would be natural to expect serious companies to steer clear of such annoying marketing efforts."
"Lawrence Buterman made the claim while speaking at the opening of a trial into price-fixing allegations against the iPad and iPhone maker. He said a rise in e-book prices after the launch of the iPad in 2010 was the result of a deliberate scheme. However, Apple's lawyer described the prosecution's case as ""bizarre"". Defence lawyer Orin Snyder said the government had ""reverse engineered a conspiracy"" by linking price rises to Apple's deals with the publishers. The technology giant has claimed that it acted in its own business interests when it made deals with publishers to supply e-books it sold through its iBooks platform. Apple encouraged publishers to set the price of their e-books, rather than allowing retailers to decide the price. Prosecutors say this was aimed at Amazon - a rival e-book retailer that charged lower prices than Apple was able to offer. They say that, as a result, Amazon's typical price of $9.99 for a best-seller rose to $12.99 or $14.99 after the launch of the iPad. But Mr Snyder disputed this, and argued that Apple could not be held responsible for the business decisions of others.

"The airline will also ban passengers from eating nut products if somebody on board has an allergy to them. Nut policy among airlines differs. British Airways and Ryanair, ask passengers to refrain from eating peanuts if a fellow passenger has an allergy. At present there are no rules governing the serving of nuts during flights. A proposed UK passenger charter, which could include rules for protecting allergy sufferers, is currently under consultation. The plans are part of the government's Aviation 2050 strategy. German carrier Lufthansa is among firms with a rule against serving peanuts on its planes. However, like most airlines, it says it cannot guarantee a nut-free environment. Outlining the new policy, Easyjet said: ""We recommend that passengers inform us of their allergy at the time of booking which enables us to pass this information onto the cabin crew operating the flight."" Passengers can also notify the airline during the online booking process. An overarching policy for airlines is supported by 11 year-old Josie, who would like to see nuts banned by all operators. Josie, from Wolviston in Stockton-on-Tees, worries about going on holiday due to her life-threatening nut allergy. She carries an EpiPen with her on flights but says they only delay an anaphylactic reaction by a few minutes. ""You cannot do anything if you are 30,000 feet in the air,"" she said.",Easyjet has banned the sale of nuts on flights to help protect passengers with allergies.
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Fifteen countries, including the US, India and New Zealand, have been setting out Brexit concerns at a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Geneva. Australian officials said their beef and lamb exporters had already been hit after several Brexit delays. Brazil said Brexit plans for Northern Ireland could breach WTO rules. The main issue for the 15 countries is a system which allows them easier access to the EU's large market for limited quantities of some of their goods, mainly farm produce. It's a system known as ""tariff rate quotas"". World Trade Organization members generally apply tariffs - taxes on imports - to many of the goods they buy from abroad. For some products they have made commitments to allow specified amounts to be imported with tariffs that are lower than what they usually apply. In some cases the reduced tariff is zero. It makes it more profitable for Australian farmers to sell beef to Europe, for example. Brexit complicates this. The current quotas are for the whole of the EU, the UK included. Brexit means the UK and the EU have to decide how to divide them up. Some countries say that could lead to them having less of the favourable access than they currently have to what is a large and wealthy market. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""We have set out our Goods Schedule at the WTO to maintain the existing balance of rights and obligations between the UK and our trading partners. ""The UK has entered into negotiations with affected countries under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Article XXVIII process to maintain the current balance of rights and obligations."" Australia said that the UK and EU had proposed different ways of allocating the quotas that would add up to less access than Australian exporters currently have. The US argued that it could end up with no access at reduced tariffs for pizza cheese to the UK or grape juice to the EU. Another concern is that the UK and EU might themselves end up using part or even all of the other's quota. The US argued that could severely hit its sales of pork and wine. Some countries are demanding compensation from the UK and EU. In the WTO that would usually mean reducing tariffs on other goods. Brexit delays Australia also argued that it has already been affected by Brexit. A paper prepared for the meeting said that when Brexit was still scheduled for 31 October, many Australian businesses ceased exports of valuable beef and sheep meat ahead of Christmas because of uncertainty about whether they would be able to make use of these quotas. The document said similar decisions were taken ahead of a previous possible Brexit dates and will have to be taken again before 31 January. Ireland question Brazil has raised another concern about the plans for customs procedures between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Brazilian officials said it could violate the WTO's rules against discrimination. The documents the BBC has seen don't spell out the reason for this, but it is probably based on the plans to have an open border between Northern Ireland in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in the EU. Combined with the plans for limited checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, it might provide an opportunity for goods to travel between the UK and EU without restrictions or possibly tariffs that would apply to similar goods from the rest of the world. Brazilian officials said it was paramount that the WTO's non-discrimination principle is preserved. It was not clear, they argued, that the proposed arrangements for Northern Ireland would guarantee that would happen.",Countries including Australia have asked for trade compensation from the UK and the EU over Brexit disruption.
