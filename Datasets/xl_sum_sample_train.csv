"By Rebecca Ricks & Johnny O'SheaBBC Spotlight The first diagnosis at the 36-bed home in Tregony near Truro was on 30 March and coronavirus tore through the home over the next few weeks. Staffing levels were down by 50%, with some of the carers not going home to their own families for more than two months. In the summer, garden visits were introduced for family members and now, with rapid testing on site, residents can finally touch and hug their loved ones again. It has been a tumultuous nine months, but they are now looking forward to Christmas. Here are three perspectives from those closest to the home, which has won a Care Heroes Award for its work during the pandemic. The manager ""We were all frightened at the beginning. We didn't know quite what we were dealing with"", Michelle Wray, the registered manager of Roseland Court, said. Mrs Wray called the virus the ""invisible enemy"". ""We didn't know how it was coming in, or how it was spreading,"" she said. ""I can't even put it into words how it felt at that time. It felt like we were losing our own family one by one. ""As the staff we just held on to each other. Lots of tears, lots of laughter and just knowing that we were doing the best that we could just kept us all going through."" 'Quite horrific' The emotional strain was ""the toughest"" when, at the end of a resident's life, staff had to make ""goodbye calls"" to families unable to visit. ""It got really really bad in the fact that it was not just one person we lost a day. And to deal with one person passing and the emotions that invokes - to do that two or three times in one day was quite horrific."" Some staff lived at the care home for up to two months without seeing their own families because they had a vulnerable relative at home. ""The distress that they coped with, the dealing with loved ones. They are the ones who have blown me away with their absolute dedication,"" said Mrs Wray. The home is now using lateral flow testing for visitors, which means there ""is the light at the end of the tunnel now"". ""We have surprised several of the residents with visits from their loved ones. So the last few weeks there hasn't been a dry eye in the house, but all happy tears now."" The carer Clinical lead Julie Barton said some of those she cared for have been confused and angry at times during the last nine months, especially in the early stages of the pandemic. ""They were angry that their loved ones couldn't be with them at the most important time of their life, which was the end of their life,"" she said. Mrs Barton was with several residents as they died. She said: ""I felt privileged as we always do when we are with somebody at that moment, when they are at the end of their life."" She is now working on making the most of the festive season for those at the home, and says the recent visits from family members have been ""truly wonderful"". The families One resident, Jean Biddick, 93 had not seen any of her three children since February until a recent visit. She said: ""I missed my children. They phone every day but I missed them. I couldn't believe it when my daughter walked in yesterday, because I didn't know nothing about it."" Katie Wood's mother moved into Roseland Court in February and was not allowed any visitors for the first few months. In the summer, some outdoor visits were arranged with screens and social distancing in place, and now the home is allowing visitors to have direct contact with their loved ones, as long as they test negative for Covid on arrival at the home. She said: ""I was one of the first people that was able to come in and see her which was very emotional but it was very lovely too. ""It's just that contact and being able to touch. To get up close to them and give them a hug.""","During the spring, at the height of the Covid-19 crisis, Roseland Court care home in Cornwall lost more than a third of its residents to the virus."
"By Rachel SchraerBBC Reality Check So, why did the family have to go to court to decide what care she receives? What's happened in Tafida's case? Tafida Raqeeb suffered a traumatic brain injury in February as a result of a rare condition. She has arteriovenous malformation, where a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between the arteries and veins risks causing a ruptured vessel. Tafida's mother, Shelina Begum, and her father, Mohammed Raqeeb, wanted to seek treatment in Italy. But the Royal London Hospital, which is caring for their daughter, said releasing her was not in her best interests. A spokesperson for Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said that its clinicians and independent medical experts had found ""further medical treatment would not improve her condition"". It said it was in Tafida's best interests to withdraw treatment. Can hospitals overrule parents? In England and Wales the concept of parental responsibility is set out in law, in the Children Act 1989. This gives parents the responsibility broadly to decide what happens to their child, including the right to consent to medical treatment. But this right is not absolute. If a public body considers that a parent's choices are not in the best interests of their child, and an agreement cannot be reached, it can challenge these choices by going to court. A judge makes the final decision, based on the evidence available. The law does not consider either doctors or parents to be automatically right - instead, it says that the best interests of the child are the deciding factor. A judge will have heard evidence about Tafida's clinical condition, the impact of moving her and the possibility of further treatment having any success, in order to decide the best course of action. At the High Court, Mr Justice MacDonald said ""life-sustaining treatment"" for Tafida must continue. He dismissed Barts NHS Trust's application to withdraw life support. Has this happened before? Two recent high-profile cases - of babies Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans - also tested the limits of parents' rights to decide what happens to their sick children. Unlike the case of Tafida, both sets of parents lost their cases and were not able to move their children abroad for treatment. Charlie was born on 4 August 2016 with an exceptionally rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) which left him with severe brain damage, partial paralysis and unable to breathe unaided. His parents wanted to take him to the US for experimental treatment, but the hospital treating him felt his life support should be switched off and he should be allowed to die with dignity. Charlie's case eventually reached the highest UK court, the Supreme Court, which ruled that it was likely that Charlie would ""suffer significant harm if his present suffering was prolonged without any realistic prospect of improvement"". His parents applied to appeal this decision in the European Court of Human Rights - which is not part of the EU. The European court said it would defer to the decision of the UK court, and ruled the appeal inadmissible. Charlie died days later. In the case of Alfie, there was no suggestion of new treatment - his parents wanted to transfer him to a hospital in Italy in order to prolong his life on ventilation. He had a degenerative neurological condition and had been in a semi-vegetative state for most of his life. Alfie died at the age of 23 months after a judge ruled that doctors could stop providing life support, against his parents' wishes, In Tafida's case, the lawyer representing her family said there was ""no evidence"" she would suffer pain or harm from being moved. But the NHS trust had said further treatment would be ""invasive"" and ""futile"". Could things change? At the moment, medical teams can lawfully refuse treatment if they can prove it is not in a child's best interests. Charlie's parents are campaigning for a change in the law which they have dubbed Charlie's Law. They want doctors to have to prove a child would be at risk of ""significant harm"" as a result of the treatment. This test is already used in other areas of child law, for example if a local authority applies to the courts to remove an at-risk child from its parents. Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, says she also wants mediation to be provided to help doctors and parents come to a decision together without going to court.

"Anneliese Dodds will now become the Labour Party's chair - replacing deputy leader Angela Rayner, whom Sir Keir fired from the role on Saturday. Ms Rayner will instead replace Rachel Reeves in shadowing Michael Gove at the Cabinet Office, as Ms Reeves is promoted to the shadow chancellor role. The Labour leader chaired a meeting of the shadow cabinet on Monday. Sources said Sir Keir told them there was no escaping the scale of the defeats which said ""something profound about the size of the journey we have to go"". He was said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Sir Keir said that his deputy, Ms Rayner, had ""a big, new role, taking the fight to the Tories"". She later tweeted that she was ""looking forward to rolling my sleeves up and getting to work"" in order to ""reconnect with the voters that have lost faith in the Labour Party, especially in our traditional heartlands"". But the reshuffle, announced late on Sunday following hours of wrangling behind closed doors, is already facing criticism from figures within the party. The moves came after Labour lost control of eight councils overall in English local elections, and suffered an historic defeat to the Conservatives at a by-election in Hartlepool. The party fared better in Wales, where it won half the seats in Welsh Parliament elections, as well as in several mayoral races in England. Labour also took the West of England and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral posts off the Tories, and prevailed in the first race for the new West Yorkshire mayor. Labour MP and former actress Tracy Brabin - the first woman to become a metro mayor - has stepped down from her role in Westminster to take up the new post. But this means the party will soon face another by-election in her seat of Batley and Spen, which has been held by Labour since 1997. Labour was also re-elected in Greater Manchester, where its successful mayoral candidate Andy Burnham urged the party to learn the lessons of its victories. He added that the party was too focused on a ""civil war"" between figures from different factions, which would prove ""absolutely pointless and destructive."" Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, Shabana Mahmood, has taken on Ms Rayner's other former role as campaign coordinator. She told BBC Breakfast the party had to ""immerse ourselves in the communities that we currently represent - and that we want to represent once again - and to earn their trust"". But Ms Rayner remains deputy leader of the party as it is an elected post voted for by members - and will be given additional duties to focus on the future of work and ""levelling up"". Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbot hit out at the ""drawn-out"" reshuffle, which she said ""hasn't been fantastically successful"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said Ms Rayner's removal from her campaign role was a sign Sir Keir was trying to make her ""carry the can for the poor results"". And Labour's Liverpool Riverside MP Kim Johnson called the decision a ""despicable act of cowardice"" from the Labour leader. An ally of Ms Rayner said she had come out ""significantly more powerful, both in terms of the party and policy"", while a Labour insider told the BBC: ""Who would want to be national campaign coordinator in name only with no power when you're just made the scapegoat for the failures of Keir's team?"" In response to the change in role, Ms Rayner tweeted: ""I will work tirelessly to reform our party and deliver a policy agenda that will enable us to reconnect with the voters that we need to win, especially in our traditional heartlands, and show that the Labour Party speaks for the working class."" She also thanked ""friends from all across the Labour Party and our movement"" who had contacted her over the weekend, adding: ""United we stand, divided we fall."" Sir Keir Starmer's first reshuffle has been a very messy affair. It began badly with a bust up with his deputy, Angela Rayner, who was being moved from one of her roles - in charge of campaigns. Her allies said she was being sacked. Sir Keir's team said she was being moved. They can't both be telling the whole truth. But there was a late night howl of backlash to the notion she was being ousted, putting pressure on the leader to find a way to make her stay. Read more from Laura here. Other movements in the reshuffle include: Lisa Nandy is expected to remain as shadow foreign secretary, while Jonathan Ashworth will stay in his role as shadow health secretary. A spokesman for Mr Brown - who was chief whip under five Labour leaders - said the MP thought it was ""a reasonable time for Nick to move on"", adding he and Sir Keir had ""parted on good terms, with mutual respect"". The party confirmed there would be no further appointments announced.",Sir Keir Starmer has sacked his shadow chancellor in a shake-up of his team after poor election results in England.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Vinyl sales made the record industry £2.4m, while downloads took in £2.1m, the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) said. It marks a big shift in music consumption. In the same week last year, vinyl albums made £1.2m while digital ones made £4.4m. Downloads have been in sharp decline as consumers switch to streaming services. The ERA has suggested the surge in vinyl sales could be attributed to the popularity of vinyl as a Christmas gift and the growing number of retailers - including supermarkets such as Sainsbury's and Tesco - which now stock vinyl. ""This is yet further evidence of the ability of music fans to surprise us all,"" said ERA chief Kim Bayley. ""It's not so long ago that the digital download was meant to be the future. Few would have predicted that an album format, first invented in 1948 and based on stamping a groove into a piece of plastic, would now be outselling it in 2016."" However, it is worth noting that vinyl albums are priced much higher than downloads. Last week's biggest-selling vinyl was Kate Bush's triple-disc live album Before The Dawn, which retails at £52. A download of the same recording is available for £12. All of which means that downloads are still the more popular product. According to the ERA, 120,000 vinyl albums were sold last week, compared with 295,000 digital ones. Nonetheless, the ""vinyl revival"" has been one of the most surprising success stories of the digital music era. The format has now shown eight consecutive years of growth since facing near extinction in 2007, although it still represents less than 2% of the overall music market. Earlier this year, a BBC/ICM poll found that people who listened to music on streaming services were more likely to buy vinyl - often as a goodwill gesture to an artist they loved. But 48% of those surveyed said they did not play the vinyl they bought - while 7% did not even own a turntable. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Disney's Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which sees Johnny Depp returning for his fifth appearance as Captain Jack Sparrow, was expected to go into production next year. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer told the Hollywood Reporter issues with the script and budget caused the delay. He said he was now targeting a summer 2016 release. ""We have an outline everyone loves but the script is not done,"" Bruckheimer said, adding: ""We want a script that everyone's signed off on and a budget that everyone's signed off on."" The delay follows the poor performance by Disney's much anticipated summer film The Lone Ranger, also starring Depp, which earned just $29m (£18m) in its opening weekend in the US. The film, which reportedly cost $215m (£136m) to make, has grossed $243m (£154m) worldwide to date. Disney warned the film would amount to losses of between $160m-$190m (£104m-£124m) after heavy spending on promotion failed to bring returns. Bruckheimer said coming up with a great script was ""always hard,"" and after this summer - which saw several blockbuster films perform poorly - ""everybody's more cautious"". The most recent Pirates instalments, At World's End and On Stranger Tides, were both released in time for Memorial Day weekend in September 2007 and 2011. Disney previously announced the fifth Pirates film will be directed by Kon-Tiki filmmakers Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg. The four films in the franchise have grossed a combined total of $3.7bn (£2.3bn) worldwide, making Pirates Of The Caribbean the fifth biggest film franchise ever.",The next Pirates of the Caribbean film has been delayed beyond its planned 2015 release.
"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter Effectively, the President of the United States was calling for a high pay cap of, in today's money, just under $400,000 or £330,000. Interviewed this morning on the Today programme, Jeremy Corbyn rekindled the debate on high pay, saying that a ""cap"" should be considered for the highest earners. With legislation if necessary. Given that a direct limit (making it ""illegal"" for example for anyone to earn over, say, £200,000) would be almost impossible to enforce in a global economy where income takes many forms - salary, investments, returns on assets - very high marginal rates of tax could be one way to control very high levels of pay. Another could be by imposing limits on the pay ratio between higher and lower earners in a company - possibly a more politically palatable option. The High Pay Centre, for example, supports considering this approach. Their research reveals the ratio has increased substantially. ""The average pay of a FTSE 100 chief executive has rocketed from around £1m a year in the late 1990s - about 60 times the average UK worker - to closer to £5m today, more than 170 times,"" the organisation said in 2014. In its submission to the review of corporate governance by the House of Commons business select committee in October, the centre said executive pay was ""out of control"". It is only relatively recently that high marginal rates of tax have been dropped as a way of limiting ""out of control"" pay. Although America's Congress couldn't quite stomach the wartime 100% super tax (the actor Ann Sheridan commented ""I regret that I have only one salary to give to my country"") by 1945 the marginal rate on incomes over $200,000 was 94%. Post-war, very high rates of income tax on high earners were the norm and income inequality was far lower. By the 1970s in the UK, the marginal rate on higher incomes was 84%, a figure that rose to 98% with the introduction of a surcharge on investment income. Denis Healey, then the Labour chancellor, famously said he wanted to ""squeeze the rich until the pips squeak"" - a quote he subsequently denied. The mood changed with economic stagnation, industrial strife and the arrival of mainstream monetarism and its political leaders - Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. They built an economic and political philosophy based on a belief that it wasn't the state's job to spend, in Thatcher's famous phrase, ""other people's money"" - it was better to allow people to retain the money they earned and spend it as they saw fit, even if it was an awful lot. Lower levels of income tax were the result and economic growth strengthened for a period. Income inequality also grew, maybe a price worth paying for the economic riches which, it was argued, were flowing around the country. For many, especially since the financial crisis, the pendulum has swung back, away from lower taxes towards a more punitive approach to high incomes. Mr Corbyn was speaking about a belief that some individuals at the top of the income scale now have far too much money to spend compared with the ""just about managing"" classes. Theresa May has also made it clear that ""fat cat pay"" is on her radar. The economics of high pay and whether it should be limited are based on a judgement between two competing interests. Tax or not? The first is summed up by the Laffer Curve, popularised by the US economist Arthur Laffer, which argues that if income taxes are too high (or pay limits in any guise too strong) they reduce the incentive to work, which ultimately affects growth, national wealth and government income. At its most basic, under the ""Laffer rules"" a 0% income tax rate would collect no revenue. And a 100% income tax rate would also collect no revenue, as no one would bother working. It has been used from Reagan onwards as the economic underpinning for an argument that lower taxes support growth. In the 1980s, US government revenues increased as taxes were cut, although that was as much to do with general strong levels of growth as it was to do with the tax cuts themselves. The second, contrary, economic pressure, as countless studies from the World Bank and others have shown, is that countries with high levels of income inequality have lower levels of growth. Tackling that inequality, by whatever method, incentivises people to work more effectively. The problem is that lifting lower wages by increasing, for example, productivity levels, could be a more effective way of reducing the gap between low and high pay, although it would take many years of concerted effort to be successful. Since the 1970s, the notion of a government inspired ""incomes policy"" has been - in the popularity stakes - right up there with multi-millionaire bankers at a meeting of Momentum, the organisation that supports Mr Corbyn's Labour leadership. But, ever since the introduction of the minimum wage in the 1990s, the government has made it clear that the amount people are paid is not simply a matter for private businesses and the free market. Mr Corbyn has said he wants to consider a national maximum wage. Many might nod in agreement. How to do it, though, and whether it is economically helpful for growth, is a very different matter.","In 1942, Franklin D Roosevelt - not known as a Socialist radical, though he had his moments - proposed that anyone earning over $25,000 should be taxed at 100%."
"By Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland education correspondent An informal ballot carried out by the EIS showed 93% of secondary staff who took part backed potential action. The EIS blamed the new qualifications system for increasing demands on staff. EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said teachers ""have had enough"". The Scottish government said industrial action ""would not be in the interests of anyone"". The EIS supports the new qualifications - but has long warned about workload, bureaucracy and stress. One concern is about so-called over-assessment. The union said efforts to deal with workloads had not done enough to help - and balloted its members to get an idea of whether they would be prepared to take industrial action. Of those who returned ballot papers, 93% (7,175) said they would. 'Depth of anger' The union has now called for more talks with the Scottish government and the Scottish Qualifications Authority. If the talks are not successful, there could be a legally-standing vote in the new year followed by a boycott of any additional work related to the qualifications. Larry Flanagan said: ""This overwhelming result demonstrates the depth of anger and frustration that secondary teachers are experiencing in relation to excessive qualifications workload. ""Assessment overload, particularly in relation to National 5 and National 6 Unit Assessments and SQA verification procedures, continues to place a huge strain on pupils and teachers alike. ""Action is needed, and quickly, to reduce this unsustainable workload burden."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We note the result of this indicative ballot, and will certainly continue our detailed discussions with the EIS and other partners to make improvements to how our qualifications work, in the interests of Scotland's young people. ""These discussions will fully address issues of teacher workload. ""Industrial action would not be in the interests of anyone, least of all children and parents.""",Scotland's largest teaching union has warned that industrial action over increased workloads is a step closer.
"He made the remarks alongside his wife, Meghan, in a US television broadcast. A spokesperson for the couple said the comments did not refer to any specific political party or candidate, but were instead ""a call for decency"". Voting for the next US president, with candidates including Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, is on 3 November. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared in a live video in what appeared to be their California home as part of the Time 100 - a list compiled by Time magazine to celebrate the world's most influential people. It was their first joint TV appearance since they ceased being working members of the Royal Family in March. ""As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity,"" the duke said as he sat on a bench alongside Meghan. He also reminded Americans to be discerning in the content they consumed online. ""When the bad outweighs the good, for many, whether we realise it or not, it erodes our ability to have compassion and our ability to put ourself in someone else's shoes,"" he said. ""Because when one person buys into negativity online, the effects are felt exponentially. It's time to not only reflect, but act."" 'You deserve to be heard' The 36-year-old duke said he would not be voting in the election because he was not a US citizen, adding that he had never voted in UK elections either. Members of the Royal Family traditionally do not vote, and the Queen is politically neutral. Although UK law does not ban royalty from voting, it is considered unconstitutional for them to do so. Harry and Meghan stepped aside from their roles as senior working royals in March in a bid for personal and financial freedom. They now live in the US but are still members of the Royal Family. Analysis By Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent When Harry and Meghan ceased to be working royals back in March, the official ""divorce"" statement read: ""While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty."" It is Harry's contribution to the Time video message which seems to have attracted the most comment. His spokesman is clear that the duke was making a ""non-partisan call for decency"". But with the Trump administration commonly accused of the traits called out by Harry - ""hate speech, misinformation and online negativity""- his contribution has been widely interpreted as party political. The expectation is that royals remain neutral and the question troubling many people today is whether that means Harry's words are incompatible with the statement issued by the palace in March. It was always going to be difficult to work a way through their royal/non-royal status to the satisfaction of the Sussexes and the Royal Family, as this latest episode once again makes clear. Reacting to the couple's remarks, Royal biographer Robert Jobson said: ""They are not carrying out public duties, live abroad and are really completely detached from our monarchical system now so what difference would it make? ""Meghan, after all, holds American citizenship and has always voted. The business about royals not getting involved in politics is less clear when it comes to Meghan or what the protocol should be in this case. ""But as she is now back living in her country I am sure many would think it wrong that she is not allowed to exercise her democratic right to vote."" However, Mr Jobson said ""it would be better"" for Prince Harry to withdraw from the line of succession ""to avoid further confusion"". And if they were to leave their royal titles behind it may set the duchess ""free to pursue a political career,"" he added. But former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said Prince Harry should not have remarked on the US election as he is still a ""representative"" of the UK. There was ""no problem"" with a ""private citizen"" expressing their views, he said, ""the problem is Harry still has his HRH status"". ""He wants his foot in both camps,"" said the author of the book And What Do You Do? What The Royal Family Don't Want You To Know. The duchess, who mocked then-Republican candidate Mr Trump during a 2016 television appearance, said in the video that the November poll was the ""most important election of our lifetime"". ""When we vote, our values are put into action and our voices are heard. Your voice is a reminder that you matter, because you do and you deserve to be heard,"" she said. A spokesperson for the couple said: ""His message is not in reference to any specific political party or candidate, but is instead a call for decency in how we engage with each other, interact, and consume information - especially online."" A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: ""We would not comment. The duke is not a working member of the Royal Family and any comments he makes are made in a personal capacity.""","Prince Harry has urged US citizens to ""reject hate speech"" and vote in the country's upcoming presidential election."
"The tokens, which can be worn on a lanyard or carried, are a hardware version of its existing contact-tracing app which was rolled out in March. Like the app, they use Bluetooth to look for other users' devices and then log any contact with those devices. They could be popular with older people who do not use smart phones. The government also hopes the tokens will help to further reopen the economy, by enabling conferences to restart and providing better tracing in higher risk settings, such as busy hotels, cinemas and gyms. The initial rollout is happening in areas with a greater concentration of elderly people, who are both at a greater health risk from Covid-19 and less likely to own a smart phone. But the token will be available to all citizens, including foreign residents. Singapore residents currently check-in to shops and office buildings using a separate SafeEntry system, that makes use of QR codes to log users' presence. For some higher-risk activities, SafeEntry will now also require the app or token to check in. Better for privacy? A consultant tapped by the government's technology agency to provide feedback on the token said it's a better option for anyone concerned about privacy. ""I would prefer to use the token over the app,"" said Bunnie Huang, who lined up for a token on the first day it was available. Like app, information is stored on the token, purged regularly and is only uploaded - or in the case of the token physically handed over - to the Ministry of Health if the user tests positive. The tokens can be carried on a lanyard or in a bag, and don't require a smart phone to run. The advantage to a hardware-only version, said Mr Huang, is that it makes it impossible for a software update to surreptitiously turn on location data or other sensors without the user noticing. ""With the token, if I want it off, I know how to destroy it,"" he said. The token will also help to cover people without a smart phone, and those who have encountered functionality problems with the app, he said. Apps around the world Singapore was the first government to introduce a contact tracing app nationally in March. Since then, about 2.4 million people have downloaded the app, with about 1.4 million using it in August. Singapore government figures have long acknowledged that those numbers need to increase to make the app and the token effective. But the Ministry of Health said the program has helped to reduce the time it takes to identify and quarantine close contacts of Covid-19 cases from four days to two. The city-state has been more enthusiastic about contact tracing apps than many other countries, which have been slower to introduce apps or have struggled to make good use of them. England and Wales, for example, won't introduce their app until later this month, while Australia has struggled to get any information from the app that it didn't get by regular contact tracing.",Singapore has started distributing Bluetooth contact-tracing tokens to its five million residents to help contain the spread of Covid-19.
"The scheme would see a large new Marks & Spencer store and a 6,000-seater stadium at Monks Cross. Shop owner Jean Reeves said it was potentially ""devastating"". Developers Oakgate is hosting an exhibition of plans and said it would not comment on the debate. It will be on hand to answer questions at Courtneys Gym, next door to Huntington Stadium on Friday and at the Hilton Hotel, Tower Street, on Saturday, between 1000 and 1500 BST. If approved it would become home to York City Football Club and the York City Knights rugby club. 'Unwelcome to York' Adam Sinclair, chairman of York Chamber of Trade and owner of the Mulberry Hall shop, said the development offered free parking and would pull shoppers out of the city centre. ""Car parking charges [in the city centre] discriminate against shoppers from out of York, which is really rather than welcome to York, is 'unwelcome to York',"" he said. Ms Reeves, who runs the Candle Shop on Stonegate, added: ""It's bad enough in a recession, but it would be even worse. ""Monks Cross is thriving at a weekend, but the tourists who come in are not buying in the town centre either."" Other traders have welcomed the plans as an opportunity for the city centre to evolve. Andrew Nixon, manager of Banks' music shop, said the city centre could become a ""Mecca"" for specialist retailers. George Myerscough of Robson and Coopers, which supplies bags and luggage on Lendal, said the business was so well established the new development would not impact on their custom.",Plans for a major shopping and sports stadium on the outskirts of York have gone on public display amid fears by some city centre traders that the development will cost them business.

"Rachael Maskell told the BBC the abuse came via social media and in some ""very nasty emails"". The Labour MP for York Central said more needed to be done to tackle online abuse and protect young people. She added that she was determined not to let the threats prevent her serving her constituents. 'Freedom of speech' Jo Cox was shot and stabbed to death in Birstall, West Yorkshire on 16 June, 2016. The 41-year-old's killer, Thomas Mair, 53, was jailed for life in November after being found guilty. Ms Maskell said despite being concerned for her safety and that of her staff, the death of Ms Cox was ""so heavy"" on her mind it ""overrode everything else"". ""I was just really raw after Jo's murder, and really concerned about her family,"" she said. Ms Maskell said she had now chosen to talk about the threats she received in a bid to highlight the issue of online abuse and, particularly, how it affects young people. She said: ""Freedom of speech is so important - it is what we value across our country - but the abuse I received online went way beyond that. ""We need to make sure we have a zero tolerance to abusive behaviour online."" The MP is calling for social media firms to remove abusive posts and do more to trace those responsible. It comes after shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said women may be deterred from entering politics because of abuse suffered by female MPs. In February, John Nimmo, from South Shields, was jailed after he made anti-Semitic death threats to another female Labour MP and threatened to blow up a mosque.",An MP has revealed she received death threats and was sent an image of a severed head around the time her colleague Jo Cox was murdered.
"The 17-year-old has been very open about his drug use in his music and on social media. But in a post on New Year's Day, he wrote: ""2018 we going even more crazy...(btw I don't take xanz no more)"". His decision comes not long after the death of rapper Lil Peep from a suspected drug overdose in November. Even if you haven't heard the name Lil Pump, you've almost definitely heard his song Gucci Gang. His 2017 breakthrough single has more than 300m views on YouTube and includes lyrics like ""They kicked me out the plane off a Percocet"" - a reference to a painkiller. And in September, he posed with a Xanax cake after hitting one million followers on Instagram. But in 2018 he says his relationship with Xanax - which is used to treat anxiety - is over and he's not alone. His friend and fellow rapper Smokepurpp has made the same vow on Twitter. The two have collaborated on music for Lil Pump's debut mix tape - including a track called Smoke my Dope. Rapper Travis Scott tweeted in support of Smokepurpp's decision to stop taking Xanax in 2017. Lil Peep's death prompted many conversations about the glamourisation of prescription drugs used to treat pain or anxiety among a new generation of rappers.

"It said it exposed the organisation to a significant risk of fraud. The report also criticised the Department for Social Development, which oversees the executive, for not being aware of issues within the organisation. It follows a number of critical reports about the Housing Executive. Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee Michaela Boyle said the report exposed a ""catalogue of failures"". ""We know that most Housing Executive staff, overseeing those businesses contracted to respond to maintenance needs, are diligent and hard working,"" she said. ""However, we found that the management and oversight of this service has been abjectly poor - so poor that it calls into question the capability and competence of management within the Housing Executive over many years, particularly at a senior level. ""We would even go so far as to say that it would appear that some members of senior management actively undermined the systems of control that had been put in place."" 'Whistle-blower' The report highlighted the fact that the committee had raised concerns about the performance of the Housing Executive's management after issues were raised by a whistle-blower and that these reviews had been on-going since 2008. It found that there was a culture within the Housing Executive that discouraged staff from raising concerns, including the use of IT to attempt to identify an anonymous whistle-blower. Ms Boyle said: ""The practices we found give the impression that staff who raise concerns in the course of their work or in a whistle-blowing capacity will not be supported or protected. ""I want to put this on the record - discouraging whistle-blowing or creating the perception that whistle-blowers are not welcome is simply unacceptable."" Last year's audit came after the Housing Executive's contract with the Red Sky maintenance company was terminated in 2011. This followed claims of substandard work and financial irregularities. Social development minister, Nelson McCausland, said he will carefully consider the committee's recommendations. He said his department has monthly accountability meetings with the senior team in NIHE to be assured that the necessary measures are being taken. Mr McCausland said he is ""determined to work through the issues raised.""","The Public Accounts Committee has accused the Housing Executive of being ""out of control"" in the way it managed maintenance contracts."
"The 60-year-old died suddenly on 17 April, collapsing while walking his dog on the Isle of Man. Mr Lambden represented the island at the 1982 Commonwealth Games and had a personal best at the London Marathon of two hours 43 minutes. He has been descried as a ""true ambassador for Manx athletics"". A spokesman for the Manx Harriers Athletics Club said he was ""not only a fabulous athlete but... a giant of Manx athletics"". His sister Margaid Gosschalk is planning to stand with a Manx flag at the five-mile point, where he would have been standing to cheer his fellow athletes on. She said: ""As he won't be there, we have ordered a Manx flag and I will be there. It's the least we can do in Murray's memory. ""He was proud to represent both the Isle of Man and GB and the incredible tributes I have been reading on so many sites from athletes and friends shows just how much people appreciated all he did to support and encourage others."" The married father of two's achievements included winning the 85-mile Parish Walk. In recent years he was an ever-present at sporting events with his camera and administered the Parish Walk website.","More than 100 Manx runners will wear a red bow while competing in the London Marathon, in memory of Murray Lambden who died last week."
"Large groups of the fish gather in the Irish Sea and Scotland's Sea of the Hebrides from May to October to breed and feed on plankton. Research led by the University of Aberdeen used genetic profiles of individual animals. The scientists said it was possible the fish ""hang out"" with relatives. Genetic profiles were created from DNA extracted from swabs of skin mucus taken from basking sharks swimming close to the surface as they fed. The sampled sharks included fish found off Scotland and Ireland in summer months. Regular shark swabbing built up a register of more than 400 DNA profiles. Dr Catherine Jones, who helped to lead the study, said: ""Perhaps relatives hang out together, which could facilitate learning migration routes and encourage other cooperative behaviours. ""This means there's more going on in basking shark aggregations than first appears in that they don't fit the shark stereotype of a lonesome independent predator."" Basking sharks, an endangered species, are the world's second largest fish after whale sharks and can grow to more than 10m (33ft) long. Scientists in Norway and Ireland were also involved in the study, which has been published in the journal Scientific Reports. Dr Lilian Lieber, of Queen´s University Belfast and another of the lead researchers on the project, said collecting DNA samples had posed a major challenge. ""A breakthrough came when we discovered our techniques worked on skin mucus,"" she said. ""We routinely swabbed aggregations of sharks quickly and with minimal disturbance, to obtain genetic profiles of individuals travelling together.""","Basking sharks travel migratory routes in groups of extended family, a new study led by Scottish scientists has suggested."
"Councillors have asked for a inquiry over whether the council got a fair price for the sale or not. The former HM Coroner's office in Smethwick, West Midlands, was put up for sale in December 2012. It was bought in May 2013 by the son for £80,000. In December it appeared for auction for £120,000. It has now been sold subject to contract, although estate agents Bairstow Eves said it could not confirm the purchase price. The council's asset land and disposal committee, chaired by Labour Councillor Mahboob Hussain, approved officers' recommendation to sell the office. It was later bought by his son Azeem Hafeez, according to the Land Registry. Investigation call Although there is no suggestion Mr Hussain knew his son would bid for the property when the committee authorised the sale, or that either Mr Hussain or Mr Hafeez have behaved improperly with regard to the sale, the difference in value of the office building has led to calls for an investigation into whether the council obtained best value on the sale to Mr Hafeez. UKIP councillor Philip Garrett, former independent socialist councillor Mick Davies and former Conservative councillor Ray Nock have said the sale should be investigated. The council did not clarify if it took advice on the valuation before completing the sale for £80,000, despite being asked by the BBC. Sandwell Council has now said its own audit service will conduct an inquiry and former mayor Sadie Smith, a former Liberal Democrat councillor, said the council's procedures should be ""scrupulous"". On Thursday, Mr Hussain stood down as chair of the council's asset management and land disposal committee but will continue to serve as the council's deputy leader, a cabinet member and Oldbury ward councillor. The council said his resignation was a neutral act which did not imply any wrongdoing. Mr Hafeez could not be reached for comment. Sandwell Council's chief executive Jan Britton said: ""Councillor Hussain has stood down as chair of the asset management and land disposal committee while certain allegations that have been made are investigated by the council's audit service."" In a personal statement, Mr Hussain said he had stood down from chairing the committee to protect himself and his family from repeated, unwarranted attacks on social media. He said: ""I fully expect the audit service's investigation to clearly show I have followed all the proper rules and procedures."" The council first agreed to sell the site after a kitchen fire in October 2012 that made it unusable and the Coroner's Service moved to alternative accommodation.",A councillor has stood down from a committee following criticism that Sandwell Council sold an office cheaply to his son.
"By Annabel RackhamNewsbeat reporter For DJ Sam Divine, 2020 was set to be her busiest one yet - she was fully booked until November. ""Last year I missed a lot of friend's birthdays and weddings because we get booked up so far in advance so this has definitely taught me to get a work/life balance for sure,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I did 10 or 12 shows in Ibiza last year so that's two a month. ""I was getting the first flight out on a Saturday morning, playing the closing set until 7am and then getting a flight."" Sam is one of Defected Records most recognisable faces - she hosts their radio show, releases music under the label and DJs around the world. Her schedule's been cleared for the time being, but she says it's been a good chance to chill at home and work on some new music. ""I've started four or five collabs while I've been locked down and I would never have the time to do that if I was on the road because I'm either in a hotel, flying or in a club,"" she says. Another big project she's been a part of during lockdown has been Defected's virtual festivals. The independent music label and events company were one of the first to take up virtual performances and DJ sets - putting on their first ten-hour festival on the 20th March, just before lockdown was announced. A hugely recognisable presence in house music and disco alongside their sister label Glitterbox, they've been responsible for some of the biggest dance music releases in recent years, such as Pump It Up by Endor, Joys by Roberto Surace and CamelPhat's breakout track Cola. They were looking forward to the summer ahead with their own festivals in London and Croatia, a residency in Ibiza and hosting stages at Creamfields, We Are Festival and Tomorrowland. All of which are now cancelled. Exclusive acts The nine virtual festivals they've put on during lockdown have been seen by over 14 million people globally, a much bigger audience compared to what they'd get at real life shows. Like a real festival, they had a number of sets across the day from various DJs, with many of them using green screens to create backdrops and graphics you'd normally see on stage at Defected events. They've also been able to get huge artists like Calvin Harris, Carl Cox and A-Trak to perform. ""We would have never booked those kinds of artists normally because line-ups get done months and months in advance,"" Sam Divine says. ""Those artists would have been busy doing their own thing so the fact everyone is grounded means they can do it."" Simon Dunmore, who founded Defected Records in 1999, says he wanted to bring what made their real-life events so successful to the virtual world. ""When we initially went into the virtual festival scene, we provided a very broad offering so that everybody felt welcome,"" Simon says. ""In our house, we're all equal and we welcome everybody, but we also want people to feel that it's special to them and personal as well."" By incorporating their drag performers in their virtual shows, it matched some of what people might have experienced in real life. ""Great clubs are about the people on the dance floor, the people that understand music,"" Simon says. ""With the extravagant flamboyance and charisma - people feed off of that. ""So if you see someone that's on a podium that's engaged with the DJ and is loving the record it brings a vibe to the whole occasion."" Livestream fatigue? But while some big names have benefitted from the chance to take their performances online, it hasn't been as helpful for less-established artists. Simon says smaller acts trying to make a name for themselves with new music have ""suffered"" trying to make their work visible or find audiences to promote it. ""People have had to find new ways of engaging with their fans and communities, hence why everyone's clamoured to get online at the same time,"" he says. ""It's been really overcrowded with live streams and Instagram Lives so it's been a challenging period for the music industry."" Defected have made sure to give smaller artists a platform as part of their virtual festival line-ups, with people like TQ Grant and Catz n Dogz both performing after releasing new music on the label. Defected has now scaled back what it's been doing online and is putting on more bespoke events for the people who'd booked to go to their live summer events. Last week they put on their first exclusive Zoom party for the 5,000 people who had tickets for their now-cancelled Croatia festival - it was invite only and had DJs performing to a select group of people who could all see each other partying. ""It keeps the community happy, which is really important and they then tell their friends and that's more powerful - people talking about our music rather than us saying 'here's a great record you need to hear about',"" says Simon. Virtual festivals and Zoom parties online have ben well received by fans, but even the organisers admit it's not quite the same as the real thing. ""I don't think there's going to be a replacement for actually experiencing a DJ live and being in the crowd and there in the moment to connect to other people enjoying the same thing and coming together,"" says Simon. He doesn't think there will be any live Defected events this year, but says as soon as it feels safe promises things will ""go back to the way they used to be"".

"South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Warwick Hospital, has announced a partnership with Serco. BBC Midlands Today health correspondent Michele Paduano said the trust and Serco were considering putting in a bid together to run George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton. The George Eliot Trust said it would look at a bid if one was made by the South Warwickshire trust and the firm. The South Warwickshire trust said one possible example of its partnership with Serco was allowing people with diabetes to better manage their condition at home, reducing time at hospital, as the firm could provide access to technology for the patients. 'Shared vision' It added the trust and the company would look over the coming months at how the partnership could work. The trust said initial talks with Serco began following ""a shared vision and interest in working with George Eliot NHS Hospital Trust"". The South Warwickshire trust has said it wants to have a single foundation trust across the county. It currently runs hospitals in south Warwickshire and community services, such as district nurses and health visitors, across the entire county. Responding to the partnership announcement, George Eliot trust chief executive Kevin McGee said: ""I am sure it's a great announcement for the people of South Warwick. ""If South Warwick and Serco come forward with a bid to work with us we will look at that as we need to look at all bids that come forward.""",A Warwickshire health trust has agreed a partnership with a private company.
"By Georgina RannardBBC News It comes as people across the UK have told BBC News they are finding it impossible to stay safe outside because our cities were not built for social distancing. How we will travel while maintaining social distancing is one of the biggest challenges the government faces as it seeks to start to lift the lockdown. It has led communities, UK transport groups and public health experts to call for radical changes - some already happening globally - such as wider pavements, traffic restrictions and cycle networks. Such changes would prevent further waves of infections, improve air quality and public health, and help countries achieve their climate goals, they say. The decline in road use during the lockdown has seen dramatic falls in air pollution - an unforeseen benefit of the pandemic - as well as quieter roads for cycling. But social distancing has highlighted the close proximity in which we all live, particularly in urban areas. In Manchester, Deborah Todd has given up on pavements and now walks in the roads with her children; Carrie-Ann Lightley had an accident because pedestrians did not make space for her wheelchair on the pavement in Cumbria; Julie Taylor has to queue to walk through the narrow alleyway outside her home in Wiltshire. And in London, Anne Bookless has stopped going outside altogether because there is no room for her wheelchair. Cycling has increased by 22% in places such as Greater Manchester, including those key workers commuting by bike where public transport is closed. When public transport does reopen, capacity will be severely restricted. In London, the Tube will be able to handle less than 15% of its pre-pandemic rush hour peak: 50,000 passengers every 15 minutes, compared with 325,000 before, according to leaked documents seen by the BBC. And if more people travel by car, instead of public transport, road space - already at a premium - will be under even greater pressure. ""The crisis has exposed how little space is allocated to people - it's exposed that everyone wants safe streets,"" Chris Boardman, Cycling Commissioner for Manchester and former Olympic cyclist, says. The UK is being urged to follow the lead of cities like Paris, Berlin and New York City and install temporary measures to create space for social distancing. Using temporary traffic orders, councils can widen pavements, install networks of temporary cycle lanes, and close residential streets to through-traffic. ""If we enable people to travel differently, we will protect them now during the crisis, and afterwards, when the public health benefits of more people exercising and breathing in cleaner air kick in. That's how you protect the NHS,"" says Mr Boardman. But banning cars ignores the needs of many road users, says Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA): ""Selective bans will have detrimental impacts on all other roads, add to congestion and journey times as well as increase pollution and CO2 emissions,"" he argues. Scientists warn we will need to practise social distancing for at least the next 12-18 months. Public transport will be severely reduced, meaning commuters will need to find other ways to travel. There are signs people will turn to their cars in greater numbers than pre-lockdown: 56% of drivers currently without a car plan to buy one post-lockdown, according to car sales company AutoTrader. In Wuhan, China, private car usage nearly doubled when lockdown ended, rising from 34% before the outbreak to 66% after lockdown. ""There is an avalanche of private car usage coming if we don't do something about it,"" says Leo Murray from climate action charity Possible, which campaigns for green transport. In the UK's most polluted urban areas, where two studies suggest the air quality is putting people at higher risk of dying from Covid-19, there is a heightened sense of urgency. People in cities such as London, Birmingham, and Glasgow are already struggling with respiratory disease and heart attacks linked to air pollution. If car use soars, it will be catastrophic for public health and well-being, Mr Murray suggests, as well as for the climate change goals that require a 50% decline in private car use in the UK. ""There is a real incentive to keep our respiratory health as good as possible. Walking and cycling is the way to keep London moving in a safe and socially distanced way,"" says Caroline Russell, London Assembly and Islington councillor for the Green Party. Just 9% of people want a total return to pre-lockdown life, according to a YouGov survey. Most journeys in the UK are short - 68% are under five miles - meaning that most people could complete them easily by bike if they felt confident and safe. Habit change is notoriously difficult, according to psychologists, but the crisis has transformed behaviours overnight. ""We've got this really precious moment to change how we live and we can't let it slip between our fingers. Let this tragedy re-define, in a positive way, what living in cities is about,"" says Will Butler-Adams, the CEO of UK bike manufacturer Brompton. A global trend British cities are lagging behind their global counterparts in making effective changes. So far, the government has made it easier for councils to close streets to cars, and London has announced its Streetspace Plan to encourage millions more to cycle and walk. But councillors and planners say more is needed. ""Local councils are overwhelmed with emergency work and lack funding - the government itself needs to lead,"" says Adam Tranter, Cycling Mayor for the city of Coventry. In London, a group of women calling themselves the Tactical Urbanistas took matters into their own hands. Last week they widened the pavement outside a busy high street supermarket, using painted circles on the road surface and makeshift barriers of tyres filled with soil and flowers. Residents in Tower Hamlets welcomed the change and the barriers were applauded on social media, the group say. However, the local council objected and removed the tyres, citing safety reasons. ""London's streets are not safe for social distancing and a disproportionate amount of space is given to cars at the expense of other road users. This is a public health risk and needs to be treated urgently,"" Tactical Urbanistas told BBC News. 'Quick and cheap' Plans for building cycle networks already exist - government and local authorities just need to enact them, say numerous experts including Brian Deegan, a street engineer who helped design the London and Manchester cycle networks. Light segregation of roads for cycle paths and widening pavements would be cheap and quick, he adds. ""It demands an emergency response. If residents don't like the temporary measures, councils can reverse them when the crisis is over. But history shows people prefer the quieter and cleaner streets,"" he suggests. Community groups that have long called for greener, sustainable cities hope the pandemic could bring that change. In Germany, officials concluded that temporary cycle lanes installed in Berlin helped residents observe social distancing measures and had no negative impact on traffic flows. ""So much has been taken away from us, and now people are focussing on the smaller things,"" says Paul Riley, from Transition Liverpool. ""We've learnt that it is possible to implement change, if we want it.""",The UK government is urging the public to walk and cycle to work instead of using public transport or driving.
"The Welsh Language Society has asked people to stop paying for the licence until the UK government guarantees what they say is sufficient funding for S4C. Singer and Plaid Cymru politician Dafydd Iwan is among those refusing to pay. TV Licensing warned not having a valid TV licence is a criminal offence. The Welsh language broadcaster is currently directly funded by the UK Government. But in future it will be funded almost entirely through the BBC and with a reduced budget, a move supporters see as a blow to its independence and its future. The Welsh Language Society, Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, said they collected more than 100 names in support within four days of launching their campaign early last month. Chair Bethan Williams said:""The future of our only Welsh language TV channel hangs in the balance. ""It faces cuts of over 40% in real terms, a takeover by the BBC, and powers in the hands of Westminster Ministers to get rid of S4C completely. ""It's a critical situation, that's why we are pleased that so many people have started to stop paying the TV licence. ""This is a campaign we can win and we're confident because of the rising public support for the need for a strong future for the world's only Welsh language TV channel."" Ms Williams said their supporters were following in the ""same tradition of peaceful direct action campaigning"" as Gwynfor Evans, the former Plaid Cymru MP for Carmarthen who threatened to fast to death if the government did not provide a Welsh-language channel. The threat was a key factor in the decision to set up S4C, according to cabinet papers from 1980 released last month under the 30-year rule. The group is holding hold public meetings across Wales from January until March to raise awareness of what it calls the threats to S4C and to discuss the way forward. A TV Licensing spokesperson said: ""Regardless of personal opinion, if you don't have a valid TV Licence when you need one, it's against the law and you risk a prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000.""","More than 100 people have said they will not pay their TV licence in protest at changes at S4C, say Welsh language campaigners."

"James LandaleDeputy political editor@BBCJLandaleon Twitter Len McCluskey told reporters he could see the union voting to disaffiliate from a defeated Labour if it ceased to be the voice of working people. He said he feared for the future of the Labour Party and said he agreed with those who said the party had no ""God given"" right to exist. The party was at a crossroads, he said. He told a press gallery lunch at Westminster that Labour leader Ed Miliband had not yet presented a ""coherent vision"" to the electorate and if it were ""a pale shadow of austerity"", then he believed Labour would be defeated in 2015. Mr McCluskey also confirmed that there was a debate taking place within Labour over its strategy, between those favouring a ""transformative programme"" and those wanting to ""shrink the offer"" the party puts forward. It was, he said, ""grumble time"" within the Labour Party and MPs were getting ""uneasy"". He also said there was a danger of Labour taking UKIP for granted. 'Watershed' Asked if Unite could give money to other parties, Mr McCluskey replied: ""We are affiliated to the Labour Party. We cannot give any financial support to any other political party. So the rules within Unite would need to be changed."" But he added: ""Can I ever envisage a rules conference voting to disaffiliate from Labour? I can, I can, and that's a challenge to Ed Miliband because I believe the Labour Party is at a crossroads, this is a watershed. ""Labour consistently has to demonstrate that it is our voice, we created it. At the beginning of the last century, ordinary working people sat down… to create a party of labour so that we had a voice in the political arena. ""Is Labour still that voice? I'm hoping the answer to that is yes, but we are at a stage in politics at the moment where just bumbling along in the old ways is not going to happen any more. ""People will put those questions under deeper scrutiny. And unless Ed and the Labour leadership demonstrate that they are on our side... then I can envisage a debate taking place if Labour lost the election next May. 'Lack of vision' ""I fear for the future of the Labour Party and so these are serious debates at this point in time in our history. ""We have to kind of consider all of those issues, at the moment, though that's not on our agenda. ""It is grumble time at the moment in the parliamentary Labour Party. People are getting uneasy. There isn't a coherent vision emerging. I am confident that what will emerge is a platform to take to the British electorate. I hope that it will be an alternative. ""If it is a pale shadow of austerity, then I believe Labour will be defeated at the next election. ""I believe that the British electorate are of a mind, unless there is a real alternative, to say 'We had better stick with the devil we know'."" ""Ed's challenge is to simply demonstrate that he is on the side of ordinary people. He has to give hope to people, that we are going to do something different with power. ""If he does that with passion, with some conviction, then the polls will begin to alter and he will begin to be considered a genuine alternative. There is an argument between those who want a transformative programme and those who want to shrink the offer and play around with the 35% strategy. If we do do that, we will lose. If we put forward hope, then Labour will win. ""There is a danger that Labour take UKIP for granted. What Labour has to do is fill the vacuum. The reason UKIP is gaining is because people are thinking all political parties are the same, not dealing with their concerns over immigration or Europe.""

"By Stephen McDonellBBC News, Anhui Province Imagine limitless energy with virtually no waste at all: this is the lofty promise of nuclear fusion. On Science Island in Eastern China's Anhui Province, there is a large gleaming metal doughnut encased in an enormous shiny, round box about as big as a two-storey apartment. This is the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (or EAST). Inside, hydrogen atoms fuse and become helium which can generate heat at several times the temperature of the sun's core. Powerful magnets then control the reaction, which could one day produce vast amounts of electricity if maintained. Around the globe, they are trying to master nuclear fusion - in the United States, Japan, Korea, Brazil and European Union - but none can hold it steady for as long as the team in Anhui. Right now that's 100 seconds and it gets longer every year. Here they're already talking about goals which are 10 times as long, at temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius. But there's a reason why fusion has eluded scientists and engineers since the early advances in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. It is really difficult. Safe nuclear energy Maintaining a limited fusion reaction in a controlled environment has been possible for more than 50 years and yet the duration is still a long way short of what would be needed to capture this vast heat and convert it to electricity. The EAST system is a souped-up version of the original Russian design. On the day we visit we watch a lively debate unfold in the control room. There are leakage problems - not material getting out but air being sucked into the vacuum within - and they need to find a solution. A separate group is in walkie-talkie contact with the control room. They move around the configuration of pipes, electricity housing and stepladders surrounding the Tokamak, looking to patch the leak. When Xi Jinping visited here he wanted to know about the dangers of this technology, so we asked what they told China's president. ""A fusion reactor is quite safe compared with fission reactor,"" says Song Yuntao, deputy director at EAST. ""Magnetic confinement is controllable fusion. I can shut down the power supply and it's perfectly safe. There won't be any nuclear disaster."" Current nuclear reactors rely on fission and the splitting of an atom which leaves toxic waste that must be safely stored for potentially tens of thousands of years. A nuclear fusion power plant would instead stem from the joining of two nuclei to make a single nucleus and then magnets inside the internal wall of the doughnut contain the reaction (called the plasma) inside the huge tube. Crucially, we're told, this leaves almost no waste. A hefty price tag However the technology is not cheap. It costs $15,000 a day just to turn on the machine and that's without the wages of hundreds of specialists, the construction of buildings and the like. And yet the Chinese government is digging into its deep pockets to fund the project in the full knowledge that it could be decades before fusion is lighting up major cities. ""Fusion is going to require huge breakthroughs from scientists and engineers as well as a lot of financial backing from the government,"" Mr Song says. ""It's a project which costs so much but personally I think it's going to be great for the sustainable development of mankind."" Because it carries such a hefty price tag and because it is so hard, the pursuit of fusion is seeing a fair amount of international collaboration. For example, China is one of the countries contributing to the ambitious International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in southern France which - apart from European nations - draws in India, Japan, Russia, South Korean and the United States. It is expected to start testing in 2025. In the meantime China is also making leaps and bounds on its own. The proposed next step for this team is to design a fully-fledged nuclear fusion test reactor capable of generating electricity. To eventually work properly it would have to be much bigger than what we've seen and able to contain a plasma reaction indefinitely rather than for a minute-and-a-half. ""The demand for energy is huge in every country and China has a roadmap for fusion-generated power,"" says Mr Song. ""We want to complete the design for a test fusion reactor within five years. If we succeed it will be the world's first fusion reactor."" The eventual hope is that fusion might produce electricity in volumes beyond mankind's wildest dreams. It may be some way off but Beijing is taking the challenge very seriously meaning that, if it can get it to work, China could end up having the edge over all others when it comes to the power generation of the future.","In a world with an ever-increasing demand for electricity and a deteriorating environment, Chinese scientists are leading the charge to develop what some see as the holy grail of energy. The BBC's Stephen McDonell was given rare access to their facility in Anhui province."
"Nicholas WattNewsnight political editor@nicholaswatton Twitter Is it possible in Britain's parliamentary democracy, the conversations go, to imagine a version of the 2017 French presidential election? Emmanuel Macron, a semi-outsider, vanquished France's two largest parties. And he also defeated Marine Le Pen, who had put in the far-right Front National's strongest ever performance in a presidential election. Yet until now the thinking has always been that it would be impossible to enter Downing Street directly via this route. Unlike in France, where the president is directly elected by the people, the British prime minister (a humble head of government) has to command the confidence of parliament. British prime ministers have to earn their spurs on the backbenches and on opposition or government frontbenches before they are seen as a serious contender for high office. Jeremy Corbyn, a backbencher for 32 years, started to rewrite these rules in 2015 when he managed to appeal - over the heads of the parliamentary Labour party - to grassroots members thirsting for change. If he makes it to No 10, it would qualify as a mini-Macron moment, although he would by then have been auditioning for the part as opposition leader for around half a decade. In the Conservative party the younger generation of MPs are wondering whether they may be able to provide a truer Macron moment - finding a candidate to leap frog over the older generation and straight into No 10. I understand that conversations are being held among the younger generation of Tory MPs, elected in 2015 and 2017, to find an agreed candidate to support once Theresa May stands down. I am told that if the prime minister were to be forced out in the near future they would hold back and wait for the following leadership contest. But if she were to go at a time of her own choosing in the next few years then they would field a candidate. There are some bright and impressive Conservative MPs elected in the last two elections. Many of them are, to put it mildly, fed up with the current contenders who command the headlines. They believe that Boris Johnson and Michael Gove should be disqualified because they both failed in spectacular fashion during the 2016 leadership contest. Many believe that Jacob Rees-Mogg would be divisive because he is so closely associated with one side on Brexit. No telephone lines are being installed and no campaigns are being organised. But these are the five candidates who are, whether they like it or not, being tipped to create a Tory Macron moment. Listed in alphabetical order of their constituencies they are: Some of the five voted Remain, others voted Leave, some hold junior positions, others hold none in government. Some will be horrified by the thought they are being mentioned as candidates for the top, others will be chuffed. But the five all have one thing in common. They are seen either as potential unity candidates should the Conservative party wish to end its Brexit civil war or they simply stand out as candidates it would be impossible to ignore. If one were to emerge it would not be an exact Macron parallel because they are, unlike the French president in 2017, parliamentarians. But unlike Macron, none of the possible contenders has served in cabinet. A rule of thumb in politics at the moment is to be wary of making predictions. But one thing is clear: the next generation of Tories is growing mightily impatient with their seniors. You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on Iplayer.

"Anthony Levandowski was charged with 33 counts of trade theft involving Alphabet's self-driving car technology. He had left Alphabet's Waymo unit in 2016 and eventually ran Uber's self-driving car project, only to be fired. The 39-year-old, who now runs his own firm, denies the charges. ""Not a single one of these supposedly secret files ever went to Uber or to any other company or person,"" said Miles Ehrlich, a lawyer for Mr Levandowski. Waymo and Uber were involved in a protracted lawsuit, which the taxi company eventually settled in 2018. Mr Levandowski was not party to that case, and did not publicly comment on the allegations. The claim is that before leaving Waymo, Mr Levandowski downloaded thousands of files in 2015 related to Alphabet's self-driving car technology, including details related to Lidar, a crucial sensor technology for self-driving cars. ""All of us have the right to change jobs, none of us has the right to fill our pockets on the way out the door,"" Californian federal prosecutor David Anderson said. ""Theft is not innovation."" In the 2018 settlement, which underlined technology companies' race to lead the market in autonomous technology, Uber promised not to use Alphabet's technology and to give Waymo a 0.34% stake in Uber. Mr Levandowski faces up to 10 years in jail and could be fined $250,000 per count, $8.25m in total. He was a founding member of the group that started Google's self-driving car project. Mr Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to launch his own self-driving software start-up called Otto, which was later acquired by Uber. Uber said it had ""co-operated with the government throughout their [DoJ] investigation and will continue to do so"".",The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has filed criminal charges against a former senior engineer at Google's owner Alphabet alleging he stole car technology secrets.
"Jingye Group said that the move would save more than 3,000 jobs in Scunthorpe and Teesside and it would modernise the towns' steelworks. The firm reportedly offered £50m to buy the company after it collapsed and was placed under the control of the UK Insolvency Service last year. Unions have said that although the deal ""must be celebrated"", about 450 workers still face losing their jobs. British Steel employed about 5,000 people at the time of its collapse, and is the second-largest steelmaker in the country. The sale includes the steelworks at Scunthorpe, mills in Teesside and Skinningrove, as well as the TSP Engineering business based in Cumbria. Jingye Group, which also makes steel, has promised to invest about £1.2bn over the next 10 years on upgrading its plants and machinery. 'A new chapter' for British steelmaking Jingye's chief executive, Li Hiuming, said: ""It has not been an easy journey since we first announced our intentions in November. ""But the longer I have spent in Scunthorpe, the more I have come to believe in the successful future of these steelworks and the employees that have made them famous throughout the world."" He added that the deal marks the ""beginning of a new illustrious chapter"" in the history of British steelmaking. Charlotte Childs, an organiser for the GMB union, described the deal as ""a big win for the industry"", but expressed disappointment at job cuts. She said: ""It is heartbreaking that long-serving members of high-skilled staff, many of whom have given their entire career to British steel, are seen as surplus to requirements."" Tony Watson, a British Steel worker and GMB union convenor, is one of those who has been made redundant. Mr Watson, who worked for British Steel on and off since the age of 16, told the BBC he received an email from HR with the news. ""The way the process has been done has been a bit brutal,"" he said. But Mr Watson added that he was ""feeling optimistic"" about the prospect of hunting for a new job at age 59. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he wanted ""to reassure British Steel employees who may be facing redundancy that we are mobilising all available resources to give immediate on the ground support and advice to those affected"". Uncertainty for workers Confirmation of the takeover follows months of uncertainty for workers. The government has kept British Steel running since last May, as it looked for a buyer for the business.Jingye signed an agreement to purchase British Steel in November after talks between the Official Receiver, which handled the insolvency process, and a Turkish bidder fell apart. The Official Receiver said that it was ""grateful"" to British Steel employees for their professionalism during a difficult time. In January, the French government said it might veto the deal because it considered British Steel's plant in Hayange a strategic national asset. Located in north-east France, the plant is seen as important because it supplies track for the country's railways. Jingye's boss said earlier this year that he remained ""interested"" in purchasing the plant, but has pressed on with purchasing assets in the UK and the Netherlands. British Steel was formed in 2016 after being sold by India's Tata for £1 to the private equity firm Greybull Capital. It entered insolvency less than three years later. It had sought financial support from the government before it was placed in liquidation. Analysis: Sarah Corker, BBC business correspondent They've been making iron and steel in Scunthorpe for more than 150 years. This is very much a one-industry town and when the steelworks struggles the whole community feels it. The plant directly employs almost 3,000 people but supports another 20,000 jobs in the wider supply chain. From hairdressers to market traders, businesses say they've noticed people reining in their spending amid the ongoing uncertainty. The loss-making steel plant has had a string of owners over the decades from Corus to Tata Steel to Greybull Capital - all tried and failed to turn the business around. A fourth-generation steelworker told me back in May that it felt as though they were ""staring over the edge of the abyss"" as the plant was on the brink of closure with mass redundancies ahead. But - again - Scunthorpe steelworks has been rescued by a new owner at the eleventh hour promising huge investment. There is some scepticism about how much influence China will soon have in the UK steel industry. While steelworkers are deeply relieved that the takeover is going ahead, they are asking what Jingye can and will do differently amid tough global trading conditions where many before have struggled.",A Chinese firm completed its takeover of British Steel on Monday.
"The spoof page references a Bitcoin-themed documentary broadcast by Panorama last year, but links on the page direct visitors to a site promising to make them a millionaire. Reports indicate that the fake page is being spread via emails sent from hacked accounts. A spokesman for the BBC said it is looking into how best to respond. The Financial Conduct Authority has previously issued a warning about an earlier scheme run under the same Bitcoin Trader branding that features in the latest effort. This is not the first time an attempt has been made to link the brand to the BBC. Last year, adverts appeared on social media and elsewhere falsely claiming that a trading platform operating under the same name had been backed by several of Dragons' Den's stars. Two of the show's entrepreneurs - Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones - subsequently issued denials. Ads also claimed that Lord Alan Sugar had quit The Apprentice to help promote its software, leading the businessman to tweet that he had contacted the police. In addition, the former BBC journalist Martin Lewis - who now runs the MoneySavingExpert site - launched legal action against Facebook after it failed to remove fake ads suggesting he was also involved. And Sir Richard Branson has also warned that fake CNN news pages had been created to make it seem that he had endorsed a Bitcoin Trader-branded scheme. It is not, however, clear whether the people behind the effort are the same as before. Countdown timer The fake BBC News page contains a lengthy article describing an ""underground banking system"" that allows investors to turn small deposits into ""a fortune"". It presents a case study of one individual who supposedly saw an investment of less than £300 grow into nearly £900,000.

"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter What has now ended is the UK's economic membership of the bloc. Forty-eight years in the European customs union, basically the Common Market, and 28 years in the single market. The Single Market was a creation for which the UK has paternity rights. It was Margaret Thatcher's rallying call for European reform, her calling card to unleash a wave of Japanese investment in post-industrial Britain and shepherded into existence by her appointee as commissioner Arthur Cockfield. 'Tortuous negotiations' Its creation served the UK's economic interests, as it grew the home domestic market available for British exporters without tariff or non-tariff barriers, eventually to nearly half a billion Europeans. It was not without irony that the tortuous negotiations of the past four years were made tougher by the EU's insistence on defending what it calls the ""internal market"", itself created by the British. Indeed the institutional underpinning of this huge marketplace became too much for Mrs Thatcher. Famously she became suspicious of Commission President Delors turning up to tell the TUC that through the European Union workers could reassert rights rolled back by the Conservative Government. At her 1988 Bruges speech PM Thatcher replied: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" Perhaps this was the beginning of the path to Brexit, carried along by the push to monetary union and resentment at the overreach of the European Court of Justice and the considerable impact of the ""direct effect"" of community and then union law. The car industry was the prototype for the single market. Mrs Thatcher's campaigning for EEC membership was quickly followed by a charm offensive that began as opposition leader to get Japanese investors to build high tech factories to sell cars tariff-free across Europe. For the UK it would provide employment, technology, capital and competition for the languishing nationalised UK-owned auto sector. Conformity Ongoing membership of the EEC, restrictions on union activity and investment tax breaks were part of the deal communicated in writing to the then chairman of Nissan. The Datsun Bluebird was being developed in Sunderland and around the same time the Italians and the French threatened to slap tariffs on what they saw as a Japanese ruse to avoid tariffs and undercut their industry. The UK government quickly communicated that it was willing to take this matter to the European Court of Justice. The attempt to kill the Nissan factory at birth was fended off. From this, the UK car industry and other advanced manufacturing prospered from being plugged into rapid continent-wide supply chains, delivering each part just in time and just in sequence. All of that was enabled by conformity of regulations, standards, zero tariffs and the eradication of non-tariff barriers, for sale, but also within the manufacturing process. Similar stories could be told about the pharmaceutical industry, chemicals, the food industry, aerospace, and financial services. Within the EU, the UK even became the financial centre for a new currency, the euro, which it did not participate in. The single market itself, with regulations set and enforced in Brussels, became a player on the world stage. And yet there was a balancing act. The UK could influence the direction of one of the biggest tankers in the sea but was restricted in acting more nimbly in new industries. In some sectors, the UK's trade dealings with the US or Asia were more important than with Europe. And so this tension led to breaking point. And for the Conservative Party in particular the single market's institutions it created and championed, became something akin to Frankenstein's monster. Some Brexiteers had hoped that the edifice would collapse once the UK left. But it has proven more robust than that. Indeed, Brexit has proven a catalyst of the EU to sign trade and investment deals far more quickly, including even with China. So now the UK finds itself outside of the machine it created as its strategic competitor. The trade negotiation wasn't primarily about trade. Great Britain has declared regulatory independence, or to be more specific, has declared as much regulatory independence as is compatible with a zero-tariff trade deal. The EU retains levers and switches to turn off some of these tariff advantages should the UK use the deal to turn into an offshore tariff free assembly hub for US and Asian manufacturing to be traded into the single market. Unlike with Nissan four decades ago, the European Court of Justice will no longer be there. The PM wants regulatory competition but his own deal contains disincentives, if not actual restrictions, on competing ""unfairly"" or too much. So the strategy matters. Britain is free, but to do what exactly? To level up? Well the regions that need levelling up are the ones that are actually most dependent on exports to Europe. Exports to Europe will be spared tariffs, thanks to the deal, but there will be literally millions of non-tariff barriers, that the economists calculate matter more, from health checks, customs formalities, origin paperwork, assessments of standards etc. Even to qualify for tariff-free treatment means, according to new government guidance on ""rules of origin"", analysis of how complicated is the process of grating cheese, of the shelling of nuts, and formalities on where the eyes of a doll come from. Most apply legally from tonight, having been absent for decades. The sweet spot for UK will now be to deploy regulatory freedom in sectors that are truly global, where we are not already overly dependent on EU markets. Certain sub-sectors within technology, finance and pharmaceuticals, for example. In each of these sectors the UK is likely to have to offer more friendly regulation to the multinational private sector, than the EU. It doesn't necessarily mean lower standards: It could be that UK medicines regulators, for example, build on the record of rapid approval for Covid vaccines in other medical areas. 'Picking winners' The deployment of massive scientific networks within the National Health service, used for rapid clinical testing, could become the envy of the world. Brexit Britain is likely to become a laboratory for the global economy. Car companies will need to be attracted with more permissive rules on data and, say autonomous driving testing. Some tech companies are already porting their UK customers to be served under US data privacy laws rather than more restrictive EU ones. But the government will also have to be very active and judicious. We are already ""picking winners"" again, at least in the satellite business. What about electric power, where the EU will fight aggressively, versus hydrogen power? There are a number of structural economic problems, from poor training, declining productivity and low investment that were not caused by EU membership which, in terms of non-tariff barriers, are made immediately worse by this type of Brexit, for which the UK has no option but to deal with. That process of looking outwards may not come quickly. Holyrood and Stormont rejected the Brexit trade deal. The UK has replaced a single market of 500 million Europeans free of non-tariff barriers with a single market smaller than the size of the UK. There is a trade border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland is mostly left in the EU single market. There are non-tariff barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of this deal. Unpredictable knock-on effects Lastly there are some big unknowns and unknowables. The inadvertent diplomatic consequences of changes in trade patterns can be profound. If, for example, the eminent historian RW Johnson is to be believed, the UK's accession to the EEC in the first place created the conditions for the fall of South Africa's apartheid regime which was ""hurt in several ways"". British trade was remodelled away from the Commonwealth to Europe, the EEC offered favourable trade with all of Africa except Pretoria. And then when Portugal followed its ally the UK into the EEC, its African colonies and white rule quickly lost to revolutions by black liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique. ""Thus the seeds of the 1976 Soweto uprising were sown"" in part by the UK joining the EEC. Which is obviously not to suggest the reverse would be true. It is merely to say that events such as these can have very unpredictable knock on effects. The Prime Minister has succeeded in taking the UK out of the Single Market created by his heroes. The UK now stands outside a system that it helped invent. For now its new single market is not the size of the country. The test of all of this, is to make the UK's new single market the size of the globe.",Nearly half a century of the UK's membership of the European Union and its predecessor organisations ended in January of course.

"Discounts are most common at retailers selling fashion and DIY goods, according to the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) Shop Price Index. Overall, it found prices of goods excluding food fell 3.7% in November. Market researchers Mintel and Springboard say they see similar trends and expect further falls in December. The BRC said the discounting reflected ""an extremely challenging year"" for retailers after trade was put on hold because of lockdowns. ""As we approach Christmas, consumers will be glad to see another month of falling prices,"" said boss Helen Dickinson. ""Where demand was weak for some products, discounting has followed, with many retailers trying to encourage more consumer spending, particularly those selling fashion and DIY goods."" The BRC's Shop Price Index tracked the price of 500 of the most commonly bought High Street products from 2 to 6 November - a period that crossed into the start of England's second national lockdown. 'Lumbered with stock' Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said pre-Christmas discounts were not new, but that there would be more deals than usual this year as non-essential shops tried to make up for lost sales. ""Many retailers will have committed to orders, not had enough time to cancel and then ended up lumbered with stock,"" she told the BBC. ""They won't be able to sell things like seasonal gift sets and certain fashion lines in the new year, so we expect lots of discounts on those."" Retailers are also trying to get people to do their Christmas shopping earlier, fearing a spike in online orders that will be hard to fulfil, said Nick Carroll, associate director of retail at Mintel. Online rush This partly explains why this year's Black Friday sale had lasted longer than usual, with deals available as early as 1 November, he said. ""We've seen huge pressure on logistics operations and people not able to get their goods on time, so the more demand is spread out out, the easier it will be."" The pandemic continues to batter retailers, putting thousands of jobs at risks. This week Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, while Debenhams announced it would shut its 124 UK stores after last-ditch rescue talks failed. The BRC's Ms Dickinson said businesses shuttered during lockdown had ""lost billions in sales and many are now in a precarious financial position"". She called for more government support saying that ""without such interventions, we will see countless more store closures and job losses"".","Shop prices are falling in the run-up to Christmas as retailers race to clear stock amid a ""deepening"" High Street crisis, a report has said."
"By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter The chances of a second poll To paraphrase the old joke, there are probably two chances of a second EU referendum right now - slim chance and fat chance. Ladbrokes is currently offering odds of 5/1 on it. At 11/8 the bookmakers think it is more likely that no deal will have been agreed before Britain officially leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have ruled out a second vote, both essentially arguing that it would be seen as a catastrophic breach of trust with a public already weary of broken promises. An establishment stitch-up? The idea that the political establishment will just keep holding referendums until they get the result they want - or simply ignore the result if they don't like it - was a constant refrain during the Brexit campaign. It has happened before, say Brexiteers. France and the Netherlands both rejected an EU constitution in 2005 referendums, which led to the document being repackaged and adopted by both countries as the Lisbon Treaty. Ireland then rejected the Lisbon Treaty in a 2008 referendum - it was the only EU country to hold such a vote - but then accepted it in a second referendum the following year, following pressure from the rest of the EU. But sometimes the establishment gets the result it wants and still has to face another vote. The term ""neverendum"" was coined in the French Canadian province of Quebec, which has twice voted against independence from Canada - the first time in 1980 by a majority of 59%. the second time, in 1995, by a shade over 50%. The prime ministers at the time of the two votes were pro-Canada. The independence campaign has never stopped pushing for a third vote. Farage has said it before The former UKIP leader has angrily denounced ""Remoaners"" like Tony Blair and Sir John Major for suggesting the public should be given another vote. ""I think there are 17.4m people out there who voted Brexit despite being told it was the wrong thing to do and I really think it would be a big mistake if these people get pushed too far,"" he said on his LBC radio show in November 2016. Yet before the referendum, he freely admitted he would have kept pushing for another vote if his side lost by a narrow margin. ""In a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way. If the remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it,"" he told the Daily Mirror. There is a kind of consistency here - the former UKIP chief will not be satisfied until Brexit has been resoundingly backed by the people, to ""finish the whole thing off"". ""It may well be that Nigel would get what he wants which is a completely hard Brexit,"" veteran Tory Eurosceptic Bill Cash told the BBC. But he added: ""I do find his position quite unconvincing and for him to be, as it were, bedfellows with the Liberal Democrats I think is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in British politics."" Perhaps Mr Farage - and one-time UKIP donor Arron Banks who also now backs a second referendum - are missing the spotlight and fancy getting the Brexit band back together for one more tour. He later clarified his remarks, saying a second referendum was the ""last thing"" he wanted to see but the Leave side had to be ready for one, as Remainers claimed support for another vote was growing. The opinion polls have not really shifted For all the sometimes wild claims from both sides, if a second referendum was held now there is no guarantee the outcome would be any different. Polling suggests Britons are becoming increasingly sceptical about the government's handling of Brexit talks ""but Leave voters for the most part have not changed their minds about their decision"", pollster Sir John Curtice said this week. The democracy argument But - say Remainers like Tony Blair - why should the 2016 referendum be the final word? That's not how democracy works, they argue. Mr Blair said in a BBC interview that people should be given a chance to ""think again"" once they have seen the final exit deal. He was a bit vague on how this might happen, suggesting it could be via another referendum or a general election, although this, he claimed, was a ""second order"" issue. Only the Liberal Democrats, with 12 MPs, are openly pushing for a second referendum. When would a second referendum have to be held? Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. The next scheduled general election is on 5 May 2022. It would take a change of Labour and/or Tory leadership, not to mention a major policy shift, and, in all likelihood, an early general election. So if there was to be another vote it would probably have to be held this year or, at the very latest, early next year. What would the question be? The June 2016 question was simple: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"" The next one, if it is ever posed, might be a bit more convoluted...",Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested earlier he was coming round to the idea of a second EU referendum - what is going on?

"Diana and Actaeon will hang at Norwich Castle Museum, the only regional venue to display the work in 2012. Titian, a Venetian artist, completed the piece in 1559 as a commission for Spain's King Philip II. County council spokesman James Carswell said: ""It is a privilege to bring this extraordinary painting to Norfolk."" Diana and Actaeon is part of a series of six large-scale mythology paintings that Titian painted in Venice during the 1550s. It is considered to be one of his finest works because of its ambitious scale, its unity of colour and subject matter and its historical importance. Heather Guthrie, exhibitions officer at the museum, said: ""It's a fabulous masterpiece. ""It has a wonderful mesmerising effect about it and I think that's one of the reasons it's been such an inspiration for so many artists throughout the course of history. We're jolly lucky to have it here."" Diana and Actaeon was put up for sale in 2008 and became the subject of ahigh profile campaignto save it for the nation. 'Sexy mythology' It was bought for £50m by the National Gallery and National Galleries of Scotland with contributions from the Scottish Government, National Heritage Memorial Fund, The Monument Trust, The Art Fund and the public. Vanessa Trevelyan, head of Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service, said: ""Titian was renowned as a painter of sexy mythology pictures during his lifetime. ""Ever since Diana and Actaeon came to Britain in 1798, it has been a powerful source of inspiration for artists. ""The painting was bought by the Duke of Bridgewater, whose descendants made it available to the public and sold it to the nation in 2008. ""It is a real privilege to be invited to show this important work, and we are enormously grateful to the National Gallery for offering us this unique opportunity."" Widely considered to be one of the most important paintings of the Italian Renaissance now in public ownership in this country,Diana and Actaeonis based on the poem Metamorphoses by the Roman poet Ovid. Exhibition officer Heather Guthrie said: ""In Victorian times, paintings were shown in public as a real spectacle and people would queue around the block to go and see a painting by a particularly well known artist as it was the best picture show in town. ""I don't know if we'll have the queues around the block, but it's a unique opportunity to see this painting by one of the world's great artists and to really try to come to an understanding as to what makes this such a fantastic painting."" On Friday, the sister painting to Diana and Actaeon -Diana and Callisto- was purchased for the nation after a £45m ($71.7m) deal was agreed with owner the Duke of Sutherland. The ""supremely important"" oil painting was bought with the help of £25m ($39.9m) from the National Gallery after a lengthy fundraising campaign. Titian's Diana and Actaeon can be seen at Norwich Castle Museum until 15 April.","A celebrated Titian masterpiece, saved for the nation after a £50m public fundraising appeal, is to go on show in Norfolk."
"Huw Lewis told AMs an ""enduring settlement"" was needed, above the ""sound and fury"" of election campaigns. Currently Welsh students pay about £3,500 tuition fees with the Welsh government paying the rest, wherever they choose to study in the UK. The cross-party review will look at the funding system and report back in 2016. The review has been ordered by Mr Lewis who said it was right to take stock at a time of ""rapid and unpredictable change"" facing universities. For each Welsh student that goes to university across the border it costs the Welsh government around £4,500. About £33m is estimated to be leaving Wales with this year's 7,370 first-year students. Welsh universities claim money is draining from the system, saying it could be used in the higher education sector within Wales instead. Mr Lewis has said the commission would examine many aspects of higher education in Wales, including the future of fee subsidies. Answering an urgent assembly question on Tuesday, Mr Lewis told AMs: ""I've made it clear (that) in 2015 we will see a general election and the debate that goes with that. ""(In) 2016 we will see a Welsh general election and the debate that goes with that. ""What we must have from this review is an enduring settlement which is above and beyond the sound and fury of any particular election campaign, and hence the timetable"". Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Wales, Mr Lewis denied he was delaying the issue so he did not have to tell the electorate what the policy would be at the 2016 assembly election. ""Reviews advise governments, they don't direct them,"" the minister said. ""The next assembly election is a little way off yet. ""Between now and then I'd like to see us have a sensible, all-party, all-opinion discussion here in Wales about how we can assist our young people and how we can make sure we have a good stable future for higher education."" 'Simply unsustainable' The three opposition parties have all questioned the timing of the review. The Lib Dem's education spokesman Aled Roberts said: ""We have all been waiting for the moment when the Welsh Labour government become up front with people about the faults of its higher education funding policy. Last night's announcement finally recognised that the current policy is simply unsustainable. ""The timeline for the review couldn't be more cynical. ""Having the review report back in autumn 2016 means that the people of Wales will have no idea of Welsh Labour's higher education policy prior to the assembly elections. ""It is incumbent on all parties to set out in detail their proposals for higher education funding before the assembly elections."" The Conservatives described the existing Welsh government policy as ""an uncosted election gimmick"" and welcomed the review ""wholeheartedly"". ""Further details on the cross-party commission are now urgently required and its bizarre timeline clarified. ""The report should be forthcoming before the 2016 assembly election."" 'Reluctance' Plaid Cymru education spokesman Simon Thomas also welcomed the commission, as ""an admission that the current policy is unsustainable"". ""However, the remit and timetable for the commission's reporting should be determined by its chair and panel,"" he said. ""A commission that does not report until after the next election will be seen as saying as much about the minister's reluctance to engage with his own party on reform as it does about anything else."" Welsh students pay about £3,500 in tuition fees with the Welsh government paying the rest through a grant, wherever they choose to study in the UK. On average, English universities charge around £8,000 a year in fees. This year's first-year students from Wales who study in other parts of the UK could take more than £33m in Welsh government support with them. Including last year's students, the total figure is more than £50m. Earlier this year, universities in Wales told BBC Wales they were not on an even playing field with institutions in other parts of the UK.",A review of university fee subsidies is being deliberately timed to report after the 2016 assembly election the education minister has said.
"By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter Saif al-Islam studied at the LSE from 2003 to 2008, gaining both a Master of Science degree and a doctorate. But allegations have emerged that he used a ghost writer, and copied sections of his thesis. In 2009, he pledged a £1.5m donation to the LSE from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. The LSE's involvement with the Libya prompted student protests last week. In a statement, the university said: ""LSE is aware that there are allegations of plagiarism concerning the PhD thesis of Saif Gaddafi. ""The School takes all allegations of plagiarism very seriously, and is looking into the matter in accordance with standard LSE procedures."" Embarrassment On Monday, LSE director Sir Howard Davies, admitted he felt ""embarrassed"" by the university's ties with the family of Colonel Gaddafi. He said the decision to accept research funding from a foundation controlled by Saif Gaddafi had ""backfired"". He also expressed regret that he had visited Libya to advise the regime about how it could modernise its financial institutions. Sir Howard, who is a former head of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the decision to accept £300,000 from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation had been debated ""extensively"" within the LSE. Last week the university said it was reconsidering its links with Libya ""as a matter of urgency."" But that did not appease angry students. Last Wednesday a dozen students stormed his offices, demanding the £300,000 of the £1.5m donation already accepted be ""paid back"" to the Libyan people. There were also protests outside the School, as students gathered to express their concerns.",The London School of Economics has confirmed it is investigating allegations that Colonel Gaddafi's son plagiarised his PhD thesis.
"The birds of prey, the UK's largest, arrived from Norway in June for the fourth year of the East Scotland Sea Eagle reintroduction project It is a partnership scheme between RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland. Since their arrival, the birds have been reared in specially built aviaries. They will now join Scotland's growing white-tailed eagle population and help restore this species to their former range in the east of Scotland. This project is also contributing to wider conservation efforts across Europe for sea eagles. The birds were driven to extinction in the UK by game preservers and collectors in the Victorian era, with the last individual bird killed in 1916. They only returned to the UK following a successful reintroduction to the West of Scotland, on the Island of Rum in 1975. Impressive bird Claire Smith, RSPB Scotland east coast sea eagle project officer, said: ""A diet of pike, haddock and roe deer has helped make sure these birds are fit and ready for life in the wild. Each bird has been fitted with a radio and wing tags so both project staff and the public can follow their progress. ""Already we receive many calls from the public thrilled to have seen a sea eagle on the east coast."" Susan Davies, director of policy at Scottish National Heritage, added: ""These new recruits will help ensure that this impressive bird's future, as an important part of Scotland's biodiversity, is secured.""",Nineteen white-tailed sea eagles have been released into the wild from a secret location in Fife.
"Counting is continuing and the first results have come in, with Sinn Féin winning the most first preference votes. With all first preferences counted, it has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna Fáil and 20.9% for Fine Gael. No one party will win enough seats for an outright majority. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil ruled out forming a government with Sinn Féin, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday evening taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin did not rule out working with Sinn Féin, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Polling in the election closed at 22:00 local time on Saturday. Ballot boxes from across the 39 constituencies were opened at 09:00 on Sunday. Many counts have finished for the night and will resume at 10:00 on Monday, but some are continuing. Sinn Féin ran 42 candidates across the 39 multi-seat constituencies, about half that of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which will have a knock-on effect on the number of seats it can secure in the 160-seat Dáil (Irish parliament) where 80 seats are needed for a majority. What kind of government could be formed? Once the final number of seats for each party is known, leaders will try to form a coalition government in order to avoid another general election. Before the election both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil said they would not enter coalition with Sinn Féin. Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was exploring options to see if it would be possible to form a government without either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said his party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn Féin ""in large part because of their policies in relation to crime, tax and the way the economy and society should be run and also our deep concerns about their democratic structures. ""We don't believe a coalition between Sinn Féin and Fine Gael is a viable option,"" he said. He said a ""forced marriage would not result in a good government."" Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin did not rule out working with Sinn Féin, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. He said reports suggested that his party ""would be the largest"". He added that he was a ""democrat"" and respected the vote of the people. What could Sinn Féin's surge mean for the overall result? Following the last election in 2016 Sinn Féin had 23 seats in the Dáil (Irish parliament). There are 160 seats up for election this time around, and Sinn Féin is set to dramatically increase how many it holds after it won the most first preference votes. Ms McDonald said this election was about ""change"". She topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency. ""The frustration people have felt for a long time with the two-party system, whereby Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil handed the baton of power between each other - that's now over,"" she said. ""We now have a very substantial mandate."" She said she was exploring options to see to see if it was possible to form a government without Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. 'No part of the country untouched by Sinn Féin's surge' By Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Sunday evening is seeing a cascade of results from across the country. Many early victories have gone to Sinn Féin - with no part of the country looking untouched by the party's surge. While the general picture is becoming clear - the final numbers will be determined by the process of numerical preferences trickling down through the various stages of the counts. Sinn Féin surpluses will be very much in play here - as the party was only running one candidate in many constituencies, the destination of the transfers from the successful runners is set to have an impact on what other parties take the seats. The latest seat projection by University College Dublin, for RTÉ, puts Fianna Fail as the largest party on 45 seats - with Sinn Féin on 37 and Fine Gael on 36. Plenty of counting is still to come. How is Fine Gael performing? Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and with a confidence and supply deal with Fianna Fáil. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first precence votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. Party leader Leo Varadkar reiterated that he did not want to enter into government with Sinn Féin and said Ms McDonald had not been in contact with him. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was now clear there was now a ""three-party system"". Will Fianna Fáil return to government? Fianna Fáil has been in government for more years than anyone else since Ireland became independent, but it has not been the ruling party since 2011. Earlier on Sunday Micheál Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days. He said there was a lot of ""volatility"", adding people who could not get elected in the local elections had been successful in this one. He said the most important thing when forming a government was ""compatibility in the programme for government"" and that formation of a government was going to be very difficult. Mr Martin added he was a ""democrat"" and respected the will of the people. Despite previously saying he would not govern with Sinn Féin he has now not ruled that out. What about the smaller parties? The Green Party is also set to increase the number of seats it holds. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected on the first count for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. Ruth Coppinger from the left wing alliance Solidarity-People Before Profit lost her seat. Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said it had not been a good day for his party as it had been squeezed by Sinn Féin. The party's former leader Joan Burton lost her seat in Dublin West. She was first elected to the Dáil in 1992. The Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said it was ""historic,"" saying there had been a ""seismic shift"". She said she knew there was a wind in the Sinn Féin sail. The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). Aontú (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. An exit poll - commissioned jointly by Irish national broadcasters RTÉ and TG4, as well as The Irish Times and University College Dublin suggested a move toward Sinn Féin among younger voters, with the party receiving the largest number of first preference votes among 18-24 years olds (31.8%). The majority of voters over the age of 65 appear to have given their first preference to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. What voting system does the Republic of Ireland use? Ireland's elections are carried out under the proportional representation (PR) voting system, using the single transferable vote (STV). Voters wrote ""1"" opposite their first choice candidate, ""2"" opposite their second choice, ""3"" opposite their third choice and so on. This means that the picture presented when the first preference votes are counted does not completely reflect the final outcome. What happens next? Newly elected TDs will gather on 20 February . The ceann comhairle, or speaker, is automatically re-elected. In most situations, the speaker does not vote, so a government will need 80 TDs to hold a majority.","Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has described the Irish general election as ""something of a revolution in the ballot box""."
"Hai Ngo, 23, is studying for a masters degree in international business at Nottingham Trent University. He boarded a flight to see family in Vietnam in March, just as the country began quarantining all arrivals. After a two-week stay at the camp, Mr Ngo and a man he shared a room with are now planning to feed staff at a Covid-19 reaction hospital and military base. At the camp in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr Ngo helped people from 13 countries including the US, Italy and Bangladesh. He and Frank Chinn, a restaurant owner from the US, then took 50 meals to the camp where they stayed to feed the doctors and nurses providing care. Vietnam's first coronavirus case was confirmed on 23 January. By mid March, it became compulsory for anyone arriving in Vietnam to spend two weeks at a quarantine camp. Mr Ngo said: ""There were dozens of people at my facility - migrant workers and expats who had come to Vietnam to work. ""They were all confused because there was a lack of English translation. We were the only source of information for the foreigners."" Mr Ngo said he had to contact his friend from the university to get help with translating for some Bangladeshi workers, who were trying to explain they needed Halal meals. Mr Chinn, 78, said: ""He [Mr Ngo] was very helpful, he's a really dedicated young man and is a tribute to his university.""

"Two local residents have raised the flags ahead of the US presidential hopeful's visit to Scotland later this week. They said they wanted to ""show solidarity"" with the people of Mexico. It comes after Mr Trump outlined plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border to stop illegal immigrants. Trump International Golf Links was opened by the businessman in 2012, after a lengthy battle with local people and environmentalists. One of the flags has been raised by Michael Forbes, who refused to sell his land on the Menie Estate to Mr Trump before the course opened. A second flag is being flown alongside a Saltire by David Milne, who lives in a former coastguard station overlooking the 18-hole course. Mr Trump will return to Scotland on Friday to officially open the revamped Turnberry course in Ayrshire, which he also owns. He is also expected to visit the Aberdeenshire course during his trip to Scotland. Mr Milne said: ""I am currently flying a Mexican flag along with my usual Saltire just for solidarity along with those worldwide who Trump has decried, insulted and threatened over the years, and will continue to decry, insult and threaten."" He said there were no plans to hold a protest during Mr Trump's visit. ""We don't think he's worth the effort,"" he said. But he said the flag would be visible from the clubhouse. ""It's just enough to remind him that where he tried to drive us out he failed completely on that front.""",Mexican flags are flying on properties surrounding the controversial Aberdeenshire golf course owned by Donald Trump.

"Jack Lopresti said a letter sent to party members calling for a new candidate was part of an ""attempt to destroy my character and reputation"". The Filton and Bradley Stoke MP left his wife for fellow MP Andrea Jenkyns, who gave birth to their son in March. Mr Lopresti was reselected at a meeting on Friday evening. An anonymous letter sent to Conservative Party members in the constituency earlier this month said there were ""many of us who feel very strongly that Mr Lopresti is not representing our constituency in a very good way"". It added there were ""several excellent people"" who should be given the chance to become the prospective parliamentary candidate. The local party has reacted to the letter by writing to party members assuring that ""appropriate legal action"" would be taken if the writer was identified. He was first elected in 2010 and re-elected with a near-10,000 majority five years later.

"There was ""wind in the sails"" of those opposing Brexit and the consequences for the party will be ""devastating"", if it is not delivered, he said. MPs will vote again on the deal on Tuesday, after rejecting it in January. Labour's John McDonnell said it looked like the PM had failed to secure any changes and it would be rejected again. The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. MPs will vote for a second time on Tuesday on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the European Union - after rejecting it by a historic margin in January. If they reject it again, they will get a vote on leaving without a deal, and if that fails, on delaying the exit date. Many Conservative Brexiteers voted against the deal in January over concerns about the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But there have been few visible signs of progress over the issue in continuing talks between EU and UK officials. 'Perilous waters' Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show some MPs wanted to ""kill"" the deal, in order to delay Brexit, with the ultimate aim of getting another referendum on the issue. ""Within three weeks, those people could have two of those three things,"" he said, adding that Labour's position made the third more likely. He said: ""We are in very perilous waters, and people who want to make sure that we really do deliver this result need to remember that if it fails... they are going to say: 'There was a party that promised to deliver Brexit, we put them into No 10 and they failed', and the consequences for us as a party, would be devastating."" He added: ""We have an opportunity now to leave on March 29, or shortly thereafter. And it's very important that we grasp that opportunity because there is wind in the sails of people trying to stop Brexit."" If Parliament approves Mrs May's withdrawal agreement next week and the UK leaves the EU on 29 March, it will begin a transition period, when the two sides will attempt to agree a comprehensive trade deal. If a trade deal is not agreed by the end of the transition period, the ""backstop"" plan is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. But some MPs fear that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. On Friday, Mrs May urged the EU to help her get the deal through by resolving concerns about the backstop. But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: ""It looks as though she's bringing back the same deal so it looks as though we will have the same result and it will be thrown out."" He said the party's priority this week would be to stop Theresa May ""driving through some sort of Brexit deal that will damage our economy and undermine jobs"" and if that meant a delay to allow for a discussion about the deal Labour backs instead ""so be it"". He also denied that Labour's support for keeping the option of another referendum open had been put on the backburner, adding: ""If Parliament can't agree, if we have to break the logjam, yes, we will keep the option available of going back to the people."" And he said he believed that Labour's alternative Brexit deal could be agreed with the EU ""within a matter of weeks"" but said any delay requested should be ""as long as is necessary"". Labour's policy is to seek a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr McDonnell said the EU had ""looked positively"" on the proposal. On Friday, the EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances it has already made about the withdrawal deal and its chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK would be free to leave a proposed single customs territory with the EU - provided Northern Ireland remained within it. The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said she was deeply disappointed by the EU's proposal, which has already been rejected by the UK government.

"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent The Iranian military is said to have established a compound at a site used by the Syrian army outside El-Kiswah, 14 km (8 miles) south of Damascus. The report comes amid growing tensions over Iranian influence in Syria and across the region. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu recently warned that Iran wanted to establish itself militarily in Syria. ""Israel will not let that happen,"" he said. Satellite images commissioned by the BBC seem to show construction activity at the site referenced by the intelligence source between January and October this year. The images show a series of two dozen large low-rise buildings - likely for housing soldiers and vehicles. In recent months, additional buildings have been added to the site. However, it is impossible to independently verify the purpose of the site and the presence of the Iranian military. An official from another Western country told the BBC that ambitions for such a long-term presence in Syria would not be illogical for Iran. Its adversaries have accused Iran of seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to the Shia Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. With so-called Islamic State (IS) suffering major defeats on the battlefield and losing its last strongholds, attention is increasingly turning to what comes next and the new map of power and influence in Syria. Iran has been a consistent backer of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Photographs published on social media in the past few days also showed a senior Iranian general in Deir al-Zour shortly after IS was driven out of the town. The photos show Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) alongside members of a militia. With a significant number of IRGC fighting - and in some cases dying - in Syria, there has already been a significant presence in the country but the question is now whether they are preparing to remain in the long term. The images of the base do not reveal any signs of large or unconventional weaponry which means if it was a base it would most likely be to house soldiers and vehicles. One source said it was possible that senior Iranian military officials may have visited the compound in recent weeks. Independent analysis of the images commissioned by the BBC says the facility is military in nature. The analysis also suggests there are a series of garages that can hold six to eight vehicles each. The analysis suggests new buildings have been constructed and other buildings renovated in the past six months although the exact role of the new structures cannot be determined. However, it is not clear whether the facility is currently occupied. Shia fighters from other countries - including Pakistan and Afghanistan - are also alleged to be operating in Syria under the control of the IRGC and it is possible the base could be used by them. Analysts estimate up to 500 troops could be based at the site. The presence of Iranian forces in Syria has been reported for some time but the claim of a potentially more permanent Iranian base raises the possibility of military action by Israel which has repeatedly warned it will not tolerate such a development. The base lies about 50 km (31 miles) from the Golan Heights - Syrian territory occupied and then annexed by Israel and where it now has a significant military presence. ""As Isis [IS] moves out, Iran moves in,"" Mr Netanyahu tweeted on Sunday. ""Iran wants to establish itself militarily in Syria, right next to Israel. Israel will not let that happen,"" he added. In an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on the same day he said Iran wanted to bring its air force and submarines as well as military divisions right next to Israel. Israel has raised further concerns of Iran seeking to use Syrian ports and bases for its submarines. When asked whether Israel would use military force to stop such developments, Mr Netanyahu told the BBC: ""You know, the more we're prepared to stop it, the less likely we'll have to resort to much greater things. There is a principle I very much adhere to, which is to nip bad things in the bud."" However, international pressure is likely to be the first avenue pursued by Israel. Other countries have also raised concerns over potential long-term Iranian presence in the region. The issue of potential Iranian military bases is likely to have been raised by Israeli officials with Syria's ally Russia. In October, Russia's defence minister was in Jerusalem and was told by Mr Netanyahu that Israel would not allow the Iranian military ""to gain a foothold in Syria"", according to reports at the time. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Iran in the past week and Russian media suggested Syria - including Iran's influence in the country - would be on the agenda. In recent years, the Israeli air force has struck targets in Syria a number of times which it has linked to Hezbollah.

"Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since Tuesday, when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish sources quoted by Reuters and the Washington Post say they believe he has been killed inside the consulate. They did not give any evidence for the claim, nor suggest how he was killed. Saudi officials have not yet commented, however a source at the consulate - also quoted by Reuters - described the accusations as baseless. The source added that a security team had arrived in Istanbul to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Earlier, Prince bin Salman told Bloomberg News that Turkish authorities were welcome to search the building. What is Turkey doing? Turkish media said prosecutors were now looking closely at the case, although this may be a widening of an inquiry begun on Tuesday. The two unnamed sources said on Saturday that the initial assessment of police was that Mr Khashoggi had been killed at the consulate. ""We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,"" one of the sources told Reuters. A source quoted by The Washington Post said the journalist was killed by a 15-member Saudi team sent ""specifically for the murder"". The BBC's Mark Lowen says that, if confirmed, the state-sponsored murder on Turkish soil of a high-profile Saudi dissident would worsen already strained relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey has taken the side of Qatar over its blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours, and Turkey's rapprochement with Iran has riled the government in Riyadh. Reuters earlier quoted the Turkish ruling party as saying the investigation would be comprehensive and that the government's sensitivity about the case was at the ""highest level"". The AK Party said Mr Khashoggi's whereabouts would be uncovered. The head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association told the New York Times that Turkish police officers providing security for the consulate had checked their security cameras and did not see the journalist leave on foot. But Turan Kislakci added that diplomatic cars had been seen moving in and out. On Wednesday, the Turkish foreign ministry summoned Saudi Arabia's ambassador and asked for an explanation about the disappearance. What have the Saudis said? Prince bin Salman told Bloomberg: ""He's a Saudi citizen and we are very keen to know what happened to him. And we will continue our dialogue with the Turkish government to see what happened to Jamal there. ""My understanding is he entered and he got out after a few minutes or one hour. I'm not sure. We are investigating this through the foreign ministry to see exactly what happened at that time. ""The premises are sovereign territory, but we will allow them to enter and search and do whatever they want to do. If they ask for that, of course, we will allow them. We have nothing to hide."" When asked if Mr Khashoggi faced charges in Saudi Arabia, the crown prince said his country would need to know where he was first. What happened on Tuesday? Mr Khashoggi went to the consulate to obtain a document certifying he had divorced his ex-wife, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice, who went with him to the building and waited outside, but did not see him leave. She said that he was ""stressed and sad"" that he was forced to go to the building. He was required to surrender his mobile phone, which is standard practice in some diplomatic missions. Hatice said he left the phone with her and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not return. She said she waited for him outside the consulate from about 13:00 (10:00 GMT) until after midnight and did not see him leave. She returned when the consulate reopened on Wednesday morning. Why might Saudi Arabia want to hold Khashoggi? The 59-year-old journalist is one of the most prominent critics of the crown prince, who has unveiled reforms praised by the West while carrying out an apparent crackdown on dissent, which has seen human and women's rights activists, intellectuals and clerics arrested, and waging a war in Yemen that has triggered a humanitarian crisis. A former editor of the al-Watan newspaper and a short-lived Saudi TV news channel, Mr Khashoggi was for years seen as close to the Saudi royal family. He served as an adviser to senior Saudi officials. After several of his friends were arrested, his column was cancelled by the al-Hayat newspaper and he was allegedly warned to stop tweeting, Mr Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia for the US, from where he wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and continued to appear on Arab and Western TV channels. ""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,"" he wrote in September 2017. ""To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot."" The Washington Post on Friday blanked out his column in support.",Turkish prosecutors have opened an investigation into the disappearance of a missing Saudi journalist.

"By M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad Pakistan's Supreme Court has issued an order to officials in the north-western district of Karak to pave the way for rebuilding the Sri Param Hansji Maharaj Samadhi temple, but the attack has left the country's Hindus feeling vulnerable and the government facing accusations that it is failing to protect the country's religious minorities. Pakistan is overwhelmingly Muslim - the Hindu community makes up less than 2% of the population. Prejudice against Hindus is ingrained. The Hindus who attend the Sri Param Hansji Maharaj Samadhi were still in the process of rebuilding the site after the first attack, in 1997, after the Supreme Court finally issued a rebuilding order in 2015. But in the process, the community bought and began renovating an adjacent house to provide a resting place for Hindu pilgrims - setting off a wave of anger among local Muslims convinced that the temple was being expanded. In December, a rally was convened that was quickly whipped into a destructive mob. How did the attack unfold? The rally was convened on 30 December near the temple, and led by a local Muslim cleric, Maulvi Mohammad Sharif, who is affiliated with the religious party Jamiate Ulemae Islam and was the same cleric who led the attack on the temple in 1997. According to witnesses, the cleric whipped up the crowd, inciting rally goers who then smashed in the walls of the temple with sledgehammers and set fire to it. A report compiled by Pakistan's Commission for Minority Rights after the attack found that precious ornaments were destroyed, as were ornate wooden doors and windows made from Burma teak and the carved white marble of the grave of a Hindu saint. ""The overall picture ... was of utter devastation,"" the report said. Police and security guards had been stationed at the temple during the rally but failed to stop the mob. ""They went with impunity,"" said the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Gulzar Ahmed, after the attack, adding that the incident had caused ""international embarrassment to Pakistan"". Police arrested 109 people in relation to the attack, including Maulvi Mohammad Sharif, and suspended 92 police officials, including the superintendent of police and deputy superintendent of police who were on duty at the time. ""There were 92 police officials at the spot, but they showed cowardice and negligence,"" admitted Sanaullah Abbasi, the local police inspector general. There were no Hindus at the temple at the time - they travel to the site for religious purposes but none live at the site - and no-one was injured or killed. Why is there a dispute? Located in Teri village on a desert patch featuring dry hills, the temple was built in 1919, long before the British partition of India pushed many Hindus south to India and many Muslims north into newly-created Pakistan. The site was the last resting place of Sri Param Hansji Maharaj, a Hindu saint who has a large following in Pakistan, India and elsewhere in the world. Waseem Khatak, a researcher, teacher and journalist from the village, said the area had a large Hindu population which was mainly involved in trade, business and money-lending, and Hindus and Muslims lived side by side in a collective culture. Sri Param Hansji Maharaj ""knew the Quran by heart"", Mr Khatak said, ""and would offer spiritual guidance to his Muslim followers by quoting from the book"". Hindus made pilgrimages to the site from all over, but when the British instigated partition in 1947 the entire Hindu population of Teri village left, abandoning their properties. The government set up a trust to take over and manage the properties they had left behind and occasional pilgrimages continued. The property of the shrine was left in the care of a disciple of the saint, who converted to Islam and became the caretaker. But after the caretaker's death in the 1960s, his sons sold the place to two local Muslim families. Access to the tomb became an arduous task - pilgrims had to pass through the privacy of two family homes to perform their rituals. In the mid-1990s, the community bought one of the houses for easy access to the tomb. But the purchase happened at a time when local Muslim clerics enjoyed considerable influence with the Pakistani establishment. In 1996, soon after the news about the house deal was broken to the clergy, Maulvi Mohammad Sharif declared the Hindu community ""agents of the US and India"" and led a mob to destroy the temple. The destruction sparked a series of court cases that continued until 2015, when the Supreme Court finally ordered the restoration of the shrine, though on a much smaller piece of land inside one of the two houses. Even then, the local government continued to delay funds for reconstruction. Frustrated, the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) rebuilt the shrine and widened and paved the street leading to it, paying from its own coffers. What happens next? As well as ordering the reconstruction of the temple, the Supreme Court has asked the local authorities to take tougher action against the police officials who were on duty during the attack. One of the suspended policemen - who requested anonymity - told the BBC that the local police had intelligence reports before the attack that trouble was likely, but no-one thought it was worthwhile to counter the clergy. ""Given the developments in the region, the clerics are still relevant to our state policy,"" he said. ""If we cross their path, we may risk our jobs. So unless there are very clear instructions from above, we don't do that. And this allows the more ambitious among them to take advantage."" Members of the Hindu community say that restoration of a temple alone will not restore harmony. That would begin with changes to the education curriculum, which they say promotes apathy, even callousness towards non-Muslims. ""It is the failure of the system that a purely local dispute which could easily have been resolved in the light of the law and the constitution spiralled into a national and then an international issue,"" said Haroon Sarab Diyal, a Hindu community leader based in Peshawar. Just a week before the attack on the temple in December, a meeting of Pakistan's Commission for Minority Rights concluded that a ""visible improvement in the treatment of minorities"" was needed in Pakistan. In a report issued after the attack, the commission concluded that there was still a way to go.",A century-old sacred Hindu shrine in Pakistan was destroyed by a Muslim mob in December - the second ransacking and desecration of the holy site.
"Citiscape in Croydon was one of 228 buildings to fail safety tests after the disaster which claimed 71 lives. Leaseholders argued that the building's management company, FirstPort, should pay to remove the aluminium composite material panels. A spokesman for FirstPort said they would ""work to minimise"" the cost. Despite the ruling, resident Anuj Vats said it is still unclear when the cladding will be removed. He said: ""The property manager has made it clear they won't start any work until they have all the money in their reserve funds. So we are stuck with increasing costs of fire marshals and no date of these works actually starting. ""Every individual has a different financial situation, but the cost for my one-bedroom flat that I own would be around £15,000 or £16,000. ""Suddenly I've got this huge bill."" A spokesman for FirstPort said it was a ""difficult situation"" for everyone involved, but the firm would ""work to minimise"" the costs of recladding. He said: ""We brought this case before the Tribunal not in conflict with residents, but to receive an independent judgment on the most appropriate way to ensure their safety in the long term. ""We will continue to work with all parties to provide further assistance to residents, but we must begin these essential safety works.

"By Peter BowesBBC News, Los Angeles A face-to-face meeting with an opportunity to look a potential employer in the eye can work wonders. ""I feel human contact is the best way to interact with a person and to really get the feel for that person's personality, their abilities and interpersonal skills,"" says Sheri Bennett, a former teacher looking for a job in California. After having no success with more than 200 online applications, Ms Bennett attended a job fair because she felt she could be more persuasive face to face with a recruiter. ""If somebody has the opportunity to look at you in the eyes, they have the opportunity to shake your hand and know if you have a weak handshake or a firm handshake,"" she says. 'I can hire on the spot' Job fairs allow candidates to leapfrog over the initial stages of applying for a job. They expedite the process for both the jobseeker and the employer, cutting out an initial online application, a possible phone screening process and the endless waiting for an interview date. ""It's valuable to go to career fairs for the face to face aspect, but to do research on companies or on industries or where the openings are at, there's so much more you can do now to ready yourself for that first interview,"" says Dan Sparks, vice-president of sales at Hire Live, a recruitment service in the US. At a recent event in Pasadena, California, the hiring firms included a car rental company, a solar provider, a memorial park and an insurance company. Jobseekers were first interviewed by a company recruiter and then, in some cases, a manager. ""I can hire on the spot if I want to,"" says Michael Vaccaro, a district sales manager with Sears. The department store had a position for a salesperson to go into people's homes and give presentations on home improvement projects. But Mr Vaccaro says such jobs are not easy to fill. He says the dearth in talent means employers are often vying for the best candidates. For jobseekers determined to find a new position, it is an opportunity to make a good first impression. Do your homework ""Some are very prepared,"" says Mr Sparks. He says candidates should attend events knowing which companies are going to be there, what they have to offer and what positions they're looking for. ""Go onto their websites, learn a little bit about that company,"" he says. ""They can even bring what we call a brag book with them and so they can say, 'I was top 10% at my last company, I made president's club, I did this, I did that.' You can show your proof that you're good at what you do."" He says it leaves a recruiter with a good impression. ""They just think that this person knows what they want, this person is articulate, this person has already researched it, this is the candidate that we want to move forward with."" Biggest mistake But job fairs, with the allure of instant success, also attract candidates who are ill-prepared. ""The biggest mistake is probably walking in and saying, 'I need a job,'"" says Mr Sparks. ""Not 'I want to be a sales person,' it's just, 'I need a job, times are hard right now and I just need a job.'"" He says candidates must have a plan and be focused on what they want. They should know the kind of work they want to do and have an idea of the geographical area they can operate in. A better approach would be: ""'I want to be a salesperson, I like inside sales or I like outside sales. I want to work within a 30-mile radius of here. I want to be in this industry.' ""You can be open to different industries and open to sales, but you can't just walk in and tell a recruiter, 'I want a job'. Right when you say that, it doesn't matter what happens after that, they are not going to think about you after you leave.""",Online job applications and CVs are becoming increasingly common - but you can still land a job by going to meet employers and asking about work.
"The bear is suspected of killing a 74-year-old woman whose badly mauled body was found on Friday near Kazuno in mountainous Akita prefecture. Three men also died in apparent bear attacks in the area in recent weeks. All had been foraging for wild plants. Locals have been warned to stay away from the area. Police and firefighters are also mounting daily patrols in the mountains, encouraging anyone found to leave. The female black bear was shot dead on Friday a short distance from the spot where the woman's body was found. Hideki Abe, an Akita prefectural official, told AFP a ""piece of human flesh"" was found inside the bear's stomach when it was examined. But he said it was not yet confirmed whether that particular bear was responsible for the woman's death. ""Two thirds of the stomach was filled with bamboo shoots,"" he said, which indicated that little human flesh was consumed by the bear, and that it may not have been alone in carrying out the attacks. He said no bears had been captured in the traps set up in Kazuno city. Many Japanese go into the mountains at this time of year to harvest bamboo shoots, which are also a staple food for bears. Bear attacks on humans in the region are not unusual, but fatal ones are. Only eight bear deaths have been counted from 1979 through to last year on Japan's main island of Honshu.","Human flesh and hair have been found inside the stomach of a black bear shot dead in Japan after a series of deadly attacks, say local officials."
"By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News Business for Britain, which wants the UK to leave the EU, says more than 60% of UK law is influenced by EU law. Robert Oxley from Vote Leave says, ""If you stacked the entire EU rule book it would be higher than Nelson's column. That's an incredible amount of paperwork which British businesses, British employers, all the people who have to comply with this legislation have to deal with. It is cost and time added on to their businesses."" But some put the figure far lower, at around 13%. So who is right? In a nutshell it's somewhere in-between the two - let's look at why. To try to work out the proportion of UK law derived from EU law, you need to define what you mean by UK law and EU law, understand how they relate to one another, and only then ""do the math"". So, what is meant by UK law? That's tricky because the devolved legislatures in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all pass laws that apply only in their nations, and not all laws passed at Westminster apply to the entire UK. Essentially, there are two main kinds of UK law. Acts of Parliament, also known as statutes, and statutory instruments, which flesh out how a statute will work. There are also two main types of EU law. There are EU regulations, most of which apply automatically in all 28 EU member states - so most EU regulations are part of UK law. Then there are EU directives, which set out an aim for member states to achieve. They don't specify how to achieve it, but directives have to be implemented by a national law. The UK normally does this through a statutory instrument. Okay, got the terms straight? Let's start the number crunching. Doing the sums According to the House of Commons Library, which itself concedes that there is no completely accurate way to make the calculation, between 1993 and 2014 Parliament passed 945 Acts of which 231 implemented EU obligations of some sort. It also passed 33,160 Statutory Instruments, 4,283 of which implemented EU obligations. Add both of these together and divide by the total number of laws passed, and you get the 13% figure. But that's not really an accurate figure because most EU regulations don't require new UK laws. They can be implemented in the UK without new legislation, for example by simply changing administrative rules. So, the 13% figure doesn't take into account EU regulations that don't need additional UK legislation to be brought into force. If you count all EU regulations, EU-related Acts of Parliament, and EU-related Statutory Instruments, about 62% of laws introduced between 1993 and 2014 that apply in the UK implemented EU obligations. So, does that mean that the Brexiteers are right? Not according to many expert lawyers and academics. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, some EU regulations, like those governing tobacco and olive oil production, are agreed by all member states but don't actually affect us at all because we don't have those industries here. We also adopt some EU regulations that simply codify existing UK law at a European level. In other words, we would have that law anyway. But perhaps the biggest way in which it is said the 62% is inflated is because it includes within it what are known as non-legislative EU regulations, which concern matters so small or routine that many people wouldn't really recognise them as law. Diarrhoea in pigs Research by Michael Dougan, professor of EU law at Liverpool University looked at all of the EU regulations published in the Official Journal for October 2015. He counted 119 EU regulations, but only eight of them were legislative in character, of which two were measures relating to the EU's own budget and another two were amending measures. The remaining 111 regulations (over 93%) were non-legislative acts, made up of detailed technical administrative decisions, such as updating the scientific registers of chemicals and food additives, and extending the protection period for measures to combat diarrhoea in pigs. Other months yielded similar results. It is claimed that this kind of analysis demonstrates how misleading the 62% figure is. ""It is only possible to reach a figure anywhere approaching 60% by entirely ignoring the fundamental distinction between EU legislation and EU administration, thereby massively exaggerating the statistics for the amount of EU law, by including vast numbers of detailed, technical measures that would never be counted as law if they were adopted within the UK legal system,"" Professor Dougan says. So what is the true figure? More than 13% but less than 62% - it depends what you count in and what you leave out. It is safe to say that EU law does have a very significant presence and effect in UK law. But is there any point in counting the number of laws? Not according to Sir Paul Jenkins, a former Treasury solicitor who headed up the Government Legal Department. He thinks the whole debate is a red herring. ""This is one of many areas in the EU debate where both sides describe meaningless nonsense as facts,"" he says. ""The impact of EU law varies from sector to sector. In many areas - public order, crime, defence, health - EU laws have minimal impact. But in others - workers' rights, trade - the impact is much greater because the single market and the free movement of workers are at the heart of what the EU is about. The way we organise our NHS is not.""

"The CCTV footage shows six people walking near the 29-year-old Drogheda native prior to her disappearance. They have all been urged to come forward. The detective leading the investigation said police are keen to talk to a man who appears to be talking to Mrs Meagher in part of the footage. Det Insp John Potter, said: ""We're interested in talking to anyone that was in the Sydney Road area in the early hours of Saturday morning and may have seen Jillian, or indeed anyone that knows who the people in the footage are. ""We're particularly interested in talking to a man in a blue top that's depicted in the footage who appears to be talking to Jillian."" Det Insp Potter told journalists that detectives did not know whether the man knew Mrs Meagher, but that it appeared to be a casual conversation. The apartment that Mrs Meagher shared with her husband Tom was searched twice on Tuesday, but Det Insp Potter said that Mr Meagher is not being treated ""in any way"" as a suspect and there are no other suspects at this stage. Police said they have grave concerns for Mrs Meagher's safety five days after her disappearance. Det Insp Potter added: ""She hasn't been heard of since the early hours of Saturday morning and it's now Wednesday. She hasn't accessed her bank records since that time. ""There's been no word from her mobile phone and with all the media coverage on this, we do hold grave concerns for her welfare."" Police launched a major investigation after Mrs Meagher went missing and they say they are working through hours of CCTV footage. Det Insp Potter said: ""Investigators are continuing to work through a large amount of CCTV footage. ""We're also conducting other inquiries and investigations. We currently have 140 calls to Crimestoppers, which we need to scrutinise thoroughly."" Mrs Meagher is known to have phoned her brother in Perth from 01:43 to 01:45 local time just after the footage ends. The handbag she is seen carrying in the footage was found in a nearby lane on Monday morning and police believe it may have been planted there. Mrs Meagher works for ABC radio and had been out for the night with work colleagues. She moved with her husband to Australia from Ireland three years ago.","Melbourne police have released CCTV images of Irish woman Jill Meagher, taken minutes before her disappearance in the early hours of Saturday."

A spokeswoman for Essex Police said one PC received management action but there was no misconduct case to answer for any of the officers involved. 'In hospital for weeks' The woman's son called 999 to report that his mother had not returned home. After 90 minutes had passed, the acting inspector assigned the call as a missing person investigation, the IOPC said. ""Two officers attended the house, met with the son, and undertook a brief search, but did not look in all the rooms or garage.

The watchdog said the officers were tasked by the force control room to search the property but the duty sergeant was not made aware. Only the bedroom was searched but the officers noted in police records that the house was searched. The IOPC did not state where in Essex the incident happened. It recommended the force should ""ensure that there is a process for the duty sergeant to be notified when officers have been tasked to undertake actions in a missing person report"". A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: ""Following the IOPC investigation and recommendations of sanction one PC received management action although there was no misconduct case to answer for any of the three officers involved.

"The Women and Equalities Committee is calling for a German-style system, where it is harder to make women redundant during and after pregnancy. The number of expectant and new mothers forced to leave their jobs has almost doubled to 54,000 since 2005, it said. The government said it would consider the recommendations carefully. In Germany, from the beginning of pregnancy until four months following childbirth, employers can only dismiss an employee in very rare cases - such as the company going bust - and it needs government approval to do so. In the UK, although it is illegal to dismiss a woman for reasons relating to having a child, a company can find other reasons for making her redundant. 'Unacceptable discrimination' Other recommendations from the report include more protection for casual, agency and zero-hours workers - such as making it easier for women to attend antenatal appointments. It also suggested a ""substantial reduction"" in the £1,200 fee for women taking a pregnancy-related discrimination case to an employment tribunal - and recommended the three-month limit on taking cases to a tribunal should be doubled to six months. 'Hugely stressful process' Sarah, an expectant mum who works for the NHS, said: ""I have been treated so poorly I've had to consider leaving. I've had various issues with obtaining equipment my employers have identified I need resulting in me sitting on a broken chair for two months of my pregnancy. ""I've been to occupational health and my managers, and was advised to ""go off sick"" until my maternity leave starts even though my baby is not due for another three months."" Another mum, who is seven months pregnant and was facing the threat of redundancy said: ""I have spent around two months of my pregnancy fighting my employer. I have been successful, but have very little confidence that when I return to work they will offer me my current job, never mind any flexibility - and I work in a female-dominated industry. ""Having gone through what I have just done, I don't think law changes will help at all. There was almost no support I could get that would actually help me keep my job. ""I had to have time off work and was crying every day. I love my job, but now I don't want to work for the managers who did this to me. ""But I do want other women to know that you can win on your own. It's hard work and emotionally draining, but it can be done."" The report cited research from the former Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which found that 11% of women reported being either dismissed, made redundant when others in their workplace were not, or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their job. ""There are now record numbers of women in work in the UK,"" said the committee's chairwoman, Maria Miller. ""The economy will suffer unless employers modernise their workplace practices to ensure effective support and protection for expectant and new mums."" She added that the government's approach had lacked ""urgency and bite"" and that the work to combat this ""unacceptable discrimination"" needed to be underpinned by concrete targets and changes to laws. 'Outdated attitudes' The report also called for government assurances that rights and protections would not be eroded, given the uncertainty following the vote to leave the European Union. Business Minister Margot James said: ""It is completely unacceptable that pregnant women and new mothers are apparently being forced to quit their jobs because of outdated attitudes. ""Tackling this issue is a key priority of mine and this government and I would like to thank the committee for its important work. We will consider its recommendations carefully and respond in due course."" What are your rights? The law says it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably - for example, not giving her a promotion or reducing pay - because she's pregnant or has recently given birth. This protection lasts from when you become pregnant to the end of your maternity leave. If you think you have a case: Claire Dawson, head of employment at law firm Slater and Gordon, said the company regularly acts for clients who have been made redundant while on or shortly after returning from maternity leave. ""The last thing they want to do at this time in their lives is engage in a legal battle and in many cases, they simply can't afford to,"" she added. Angela Rayner, shadow minister for women and equalities, said the report shows thousands of pregnant women are being ""priced out of justice"" because of tribunal fees introduced by the government. Former Liberal Democrat equalities minister Jo Swinson, now chairwoman of the charity Maternity Action, said too often companies were using pregnancy as an ""excuse to get rid of someone"". Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said it was a ""confusing landscape"" that meant ""some bad bosses"" were ""getting away with treating their employees unfairly"". Last week, a study for the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that the earning power between men and those women returning to work after having a child becomes steadily wider. Over the subsequent 12 years, women's hourly pay rate falls 33% behind men's.","""Urgent action"" is needed to give pregnant women and new mothers more protection at work after a ""shocking"" increase in discrimination, MPs say."
"By Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, BBC News The cost of the two new Queen Elizabeth class carriers - originally ordered under the last Labour government - has already risen dramatically from £3.5bn to around £7bn. Changes ordered by the coalition government could see those costs rise even further. The current confusion is over which planes should fly off the new carrier. Labour had originally proposed to buy a vertical landing variant of the new Joint Strike Fighter plane, also know as the F-35, which would be launched from a ""ski jump"" fitted on the new carriers and then land vertically. The system is similar to that used by the Harrier jump jet on HMS Ark Royal - both of which were scrapped following the strategic defence and security review. Cameron's criticism However, as a result of that review, the current government said it would change its F-35 order to the carrier variant. It would though require significant modifications to the design of the aircraft carriers. This would require the ships to be fitted with catapults and arrestor gear - or ""cats and traps"" - to launch and recover the planes. At the time of the change, Prime Minister David Cameron said that the last government got it ""badly wrong"" on the decisions made for the new carrier. Speaking in the Commons on 19 October 2010, Mr Cameron said Britain would now fit ""cats and traps"" to just one of the carriers. He said: ""This will allow our allies to operate from our operational carrier and it will allow us to buy the carrier version of the [F-35] Joint Strike Fighter which is more capable, less expensive, has a longer range and can carry more weapons."" Since then there have been a number of issues likely to have forced the rethink. The costs of fitting ""cats and traps"" are believed to have risen significantly. Further testing The plan was to use the latest electro-magnetic technology to launch the planes, rather than the traditional steam catapult. But the new technology is untried and untested on board a ship. It is due to be fitted to the next generation of US carriers, but alreadythe US Congress has voiced concerns about the programme.. The former Defence Secretary, Liam Fox, initially estimated it would cost in the region of £700m to fit the new cats and traps. The BBC understands that figure has risen to well over £1bn. There have also been concerns over the carrier variant of the F-35. US Department of Defence documents leaked earlier this year found that a design flaw in the fighter resulted in repeated failures during simulated landings. Problems with the tail hook on the jet meant it failed to catch the arrestor cable on the carrier's deck to bring it to a halt. As a result the US has postponed its order to allow more time for testing. Clarity call The UK government says it will make a final decision on which plane to buy around Easter. But in a statement the Ministry of Defence confirmed that it's now ""reviewing all programmes, including elements of the carrier strike programme, to validate costs and ensure risks are properly managed"". That review is likely to have a major impact on BAE Systems, which is the main contractor on the construction of the two new carriers, and also a partner in the development of the Joint Strike Fighter. Though the US defence firm Lockheed Martin is the main contractor, BAE is building the tail section of all three variants of the F-35, accounting for about 10% of the work. At Warton in Lancashire, BAE test pilots and engineers have already begun work on the new design. They are using a sophisticated simulator that will help train pilots and allow engineers to tweak the design of the carrier. Another change of mind will mean wasted time, money and effort. Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy says ""the country deserves urgent clarity from the government"" on this issue. ""We need to know how carrier strike capability will be delivered, with detail costs, timescales and interoperability with allies"". The decision to sell the Harriers to the US now appeared ""increasingly reckless"", he said. Order cut The uncertainty cannot be entirely blamed on the government. It is not alone in facing difficult choices about the new F-35 plane. With defence budgets shrinking around the globe, the aircraft's rising costs and technical issues still to overcome, a number of nations are reviewing their original orders for the aircraft. The UK itself had originally planned to buy around 160 of the jets for the Royal Navy and RAF. That number has since been cut to just over 130 and could fall even further. This government has described the state of the defence budget left by the last Labour government as a ""car crash"". Ministers have promised to rein in spending and clamp down on the huge overspends that have plagued the MoD in the past. They appear to have made some progress. But the carrier programme is still a cause for concern.","The Ministry of Defence has confirmed it is reviewing parts of the programme to build two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy, throwing doubt over the planned use of the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter plane. This decision could have a major impact on BAE Systems, which is involved in the aircraft's development."
"The Fenland buildings are dated to 1,000-800BC, towards the end of Britain's Bronze Age. If we were to go back to that time, what other buildings could we have seen? By 1,000-800BC Egypt's New Kingdom, which produced such magnificent monuments as the temples of Karnak and Abu Simbel, was already over. The Giza pyramids were over 1,000 years old. The pharaoh Sheshonq of the 22nd dynasty added some embellishments to the Karnak complex at the time of the Must Farm buildings. As Raiders of the Lost Ark viewers will remember, he is also said to have looted the treasures from Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem - which would no doubt have been an impressive building too. Wear and tear have been less kind to the brick monuments of Mesopotamia and other parts of the Near East than to the stones of Egypt. But outstanding monuments would have included the lofty ziggurats ascending to the sky, like that of Ur, constructed in the early Bronze Age and rebuilt many times. Travellers to Greece would have been able to see the sizeable buildings erected by the Mycenaean civilisation - which had collapsed some 200 years before, although no-one is sure why. The best-preserved of these are the great ""beehive tombs"" of Mycenae, particularly the so-called ""Treasury of Atreus"". And in Britain, as in many parts of Europe, the monuments of the Neolithic period which preceded the Bronze Age would still have been prominent, as indeed Stonehenge still is today. The stones were set up in the form in which we know them before 2,000BC.","The Bronze Age houses recovered from river silt in Cambridgeshire have been hailed as ""an extraordinary time capsule"" and even ""Britain's Pompeii""."
"Jack Gilbert, 23, Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, 19, and Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, were found dead on tracks near Loughborough Junction station on Monday. Mr Carrasco's family said they were ""painting graffiti late at night in a particularly dangerous place"". Mr Scott-Hood's parents said he was a ""beautiful artist"" and ""kind man"". Mr Gilbert's family said the only solace they could find in his death was that ""he died doing something he loved"". Railway graffiti: Props, respect and death British Transport Police (BTP) said it is believed they were hit by an out-of-service passenger train shortly after 01:00 BST on Monday. The train was forensically examined on Tuesday. Susie and Perry Scott-Hood said their son, from Muswell Hill, was ""loved by everyone"". ""He was an intelligent and wonderful boy who had so many close friends,"" they said. ""Many people will know Harrison loved to travel, he was a beautiful artist and spent time recently travelling around Vietnam and Cambodia. ""Harrison completed us. He is irreplaceable."" 'Rest In Paint' Spanish-American national Mr Carrasco, from Hampstead, was due to start a course in graphic design in September, his family said. A statement read: ""His absence has left a deep hole in the family. ""We believe the three were hit by a train when they were painting graffiti late at night in a particularly dangerous place."" Meanwhile family said Mr Gilbert from Enfield, north London, had ""endless"" generosity and ""lit up everyone's world just by being in it"". In a statement they added: ""There are no words to describe the devastation we feel. He was a wonderful son, brother, uncle and boyfriend. ""His talent for art even from an early age was exceptional,"" they added. ""Everyone loved Jack and the only solace we have is he died doing something he loved."" At the scene, flowers and spray cans lie next to shutters spray-painted with ""RIP"" and love hearts. Messages were left to the trio under the ""tags"" of Kbag, Lover and Trip on social media. Many read ""Rest In Paint"", alongside images of painted tags on trains and walls. Det Supt Gary Richardson from BTP said: ""We have a dedicated team working to establish how these young men came to be on the tracks. ""The initial evidence we have been able to gather indicates that the men may have been on the track for the purposes of spraying graffiti."" The force warned of the ""massive risk"" graffiti artists make by trespassing on train tracks. At the scene: Aurelia Allen, BBC London By lunchtime today, a modest tribute had been left outside Loughborough Junction station - three bunches of flowers, three spray cans, and three letters sprayed in black - RIP. Otherwise, there was little sign of the young lives lost just a short way along the track. I watched three teenage boys quietly add to the floral tributes, but it was the later arrival of a group of about 20 youngsters which marked a distinct change in the atmosphere. At least two of them took out spray cans and begun daubing the station walls with 'RIP' and the nicknames of the young victims - undeterred by the presence of journalists or station staff. They seemed angry and many were in tears. One boy, Sam, told me he was best friends with Alberto Fresneda Carrasco. He said 'Alby' had died doing what he loved. A girl, who was visibly upset, described them as 'just kids'. The graffiti they left amounts to criminal damage, but it doesn't look out of place. Almost every section of elevated railway infrastructure in sight had been sprayed - places I can't imagine anyone could reach safely. The manager of a nearby garage told me graffiti was a problem in the area. Another local businessman said he'd seen youngsters climb up onto railway bridges at night. Officers were called to the scene at about 07:30 on Monday and the three were pronounced dead. It is understood spray cans were found near the bodies. A tweet by former Transport for London (TfL) board member Brian Cooke described the dead men as ""common scum who cost the railway millions and keep fares high"". His account has since become private but was captured and shared by graffiti magazine Frontline. One Instagram user described the comments as ""insensitive and ignorant"", while another said he had gone ""too far"". A Twitter user wrote: ""Think before you vocalise such brutal opinions."" Mr Cooke was a TfL board member between 2012 and 2016. He was removed as chairman of London TravelWatch after breaching the terms of his appointment by declaring his support for Boris Johnson days before the 2008 mayoral election.",Tributes have been paid to three men killed by a train near a south London station.
"Chris Smart said James Cole, who was number two on UKIP's Wales list at the 2014 European election and has rejoined the party, is ready to take over. But Mr Gill said it would be ""perverse"" because Mr Cole stood for another party in May's assembly poll. Mr Cole said he had made no moves to pursue the job but would serve as MEP if it was in the party's interests. Mr Gill has been criticised for ""double jobbing"" - he previously promised to give up the MEP role if he was elected to the assembly. But after becoming an AM he said there was no-one to succeed him as UKIP's Wales Euro-MP so he would continue doing both jobs, avoiding a European by-election. If Mr Gill stepped down, the job would pass to Mr Cole, as he was the candidate listed second by the party at the 2014 European election. He was previously ineligible to take over as he had left UKIP. Numbers three and four on the 2014 list, Caroline Jones and Dave Rowlands, are now also AMs. Mr Cole stood for the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party at May's assembly election but then rejoined UKIP. Mr Smart told BBC Wales: ""Nathan Gill should step down as a successor is now available. Doing two jobs is not practical. ""We need all seven AMs to be effective and he can't be effective doing two jobs. ""The perception with the public is not good either. James is ready and able to do the job."" 'Proxy war' But Mr Gill said it was ""highly unlikely"" that Mr Cole would be ""deemed eligible"" to take over as an MEP. ""Mr Cole left the party in animosity and was publicly critical of its leadership before setting up his own party, which directly competed with UKIP in the Welsh Assembly elections, potentially costing UKIP three seats,"" Mr Gill said. ""It would be a perverse choice and it would be highly unlikely that anyone would deem him eligible to become UKIP's MEP for Wales."" Mr Cole said on Facebook that the job was not a ""matter for me or anyone"" but was up to UKIP's National Executive Committee. He said he had been a ""member for months"" and had made ""no moves towards this"". ""I would take the job if in the interest of the party as a whole but Nathan has said that he can complete two jobs and is not planning to resign,"" he said. On Sunday, Mr Gill said those within UKIP calling for him to stand down were doing so out of ""malice"". It followed the leaking of a letter to BBC Wales in which UKIP chairman Steve Crowther demanded that Mr Gill should honour his commitment to stand down. Mr Gill described the situation as ""a proxy war"" between the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) and loyalists of former leader Nigel Farage and said his take-home pay was now lower.

"The British musician, who spent 18 years with the band from 1979, also played with Argent and The Zombies. His cousin and fellow bandmate, Rod Argent, paid tribute on Facebook to the ""magnificent bass player"", who died following a fall on the stairs. He also highlighted his commitment to the music scene in St Albans where he had lived all his life, playing with family members in The Rodford Files. ""He gave us absolutely unflagging commitment, loyalty and unbelievable energy... Our gratitude is beyond measure,"" Argent said. ""To the end, Jim's life was dedicated to music,"" Argent continued, in a lengthy tribute posted on Saturday. ""He will be unbelievably missed."" The Kinks' Dave Davies paid tribute to his former colleague, who played with the band between 1979 and 1993, writing that he was ""devastated by Jim's sudden loss"". ""I'm too broken up to put words together, it's such a shock, I always thought Jim would live forever in true rock and roll fashion - strange - great friend, great musician, great man - he was an integral part of the Kinks later years. RIP,"" he wrote on Twitter. Rodford was playing with The Bluetones when his cousin, Argent, first asked him to join his then-band The Zombies, alongside singer Colin Blunstone. Rodford declined, but Argent in his Facebook tribute said he was ""inextricably bound to the story of The Zombies"" and credited him as being ""an enormous enabler"" for the band who went on to have a major US hit with She's Not There in 1964. After a stint with the Mike Cotton Sound, the bassist did eventually agree to join his cousin as a founding member of Argent, who are best remembered for the songs Hold Your Head Up and God Gave Rock and Roll to You. When the Argent split in 1976, Rodford was recruited by the Kinks after the departure of John Dalton, performing on every album from 1979's Low Budget to 1993's Phobia. ""It is with deep sadness that we have learned that Jim Rodford passed away - he toured and recorded with the Kinks for many years and will be greatly missed. He was much loved by all of us,"" said an official statement from the Kinks on Twitter. Rodford joined the revived Zombies in 1999 alongside his son, drummer Steve Rodford, touring until his death, most recently in Florida this month.

"Mr Dunn, 19, died in a crash in Northamptonshire in August that led to the suspect leaving the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. His family had hoped to put pressure on Mr Raab at the event in Surrey. Mr Raab said he felt a ""constructive conversation"" would not have been possible due to crowds there. A member of staff at the church where the hustings were held said they were kept outside due to fire safety. Mr Dunn's parents have begun legal action against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), alleging the granting of immunity by Mr Raab was ""wrong in law"". But the FCO has said it will ""seek costs"" for any judicial review brought and argue the family has not found ""any reasonably arguable ground of legal challenge"". It said an allegation that the foreign secretary had ""misused and/or abused his power"" was ""entirely without foundation"". Signs calling for Harry's family and friends to be allowed to enter were held up against the East Molesey Methodist Church door, which was monitored by staff. There were chants of ""let us in"" from more than 50 people who were left outside on Monday night. As Mr Raab left the church in an official car, a crowd booed and branded him a ""coward"". Mr Raab told the BBC: ""I'm happy to see the family whenever they want to, but doing it outside in those circumstances… I don't think was the right thing to do, it's not like we'd be able to have a constructive conversation."" He reiterated his sympathy for the Dunn family and said he would ""like to see justice done"" but that he had ""no control over the case"". Harry's father Tim Dunn said he had hoped to call on voters to back another candidate to unseat Mr Raab at the Esher and Walton constituency hustings. Asked why he thought the foreign secretary did not speak to him, Mr Dunn said: ""I think he doesn't want to give me the answers I need. ""There's things going on, we're not quiet about it, we think the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) and the FCO are talking and delaying tactics."" Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity but the family are seeking a judicial review of that decision. During the hustings, Rebecca Little, who lives in Cobham, said she asked about Mr Dunn's case on behalf of his family. ""There were several security detail preventing the family from coming in but they have a right to enter the hustings,"" she said.","Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was called a ""coward"" by the friends and family of Harry Dunn as they were left outside constituency hustings."

"What is the West Bank? It is a chunk of land located - as the name suggests - on the west bank of the River Jordan and bounded by Israel to the north, west and south. To its east lies Jordan.Explainer: Israel, annexation and the West Bank The West Bank has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war, but decades of difficult on-off talks between Israel and the Palestinians - both of whom assert rights there - have left its final status unresolved. Between 2.1 million and 3 million (sources vary) Palestinian Arabs live in the West Bank under both limited self-rule and Israeli military rule. The West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) is also home to some 430,000 Israeli Jews who live in 132 settlements (and 124 smaller ""outposts"") built under Israel's occupation. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US under the Trump administration dispute this interpretation. What is ""annexation"" and why does it matter here? Annexation is the term applied when a state unilaterally proclaims its sovereignty over other territory. It is forbidden by international law. A recent example was Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Mr Netanyahu has said the plan is ""not annexation"", although it involves applying Israeli sovereignty to the parts of the West Bank which contain Jewish settlements, as well as most of a swathe of land along the West Bank's boundary with Jordan, known as the Jordan Valley. The move could result in some 4.5% of Palestinians in the West Bank living in enclaves within annexed territory. Mr Netanyahu has said Israeli sovereignty will not be applied to Palestinians in the Jordan Valley, and reports say the same exclusion will extend to Palestinians in other annexed parts of the West Bank. The areas earmarked for annexation (the precise contours of which are being mapped by Israel and the US) may comprise about 30% of the West Bank, according to reports. Mr Netanyahu may initially act to annex just the settlements, which could amount to only 3% of the West Bank. The remaining 27% may have to wait until the boundaries are agreed with Washington. However, the Palestinians seek the whole of the West Bank - to which they claim an historical right - for a future independent state, along with the Gaza Strip. Any annexation by Israel, they argue, would leave Palestinian areas fragmented and the Palestinian people with considerably less land for a country of their own. If it's so controversial, why does Israel want to do it? Israel claims historical and religious rights to the West Bank as the ancestral land of the Jewish people. It also says its presence there - especially in the Jordan Valley - is strategically vital for its self-defence. It says settlements are not an obstacle to peace and that they would remain part of Israel under any peace deal with the Palestinians, whether they are annexed now or not. Mr Netanyahu has long championed the settlements and through annexation wants to remove any doubt as to their fate, something which strongly appeals to his political base. Why is this being talked about now? Until recently, Mr Netanyahu would have faced solid opposition among the international community to such a move. However, Donald Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, unveiled in January, allows for Israel to ""incorporate"" all the settlements - something no previous US administration had countenanced. It is possible that Mr Netanyahu wants to get it done before the US presidential election in November in case Mr Trump's rival Joe Biden - who opposes annexation - is elected and reverses US policy. An agreement which returned Mr Netanyahu to office as head of a national unity government in May set 1 July as the date from which the annexation process could be initiated. What would change with annexation? Assuming it happens (Israel and the US are still deliberating exactly when and how), the settlements and surrounding areas will become permanent parts of Israel (at least, from Israel's position). Reversal would require the support of a large majority of Israeli MPs, something which is very unlikely. In practice, Israeli laws already apply to settlers, though not to Palestinians, who are subject only to Israeli military orders and Palestinian laws, so there would be little noticeable change in that respect. One of the most significant differences annexation would likely make is in settlement construction - long one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. Currently, building and zoning in the West Bank requires the approval of Israel's defence minister and prime minister, and can take months or years. Following annexation, it would become a local matter and consequently easier for Israel to build there. Beyond the annexed areas, the Israeli military will continue to exercise overall authority - something Palestinians say has deprived generations of their basic civil rights. What is the global response to Israel's plan? By and large, Israel has been warned by friend and foe alike not to go ahead with annexation. There are fears that such a move will put peace between Israel and the Palestinians even further out of reach. The Palestinians are calling for international pressure to thwart Mr Netanyahu's plans, and their prime minister has said they could declare their own independent state on almost all of the West Bank if Israel annexes land there. The UN's Middle East envoy has warned that Israeli annexation and Palestinian counter-steps ""would dramatically shift local dynamics and most likely trigger conflict and instability in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip"". However, the US is likely to block any attempts to pass resolutions at the UN Security Council condemning Israel. Jordan, one of only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel, has said it would be forced to review its relations with Israel if annexation goes ahead. But while the Arab world has sharply criticised Israel's plans, declarations of solidarity with the Palestinians may be as far as Arab states - especially those in the Gulf that have unofficial relations with Israel - will go. The EU - Israel's biggest trading partner - says it will use diplomatic means to ""discourage"" Israel from carrying out its plans. Although some member states have called for tougher action, including possible sanctions, there appears little support for such a move at the moment.",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is planning to effectively annex parts of the occupied West Bank in what would be a major - and highly controversial - act.

"By Tom de Castella and Caroline McClatcheyBBC News Magazine Today all politicians want to cut unemployment from its present high levels. But once upon a time the goal was full employment - a common political slogan in post-war Britain as society attempted to put behind it the horrors of the Great Depression. Former US president Bill Clinton subscribed to a modern form of it when he said: ""I do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until people who are willing to work have work."" But the very idea that the government should be able to create an economy in which everyone is able to get a job might already sound dated to some. This week the UK's unemployment figure rose to 2.57 million, a rate of 8.1%. It is lower than the US (9.1%), Greece (16.7%) and Spain (21.2%). But it is the highest it has been in the UK since 1994, with more than a fifth of those aged 16-24 without a job. But has there ever been full employment? That depends, like a lot of economics, on one's definition of the term. ""Full employment never meant zero unemployment,"" says Christopher Pissarides, professor of economics at the London School of Economics. Instead there is what the free market economist Milton Friedman termed a ""natural rate"" of unemployment, where nobody stays out of work for long, unemployment fluctuates between 5% and 6% with jobless workers quickly being hired in growth sectors of the economy. Other economists argue this is too high. William Beveridge, the man who inspired Britain's post-war welfare state, said full employment meant a figure of under 3%. Before the world became industrialised, nearly everyone outside the rich elite would have had to work to survive, usually in the fields. After industrialisation all that changed. Mechanisation offered people work in the factories but also brought huge spikes in employment and an intensification of economic boom and bust. Pissarides argues that full employment was a reality in the US in the 1990s under Bill Clinton and from 1997-2007 in Britain, and in modern day China. Other economists say it's not fair to compare democracies with autocratic societies. Children learn in history lessons about the mass mobilisation of men in Hitler's Germany for armaments production and public works programmes. ""Conscripting people over the barrel of the gun in totalitarian societies is not full employment as economists understand the term,"" says economic historian Tim Leunig. So has genuine full employment ever been achieved in the post industrial world? ""Of course we've had it,"" says the economist Lord Skidelsky. ""Between 1950 and 1973 unemployment averaged 2% and was always well under one million."" This was the golden age for jobs in Britain. The high point came in July 1955 - shortly after Anthony Eden had taken over from Winston Churchill as prime minister - when unemployment reached a post-war low of 215,800, a mere 1%. So what happened to full employment? Ian Brinkley, director of think tank the Work Foundation, says the term went out of fashion in the 1970s as unemployment passed one million. Then in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher pursued a different approach, which economists characterised as the prioritising of tackling inflation. The concept of full employment was dead, says Brinkley. Unemployment climbed above the symbolically important three million figure, and stayed relatively high despite economic recovery. It was the election of Tony Blair in 1997 that saw renewed talk of full employment. ""New Labour came in and adopted a modern version of full employment,"" Brinkley says. Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown no longer sought a low percentage of unemployment. Instead they changed the definition to boosting the total number of jobs. Writing in his autobiography, A Journey, Blair claimed that by the time he stepped down there were ""over 2.5m more in work"". It was a cunning shifting of the goal posts, Brinkley says. With a rising population the party was almost guaranteed to boost the number of jobs in the economy. Neither did it have to say who was getting the jobs. Campaign groups like Migration Watch argue that the majority of jobs created by Labour went to foreign workers, leaving the proportion of unemployed Britons little changed. And then there was the issue of misleading figures. In 1998 the total on incapacity benefit was ""1.7m and rising"", Blair writes in his memoirs. The unemployment statistics ""masked the huge rise in numbers on incapacity benefit that had taken place under the Tories and was continuing under us"" he conceded. Now unemployment is rising again there may be some politicians who under their breath admit it is no bad thing. In 1992, Conservative Chancellor Norman Lamont said: ""Rising unemployment and the recession have been the price we have had to pay to get inflation down. That is a price well worth paying."" Some argue that it was the policy of the Thatcher government in the 1980s to use rising unemployment as a brake on inflation. The theory is that as people lose their jobs, the pressure for wage rises diminishes. But Conservative MP John Redwood, chairman of the party's policy review group on economic competitiveness, disputes that this was Thatcher's aim. She was pursuing a ""sensible"" approach to control inflation so that the economy could recover and unemployment would fall in the longer term, he argues. Pissarides says the problem with Thatcher was that rising unemployment was not a temporary situation but continued for many years. But he agrees with the theory that some unemployment is better for an economy than none. ""It is better to have 1% or 2% unemployment than zero because the smaller rates will give rise to labour shortages and cause inflation."" Others disagree. The late James Tobin, whose theories are said to be guiding President Obama's stimulus programme, believed that there was no such thing as an optimum level of unemployment. ""I did a paper where I analysed the optimal unemployment rate,"" the economist Joseph Stiglitz was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg article. ""Tobin went livid over the idea. To him the optimal unemployment rate was zero."" Redwood agrees with Tobin's idea that full employment means getting everyone a job. ""I'm not sure it's gone out of fashion. All three political parties have a high level aim of full employment."" The problem is not the desire to bring in full employment but delivering it. Labour stopped talking about it because they had difficulty in achieving it, Redwood argues. And David Cameron's government faces both the financial crisis and an ""enormous economic challenge from the East"". Redwood is pessimistic about whether it can be delivered in the near future. ""Recently it's proved beyond the ability of most Western governments."" The historian David Kynaston says the issue is as much psychological as economic. He argues that there was a ""psychic shift"" towards accepting unemployment in the 1980s. Up to the election of Margaret Thatcher, it was believed that any government that created mass unemployment would fall at the next election. Yet in 1983, despite taking unemployment to over three million, the Conservatives won with an increased majority. The view of unemployment had changed forever. ""As long as most people were in work it didn't matter if rather a lot of other people, albeit a minority, were not. So unemployment lost its profile as an issue."" And with unemployment once again nearing the three million mark, Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne will be focused on turning the tide of people losing their jobs. To talk of full employment in this climate might be seen as having just a whiff of hubris about it.",Full employment used to be a much-cherished political mantra. Why does it seem to have disappeared from public debate?
"By Geoff WhiteBBC Click At least three chances to assess how well the systems deal with ethnicity were missed over the past five years, the BBC found. Campaigners said the tech had too many problems to be used widely. ""It must be dropped immediately,"" said privacy rights group Big Brother Watch. Lost lesson Several UK police forces have been trialling controversial new facial recognition technology, including automated systems which attempt to identify the faces of people in real time as they pass a camera. Documents from the police, Home Office and university researchers show that police are aware that ethnicity can have an impact on such systems, but have failed on several occasions to test this. The Home Office said facial recognition can be an ""invaluable tool"" in fighting crime. ""The technology continues to evolve, and the Home Office continues to keep its effectiveness under constant review,"" a spokesman told the BBC. The ability of facial recognition software to cope with black and ethnic minority faces has proved a key concern for those worried about the technology, who claim the software is often trained on predominantly white faces. Minutes from a police working group reveal that the UK police's former head of facial recognition knew that skin colour was an issue. At an April 2014 meeting, Durham Police Chief Constable Mike Barton noted ""that ethnicity can have an impact on search accuracy"". He asked CGI, the Canadian company managing the police's facial image database, to investigate the issue, but subsequent minutes from the working group do not mention a follow-up. Facial recognition was introduced on the Police National Database (PND), which includes around 13 million faces, in 2014. The database has troubled privacy groups because it contains images of people subsequently cleared of any offence. A 2012 court decision ruled that holding such images was unlawful. The ""unlawful"" images are still held on the PND. The government is currently investigating ways to purge them from the system. Despite this, the PND facial recognition system, provided by German company Cognitec, has proved very popular. The number of face match searches done on the PND grew from 3,360 in 2014 to 12,504 in 2017, Freedom of Information requests to the Home Office have revealed. In 2015, a team of assessors from the Home Office tested the PND facial search system, using about 200 sample images. They had identified ethnicity information about the sample photos but, once again, failed to use this opportunity to check how well the system worked with different skin colours. The same Home Office report also estimated that, across the entire PND, about 40% of the images were duplicated. It noted that this meant the UK government has overpaid hundreds of thousands of pounds to Cognitec, because the company charges more once the number of images (or ""templates"") on the database exceeds 10 million. The Home Office assessment also found the facial recognition system was only half as good as the human eye. It said: ""Out of the initial 211 searches, the automated facial search of PND identified just 20 true matches, whereas visual examination by the tester identified a total of 56 matches."" Cognitec declined to comment on costs, but said its matching technology had improved since the Home Office report, and that facial recognition results always required review by a human. A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said the technology had the potential to disrupt criminals, but said any roll-out must show its effectiveness within ""sufficient safeguards"". It added that work is being done to improve the system's accuracy and remove duplicates. Another chance to check for racial bias was missed last year during trials by South Wales of real-time facial recognition software, which was used at sports events and concerts. Cardiff University carried out an assessment of the force's use of the technology, That study stated that ""due to limited funds for this trial"", ethnicity was not tested. Cardiff's report noted, however, that ""during the evaluation period, no overt racial discrimination effects were observed"", but said this may be due to the demographic make-up of the watch lists used by the force. In addition, an interim report by a biometrics advisory group to the government considering ethical issues of facial recognition highlighted concerns about the lack of ethnic diversity in datasets. Under-representation of certain types of faces, particularly those from ethnic minorities, could mean bias ""feeds forward"" into the use of the technology, it said. Silkie Carlo, director of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ""The police's failure to do basic accuracy testing for race speaks volumes. ""Their wilful blindness to the risk of racism, and the risk to Brits' rights as a whole, reflects the dangerously irresponsible way in which facial recognition has crept on to our streets."" The technology had too many problems to justify its used, she said. ""It must be dropped immediately,"" Ms Carlo added. Big Brother Watch is currently taking legal action against the Metropolitan Police over its use of automated facial recognition systems.","Black and minority ethnic people could be falsely identified and face questioning because police have failed to test how well their systems deal with non-white faces, say campaigners."
"Gavin HewittEurope editor@BBCGavinHewitton Twitter One fact stood out above all others from a chaotic and confusing night: Greece, in the short term, would not be leaving the euro with all the chaos that would flow from it. Central bankers and European finance ministers, who had been on standby, could relax just a little. Like so much in the eurozone, a step is taken that buys time but little more. The winner was Antonis Samaras, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party. He defined the election as a choice between staying in the euro or returning to the drachma. Despite that stark choice only 40% of voters backed parties that supported the bailout deal with the EU and the IMF. The message from Greece was once more that they wanted to stay in the euro but not at the price of the austerity measures they were enduring. The outcome does not offer stability to Greece. Waiting in the wings will be a new powerful opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras. This leftist radical got 27% of the vote by promising to tear up the bailout agreement, even whilst insisting he wanted to stay in the euro. Shortly after the results Mr Samaras said he wanted to build a government of national unity. But Alexis Tsipras wanted nothing to do with it. His calculation is that this new coalition government will last just a few months. Last night he told his supporters: ""very soon the left will be in power"". And, for good measure, he repeated a message that found such resonance with the voters: ""overthrowing the bailout was the only solution"". He sounds like a politician not unhappy to be on the sidelines for a short period. More hard bargaining Mr Samaras's first priority will be to form a convincing coalition. He will get the support of Pasok, the Greek socialists. That coalition, in itself, brings with it problems. They are the two parties that have governed Greece for the past 30 years and are blamed for many of the country's problems. Once he has formed a government his immediate challenge is the bailout agreement. Although he accepted the basic terms of the deal he insisted during the campaign that he wanted concessions. It should be remembered that when Pasok was in power he opposed many of the austerity measures, saying that what Greece needed was growth. If he is confirmed in power he will have a stronger opposition breathing down his neck. He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult. Already the German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform (bailout) programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth. But the message is clear - the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay. The German finance minister underlined that message when he said ""Greece's path will be neither short nor easy"". And therein lies the instability. The Greek economy is in freefall. The country is in the fifth year of recession. Unemployment is at 22%. Real wages - for many people - are down by 25%. The streets bear the scars of social breakdown. The country does not have much time. What happens in Greece will be influenced by the outcome of the current tension between France and Germany. Hollande growth agenda The French President, Francois Hollande, will be emboldened by his victory in the French parliamentary elections. His Socialist party controls the Elysee Palace and parliament. The French view is that ""Europeans need to help Greeks return to growth"". Mr Hollande will push hard for his growth first agenda. He wants more flexibility on meeting deficit targets. He wants a European banking union that contains a joint deposit guarantee scheme. He is pushing a 120bn-euro (£97bn; $152bn) growth covenant for Europe. Chancellor Merkel is cautious as usual. In recent days there have been several warnings from Berlin that Germany cannot take on all of Europe's debts. And then it should not be forgotten - Greece had the ability to spark a severe crisis. But the future of the eurozone will be determined by what happens in Italy and Spain. And here two fundamental questions remain unanswered. If those economies get into difficulty what will stand behind them, how will they be supported? And - perhaps most importantly - where will growth come from to relieve two countries mired in recession? Without those answers the can is still just being kicked down the road.",You could almost hear the sighs of relief coming out of Brussels and Berlin when the results from the Greek election were finally established.
"The Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic at the University of Edinburgh was opened by Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal. The centre will look at finding treatments to slow progression of neurodegenerative diseases. It was established with a donation from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. It is named after the author's mother, who had the disease and died aged 45. The centre will look at conditions such as multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as autism and early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The Princess Royal, who is Chancellor of Edinburgh University, was given a tour of the clinic and staff and students demonstrated the facilities and described current research projects. 'Proud' Ms Rowling, who donated £10m, said: ""I am moved and elated to see the Anne Rowling Clinic formally opened today by HRH The Princess Royal. ""Having observed the plans for the clinic develop and expand to fulfil the needs of patients, clinicians and researchers, I am now very proud to see the building finished and operating as the beating heart of this centre for excellence. ""Thank you to everyone who has been involved in its creation and operation."" Prof Siddharthan Chandran, professor of neurology and co-director of the clinic, said: ""We are delighted to officially open this clinic. ""All patients with these tough diseases need treatments that will slow, stop and ideally reverse damage. ""The Anne Rowling Clinic will pioneer discovery science and innovative clinical research through strong partnerships with the NHS, academia and industry around the world. ""Only by better understanding the biological processes behind these devastating diseases can we identify new targets for potential therapies and take them into clinical trials.""

"By Daniel Kraemer BBC Westminster What have MPs done in the last year? Since Parliament opened last June, the government has introduced 39 bills. Twenty-six of them became law in the 177 House of Commons sitting days before parliamentarians went on their summer break last week. Is this particularly slow progress? These numbers are not significantly lower than other recent years. Given that Theresa May's party does not have a majority in the House of Commons, you might expect the passage of new laws to be sluggish. For example, there were 142 sitting days in the 2016/17 session, during which MPs passed 25 government bills. The difference this year has been the influx of Brexit-related legislation taking up MPs' time. Has Brexit pushed other laws out? Five of this year's 26 new laws were presented by the government as being crucial for Brexit preparation, compared with just one the previous year, with another two currently making their way through Parliament. According to our calculations, MPs have spent approximately 155 hours debating Brexit bills. The Institute for Government says 112 hours were spent on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. We are only halfway through an unusual two-year session of Parliament so the government still has time to pass more of the non-Brexit bills set out in the Queen's Speech last year. But there are still at least three major Brexit bills to come - on agriculture, fisheries and migration - not to mention the approval and implementation of the final withdrawal agreement. What other laws have made it through? On top of the five Brexit bills, five of the new laws this year were related to keeping the Northern Ireland government going while Stormont remains in deadlock. Another five were technical laws relating to budgets and allocation of money. This leaves 11 substantial non-Brexit bills. Here are some of the more noteworthy ones... Space Industry Act One of the more exciting things to come out of Parliament this year (it's a low bar), the government celebrated this new law as the ""most modern piece of space industry legislation anywhere in the world"" as it received Royal Assent in March. The aim is to open the space industry to businesses by enabling them to launch satellites and experiments from the UK, where a large chunk of the hardware is already built and a lot of the expertise comes from. Government minister Jo Johnson wants to increase the UK's share of the global space market from 6.5% to 10% in the next 12 years. The law - supported across the political spectrum - paved the way for the government's announcement in July that Sutherland on the northern tip of Scotland would be the site of the UK's first spaceport. Secure Tenancies (Victims of Domestic Abuse) Bill During debates over the controversial Housing and Planning Act in 2016, campaigners and politicians pointed out that reduced security of tenancy agreements could affect those fleeing domestic abuse. They argued that the 2016 law decreased security of tenancies in social housing and that this could put victims of abuse in danger by making them less likely to flee the house of their abuser. The main effect of the Act is to ensure that victims fleeing their abusers retain a right to 'lifetime' secure tenancies when fixed-term tenancies become mandatory for English housing authorities. As the bill was introduced in December, Labour peer Baroness Lister - who campaigned for the change - said ""women fleeing domestic violence will receive an unexpected Christmas gift"". Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Act Under current laws, people caught targeting pilots with laser pens could be fine up to £2,500. But this bill allows for sentences up to five years and unlimited fines. It also expands those protected by the law to include bus drivers, captains of boats and - most crucially - hovercraft pilots. A total of 1,258 laser attack incidents were reported in 2016, most commonly targeting pilots flying in to London's Heathrow airport. There were no votes in either Houses of Parliament and the bill became law in May. The law came into effect two weeks ago. Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Act 2018 This two-page law, passed in February, aims to bring flexibility to life in the armed forces. It makes it easier for personnel to serve part time or restrict the amount of time they are separated from their normal base. The Ministry of Defence said this amendment to the 2006 Armed Forces Act is an attempt to widen appeal of working in the armed forces by making it more family-friendly and increasing retention of members.","It would be easy to forget that MPs have more to do than trying to sort out Brexit. It has dominated politics, but has it stopped Parliamentary business-as-usual?"

"When I was growing up, one of the subjects I learnt in both primary and secondary school was history - not only of Nigeria but also of Europe. The bare facts of the growth of nationalities might not have been interesting to my young mind but I grew up with the conviction that hardly anything could be more exciting than the study of the exploits of men and women who later became heroes - or villains - among their people as they shaped the course of history either in their local areas or in the world at large. A long ago, I read in history books of the conquest of the Ilorin people in the central Kwara State, by Fulani forces from Sokoto under Shehu Alimi following the betrayal of the Alafin of Oyo by his former warlord, Afonja. So now I understand clearly the never-ending undercurrent of ethnic restiveness between the Yoruba and the Fulani peoples in the Kwara state capital. Many other ethnic crises across the Nigerian nation are similarly rooted in historical events and they may be resolved only after excavating the root, but who has the tools? Conquered chauvinism Queen Amina of Zaria in the north, Moremi of Ife and Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti of Abeokuta in the west were historical figures whose lives I studied in school. They were women who conquered the chauvinism of their times to lead their communities in war and in political emancipation. Their history is a study in equality of the sexes, each given the same opportunities. A government has to be retrogressive to discourage the studying of the lives of these great human beings by removing history as a subject from our school curricula. Sola Odunfa: ""A person who does not know the history of his own family compound surely cannot seek to settle scores among other families in the clan"" It was during the military rule of General Ibrahim Babangida in the 1980s and early 1990s that the studying of history began to disappear from our schools and, in recent years, it has not been taught at all. The reason given then was that history did not add to the market value of students after graduation. Experience showed that the only employment open to history graduates was teaching, a vocation which had been degraded by the popular saying that the reward of teachers was in heaven rather than in good pay here on earth. No-one wanted to take a gamble of waiting to get to heaven before enjoying the good life. Many universities cleverly changed their Department of History to Department of History and International Relations and they awarded degrees in the latter subject. The Senate's vote to reintroduce history was prompted by Senator Shehu Sani, who had presented a motion calling for pan-Africanism to be taught in schools. A well-known activist, he appeared to have ignored the saying that charity begins at home. What the majority of lawmakers in the Senate have told him is that a person who does not know the history of his own family compound surely cannot seek to settle scores among other families in the clan. More from Sola Odunfa:","In our series of letters from African journalists, Sola Odunfa looks at why it is a good idea for Nigeria to reintroduce history as a school subject - a move recently backed by the country's senate."
"Builder Sebastian Stephenson, 34 from Croydon, hung the poster which said ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" alongside a CCTV photograph of the alleged thief. The police told him he had to change it as it was inciting public disorder. The Met said Mr Stephenson had not been arrested and that the investigation into the theft continues. Mr Stephenson said the alleged thief had targeted him four times and had taken more than £4,000 worth of tools. After the first couple of thefts, he installed CCTV cameras outside his house which filmed the tools being taken. He said he called the police saying ""here is the burglar"" and urged them to send a picture from the Met's Twitter accounts and other social media to raise awareness to other builders. When this did not happen, Mr Stephenson uploaded the CCTV footage to YouTube and paid £300 for a Facebook post on the incident to be promoted to users in the Croydon area. Still frustrated at the police's response, he decided to print the banner. ""I want him to drive back and see his face. [But] within 24 hours the police came back to arrest me for inciting public disorder and said I must take the sign down immediately. When asked why he included the ""Dead or Alive"" line he said: ""Everybody knows it's just a cowboy and western reference, like Clint Eastwood."" He has now marked out the word dead. After the poster went up, he said he had people who lived close by to him saying they had had their tools stolen too. ""Burglary is important. My home has been violated. When I told my wife I was going away for work she said 'you're leaving me alone with a thief' - see it's affecting her. ""At night I'm checking the van through the window to see if it's still there. My children keep asking if I've caught the thief so it's on their mind. ""It's not low-level crime.""

"Delivering the keynote address on the second day at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit at New Delhi, Rajapaksa said his government is equally determined to fight against the terrorism. ""It is necessary for me to repeat here that while my Government remains determined to fight terrorism, we are equally committed to seeking a negotiated and sustainable solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka,"" he told the gathering on Saturday. Democratic solution ""If those who carry arms against the State are willing to enter a process of genuine negotiation towards a peaceful and democratic solution, the government and the people will reciprocate,"" President Rajapaksa added. The Sri Lankan President discussed bilateral issues with the Indian PM, Dr. Manmohan Singh, Congress Party leader Sonia Gandhi and ministers after the speech on Saturday. Rajapaksa re-iterated the importance of India's role in finding a political solution to Sri Lanka's national question. ""We find that India has evolved her own model of governance. This is a uniquely Indian approach which has led to India being universally applauded for its profoundly democratic and pluralist governance structure,"" he said. 'Home-grown' constitution Absence of a ""home-grown"" system of governance is an issue that is currently been addressed by his government, President Rajapaksa said. ""In Sri Lanka, which remains a vibrant democracy, we lacked the advantage of a Constitution drawn up by our own people in keeping with our own ideals of freedom and governance"". Learning from India's experience, Rajapaksa said, it is advisable for Sri Lanka to create its own constitution instead of the one that forced upon by the colonial powers. Sri Lankan President held discussions with diplomats, government officials and representatives from main opposition, BJP, on Sunday.","The President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has insisted that his government is committed to find a political solution to the national question."
"The money will go towards 108 projects already under construction and 187 schemes under consideration. But projects in Leeds, York, Thirsk and Morpeth have been put on hold. Environment Minister Richard Benyon disputed claims from Labour's Mary Creagh that schemes had been cancelled. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons tabled by Ms Creagh, he said better protection was being provided to more than 145,000 homes. He added that just because projects were not included in his announcement it did ""not amount to the government cancelling schemes or saying that any particular scheme cannot go ahead in the future"". The Lib Dem MP for Leeds North West, Greg Mulholland, and the Labour MP for Leeds East, George Mudie, both criticised the decision to shelve flood defence work in the city. Mr Mudie said: ""Leeds city centre came within centimetres of flooding in 2000 and had numerous near misses. This is the largest city in the north and it cannot be allowed to be knocked out by flooding."" Morpeth in Northumberland was badly hit by flooding in 2008 when the river Wansbeck burst its banks and 1,000 homes were inundated. The Labour MP for Wansbeck, Ian Lavery, asked for reassurances for his constituents. But Mr Benyon said: ""No schemes will have been cancelled. All defences already under construction will be completed. ""It's the nature of flood and coastal defence investment that there are always more projects than national budgets can afford at any one time,"" he said. He said funding for projects expected in 2012-13 was under review. ""We have protected front-line services, such as forecasting, warnings and incident response, and the maintenance of existing defences,"" he said. He said the Environment Agency was being asked to find 15% in efficiency savings as part of efforts to concentrate funding on front-line protection. Among details announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) were 39 new flood and coastal defence projects in England. Of the new projects, 21 would provide additional protection to more than 13,000 households at risk of flooding, Mr Benyon said. One of them was £5.7m to be spent protecting 182 houses in Keswick at risk from flooding of the River Derwent. The remainder mainly relate to repairs to existing defences. Among the schemes going ahead are: Insurance premiums The shadow environment secretary said the government had cut the flood defence budget by £95m this year. Ms Creagh said capital funding for flood defence had dropped from £354m to £259m in one year. She said: ""The Tory-led government are taking a reckless gamble with people's homes and businesses by cutting the flood defence budget by 27% in cash terms. ""We know that Leeds has lost out and people across the country face an uncertain future as they wait till next year to hear if their schemes will proceed or be cancelled. ""When Labour's deal with insurance companies to guarantee universal insurance runs out in two years' time, we must not end up in a situation where homes are uninsurable or insurance premiums are unaffordable."" Defra later explained that the figure of 8% given by Mr Benyon in his Commons statement was based on the average annual spend over the past four years - £590m - compared with the £540m average for the next four years. On an annual basis, Defra's spending on flood defences has risen from £500m in 2007-08 to £664m in the current year. That covers both capital programmes and maintenance and operational costs. The Defra announcement comes a day after a government-commissioned report warned of the potential impacts of climate change, including flooding of drainage networks and increased damage to buildings from storms. The report, from the Engineering the Future - an alliance of professional engineering bodies - concluded that complete protection against climate impacts will not be affordable, and society would have to decide what levels of prevention should be funded for various types of threat. Update 10 February: Following clarification from Defra, this story has been amended to explain how the figure of 8% was obtained.","The government will spend £540m a year on flooding defences in England over the next four years - a cut of 8% from previous periods, the environment department has confirmed."
"In the piece , Gopnik - whose name in Russian refers to a drunken hooligan - wrote of the dilemma of parents bestowing unusual monikers. Here are a selection of readers' most ridiculed names: My maiden name was ""Cockett"". Most people in my family were known by their surname just because their friends enjoyed shouting ""COCKETT!"" across the street. When I was at senior school, in the early days of internet filters, replies to my emails would often be blocked, as the first four letters of my surname were automatically starred out. I do strangely miss being a Cockett but get a lot less sniggers when introducing myself as a Tizzard although I guess it's still open to a few jokes. Sarah Tizzard, Dagenham, Essex If you think about many Chinese surnames, or names, they can be really confusing. Not just for non-Chinese, but the Chinese too. My anglicised Mandarin name is Ho Kit Ying (Ho is my surname), but like any good ol' Mandarin name, all the syllables can very well sound like a last name. I could be Miss Ho, or Miss Kit or Miss Ying and all three actually exist as a surname. And then there's the use of ""ho"" in rap songs to mean ""whore"". Suddenly my name sounds like a high class prostitute when I'm address as ""Miss Ho"". That's why I insist all my associates call me Miss Kit, and they're none the wiser! Kit, Singapore My surname is Aisthorpe. Most people find it hard to pronounce but the ""Ais"" is pronounced as ""Ace"". I was told by an Icelandic and a Swedish guy that it means the village of God. I'm quite happy with that. We all come from the Grimsby area. Keith Aisthorpe, Sibu, Malaysia ""Woolfson"" over the phone - nightmare. ""Yes, Woolfson, like son of a wolf. W-O-O-L-F for Freddy-S for Simon-O-N."" And the worst thing? I come from Portugal where W is hard to pronounce. And my poor brother - Zack Woolfson, he's better known as ""Jack Oolsa"". Well done mum and dad. Jessica Woolfson, Cascais, Portugal My surname, Or, is a phonetic translation of the Chinese. It can be quite a nuisance when bureaucracies recognise it as the conjunctive ""or"", and instead choose my middle name (also Chinese) as my surname. My parents also have plenty trouble when they have joint accounts, the names often are: ""my father's first and middle name OR my mother."" Underlining or using all caps only contribute to the confusion. In everyday usage, I have often have the ""Brian or what?"" and being in Canada, being asked whether I am related to the hockey great Bobby Orr. Over the years I have learnt to emphasize when pronouncing ""Or"" so people recognize it as a last name. Brian Or, Toronto, Canada I'm Jonny Large, yet I'm 5ft 5in tall. I've always been short, just to keep the irony consistent across my life time. My actual first name is Jonathan, and whilst I realise that adding the words ""large"" and ""jonny"" in this country is mickey-taking suicide thanks to the condom euphemism, I prefer being called Jonny to Jon or Jonathan. I've learnt to not be bothered by it and I like to think that for all the reasons my surname gave people a chance to poke fun as I was growing up, that it has made me a lot more resistant to that sort of thing in the adult world. Jonny Large, Hitchin, UK My maiden name is Kasecamp. I'm told it's German and means something along the line of ""maker of cheese"" though I can't really be sure. The surname is apparently only in existence in this small community in Western Maryland, having been settled by our German ancestors. When I married my husband a few years ago, I took his last name in the hopes that having a shorter but equally as unusual name would make life (and the naming of future children) easier. But alas, Bena, it seems, is just as strange and even more likely to be mispronounced. (One must assume a second invisible ""n"" in the spelling to accurately achieve the pronunciation.) We just cannot win. Amanda Kasecamp Bena, Frostburg, Maryland, USA My surname is not unusual but my first name sounds like a surname and vice versa. If I had a pound for everyone that thought Pearse was my surname and addressed me as ""Ken"" thinking they were being matey, well I could have had lots of pounds. A few (educated) will try ""'Piers"" which is a good stab, though most will assume ""Percy"". I've got no problem with people getting my name wrong, after all it's not very common, I just get annoyed with people who think that somehow I've got it wrong and they need to put me right! Pearse Kenny, Wotton-under-Edge, Glos When I was young I hated my name as the overall combination is reminiscent of Nelly the Elephant and led to teasing. Now I am grown up and just graduated in graphic design and I think my name is an asset that will give me an edge on others. Emma Element, Bedford I think my surname has helped shape my personality. I don't think you can have a surname like ""Everhard"" without having a sense of humour! I wasn't the biggest fan of it as a child, but as I've grown up I've learned to have fun with it, and watch as people try and avoid laughing when I tell them! Dan Everhard, Clevedon, England Cold callers generally ask for Mr Roswell, very convenient as I just say he doesn't live here. Overseas callers seem to do better, I think they liken it to Rassul as a base for the name. I've been called the obvious like Russell but the most obscure was Groundsell. Tony Rowsell, Hartlepool, UK My surname is Cock. No ""s"" on the end or ""x"" to make it seem less rude. Just plain old Cock. It was the bane of my life when I was in secondary school - the source of much laughter and ribald jokes. Character building I am told - but at the time just felt like bullying. And even now - no-one believes it can be just Cock so I am often Cocks, Cox or even Colk. I have a cyber-marriage to my boyfriend (whose name is Fullwood - no chance of hyphenating those two names) as Facebook refused to accept this was my surname and thought I was being rude. Hey-ho it's part of my identity now and i wouldn't change it! Kathryn Cock, Bodmin, Cornwall My name is a constant cause of humour in my current job as a prison officer (Cosh 'em). However, I was previously in engineering and had cause to visit my namesake town of Cosham in Hampshire where I attended an appointment to find the chief engineer's name who I came to see was a Mr Kickham and his deputy a Mr Basham (I kid you not). Imagine the mirth at reception when I booked in - Cosham, Kickham and Basham. Bill Cosham, Lowestoft, Suffolk As you can see my name is a bit fishy. Was a nightmare as a small kid. Once my mum tried to con me by saying the other kids laughed at it because they were jealous. I thought ""mum I'm 8, I'm not stupid, thats not true"". But you get used to it and it kinda toughens you up a bit. When I was in the army, my nickname was Billy after Billy the Fish, a cartoon character in a certain adult humour comic. I've been living in Denmark for the last 15 years now and when I say my surname to a Dane they don't even bat an eyelid, even if you tell them it's a fish Stewart Trout, Ringsted, Denmark Not the original family name which, was simply Nutt, but an attempt at social elevation around 1900. The addition of ""Van"" being a bogus claim to Old Dutch New Amsterdam aristocracy. Why on earth didn't they just change the ""Nutt"" bit? A question that still haunts those of us that bear the curse of this dreadful and difficult to pronounce surname. Robert Van Nutt, New York City, USA My name has been a stumbling block for years! Despite being British born and bred, my parents parents opted to give my brother and I names that reflected our Ashanti heritage. I suppose I got off lightly with ""Kwadjo Aboagye""; my brother has had to deal with the epithet of ""Nana Kwame Adu Twum Aboagye"". The name ""Aboagye"" literally means ""animal, get!"" I have often re-interpreted this as ""get the animal"" or even ""hunter"". Indeed, in more recent years, I have truncated my first name to just ""Jo"" but then I generally then get mistaken for a girl: weird for a six foot, 17 stone black guy with dreadlocks! Kwadjo Aboagye, Leeds I still get the jokes, particularly around events or party invites. But the stick I got was worse at school. At uni my friends delighted in referring to me as Cumming of Dorking. Also, my mother's maiden name was Dicks. I'm sure everyone was far too proper (and innocent) to snigger at the wedding vows though. Unbelievably, at junior school I think we shared a school run with the Going family for a while. I'd love to get married and lose my surname in many ways - but only to someone with a normal name! Emily Cumming, London Emma L-Y-S-K-A-V-A. If I had a penny for every time I've had to spell my surname, well, you know how the saying goes... I think my first name lures people into a false sense of security and them BAM I hit them with a surname like Lyskava (luh-skaa-va). I used to wish that I had an easy to spell English surname as I got sick of spelling it out and felt embarrassed for those who stumbled across all the consonants which the Polish language is so fond of, but now I rather like it. It's interesting and different and I don't want to get rid of it if/when I marry. Emma Lyskava, Manchester I'm a journalist currently writing for Kerrang! magazine with the last name Longbottom. I was torn between using a pen name and using my own name. Ultimately used my own name as it's distinctive and I feel a sense of family pride/heritage every time I see it in print. John Longbottom, London My surname is one that, as a boy, I vowed that I would have changed the second my grandparents died - I didn't want them to know how difficult it was growing up with it. Originating from Malta, where the name is an incredibly common one with no stigma (it doesn't have the feminine edge to Sultan as carried by the name elsewhere in the world), to have it transposed to the UK where jibes and insults are racked up in the multitude meant a trying childhood for my brother and I. My brother changed schools on a couple of occasions to avoid bullying. Thankfully, this experience has hardened both his and my attitude to such behaviour and, as a young man, my brother became physically able to dissuade any such assaults. I went the other way and tried to make light of my surname first, undercutting any attacks, with that desire to keep anyone I met comfortable with my name, leading eventually becoming a DJ and entertainer. In my early-thirties, my name became something I was comfortable with - although I felt especially guilty when it was one I then bestowed on my wife, two years ago. I have no idea what to say to my children when I eventually have them about their own experiences, I really don't. Leonard Sultana, Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire Having the surname ""Beauchamp"" - pronounced ""Beecham"" - has caused me no end of grief. My family and I are all used to spelling it out for people and correcting those who attempt to pronounce it in a French way. The name has been in England since around 1066 and the pronunciation has obviously changed since then, but I have had people argue with me, at length, that I pronounce my own surname wrong. My latest response is to tell them that if you ask a taxi driver to go to Beauchamp Place in London by pronouncing it in a French way, they won't have a clue where you mean. My family are descendants of the Beauchamp who was imprisoned in the Tower of London, and subsequently had the Tower named after him. I like it as a name - it's an interesting historical name, with a coat of arms and a motto which is always nice to have - but I do wish people would stop ""correcting"" me on how to pronounce it! Annie Beauchamp, London Not so much an unusual surname (although it is), but a tiresome combination of first and surnames. Everyone thinks they are the funny when they they jokingly ask ""George *the* Forth?"", presumably not considering that I have heard that regularly throughout my entire life. Over 30 years of people thinking they are punning originally is incredibly tiresome. But not as tiresome as my school's eccentric music teacher who thought it tremendously amusing to say at least twice a year (or more - it certainly felt like it): ""Go forth and multiply, he said, but he came fifth and lost."" Even spelling it out is a pain - ""Is that Fourth like the number?"" ""No, it's Forth like the bridge."" ""What...?"" You'd think the Forth Bridge was well known - I assure you there is a significant proportion of the (admittedly younger) population who have no idea what I'm talking about. George Forth, Slough I was born in Denmark, so Helle was not unusual. However, I married an American named Jack Berry - now people expect Halle Berry. Has not been funny for a long time. When people see my name, I usually say ""Yes, it is really my name."" Helle K Berry, Racine, WI, US I'm Neven Salom - my surname is Salom, as you can see. Not the most unusual of surnames, but not the most common either, especially for a Bosnian, that isn't Jewish, or religious at all, like me. I'm half Christian and half Jewish through blood, but agnostic and spiritual personally. In short, I describe myself as a ""Bosnian born Brit"". I find my surname funny, and so do others, and it's always a good and funny way of starting a conversation with someone, especially if you just met them. I say ""Shalom"", sometimes, when joking around with friends and people. Some people, such as at work, actually think that you pronounce my surname as ""Shalom"", instead of ""Salom"", which can be awkward, which can get a tad irritating, frustrating and tiresome (explaining) at times, but it's a low number of people, and I just try to think of the funny side. Neven Salom, Cricklewood, London, England, United Kingdom My surname is my married name. I married and actually changed my name from Thomas to Rosbottom. My husband and I come from the same town and I've found out that our surname is one which is very local to Wigan. There aren't many of us about and in fact, there is a Rosbottom Facebook page upon which, someone asked if anyone had ever met another Rosbottom to whom they weren't related. When I asked my husband, he said that he hadn't. We are a dwindling breed as at least one of my husband's cousins has changed his surname so that his family wouldn't - and I'm paraphrasing here - have to go through what he'd gone through as a child. The odd thing was, when we emigrated to the US, I found a whole batch of Rosbottoms living within 20 miles of us! Catherine Rosbottom, Louisville, KY, US (but originally from Wigan, Lancashire)",Adam Gopnik's piece on much-ridiculed names drew a large response from readers lumbered with nominal millstones.
"Lynne Owens said the threat from criminal gangs is ""staggering"" and that the public will ""feel the consequences"" if the extra funds are not found. She said the investment should include more than doubling the NCA's annual budget from £424m to nearly £1.1bn. The government says it invests in the right tools for law enforcement. The agency's annual review of organised crime says there are more than 4,500 groups with 37,000 members in the UK. Speaking in central London, Ms Owens argued that the threat from drug dealers, cyber criminals, human trafficking gangs and sexual predators was growing ""in scale and complexity"". Ms Owens told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the NCA faces a ""chronic and corrosive threat"". She said: ""It's a number of things, it's globalisation, it's the rapid use and expansion of technology, it's the development of encryption and it's the demand for services - it's the supply of drugs, and we are a nation unfortunately, with a high demand for drugs. ""It's paedophiles using the dark web to target children in their bedrooms, those who dominate communities using fear and violence through the trade of drugs and firearms and illicit finance and cyber crime."" How organised crime is changing: When asked about reports indicating that the number of organised crime groups has fallen over the past year, Ms Owens said ""that's quite an old-fashioned way of looking at things. ""For example offenders operating on the dark web might only network through technology. So they won't be part of a traditional organisation, but they are a network of like-minded individuals and that is why we get to a higher figure of offenders."" At present the NCA spends £424m a year and has approximately 4,500 staff. By contrast, it estimates that 181,000 offenders can be ultimately linked to serious and organised crime - from drug dealing through to people trafficking, cyber extortion and the trade in online sexual abuse imagery. Ms Owens calculates that British investigators now need an extra £2.7bn over three years - to include an extra £650m annually for her agency. She says that extra cash would be less than the weekly estimated cost of organised crime to the UK. ""Enhancing our capabilities is critical to our national security. If we don't, the whole of UK law enforcement, and therefore the public, will feel the consequences. Some will say we cannot afford to provide more investment, but I say we cannot afford not to."" Responding to the NCA's call for more cash, security minister Ben Wallace acknowledged the scale of the threat - but did not immediately promise any more spending. ""Our serious organised crime strategy, published in November 2018, set out how we will mobilise the full force of the state to target and disrupt serious and organised crime. ""As criminals' use of technology evolves so must our response. We continue to invest in the right capabilities and tools in law enforcement, across government and in partnership with the private sector."" How big is the challenge? If the NCA could arrest all the gang members it knows about, they'd fill enough double-decker buses to jam every major road between the agency's headquarters and the Home Office, where its budget is set (trust me - I'll spare you the maths). The call for more cash isn't just an operational matter - it is a big political challenge after many other warnings from police leaders about cuts. If ministers found this huge pile of extra cash down the Whitehall sofa, it would go on not only investigators but resources for digital forensic and specialist surveillance operations. The challenge would still be enormous - here's just one example of how quickly organised criminals shift their focus: The UK's introduction of a forgery-proofed polymer £10 note has been followed by a surge in counterfeit £20s and £50s. As fast as investigators catch up, the criminal has found a new way to make a profit. The NCA's sixth annual review of organised crime says groups have been fragmenting and capitalising on new technology not only to hide their identities but to increase their profits. The rise of virtual or crypto currencies - which can be exceptionally difficult to track - is helping offenders launder their profits more efficiently without leaving a trail for investigators to pick up. On cyber-crime specifically, the UK is fighting sustained attempts by Russian-speaking gangs to make money by targeting British computers - either through ransom attacks that lock up systems or through the theft of personal banking credentials. One of the biggest threats has been the rise in sites in hidden parts of the internet where images of sexual abuse of children are traded. The NCA estimates that 144,000 of the people involved in these dark web sites are based in the UK - 5% of all known users. And it warns that Brexit will not only affect the ability of the NCA to work efficiently with its partners in the EU but could also lead to an increase in bribery and corruption as British companies enter into new markets around the world.","The UK ""can't afford not to"" spend an extra £3bn on fighting organised crime over the next three years, the head of the National Crime Agency has warned."
"The city council said the annual number of passengers walking between the New Street and Moor Street stations could rise from 1.4m to 2.3m when HS2 is complete. The One Station scheme would improve the walkway between them and possibly expand the plaza around New Street. The council's cabinet will meet to discuss the proposal on 30 June. The councillor responsible for development and transport, Tahir Ali, said: ""There is a real need to enhance this area and provide improved connections not only between these stations but to other destinations in the city centre."" A cycle hub would also be considered and work could start in spring 2015.

"The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began an inquiry into whether Ann Barnes was legally insured after the crash in Dartford in September. The investigation has now been widened. Mrs Barnes's office said the PCC could not comment during an ongoing inquiry. A spokesman for the IPCC said it was investigating whether the PCC had appropriate insurance to cover business use of her car when she was involved in the car crash. He said the IPCC had set out its terms of reference for the inquiry, which would also determine how long the relevant insurance was not in place, if that was the case. ""The IPCC is also investigating whether a police constable was obstructed in the execution of their duty when initial enquiries in the PCC's insurance cover were being made by Kent Police,"" he added. The crash on 16 September involving Mrs Barnes's Mercedes was referred to the IPCC by the PCC's office on 26 September. Mrs Barnes's crashed with another car and hit a tree in Princes Road. No-one was seriously hurt.",The police watchdog is investigating whether an officer was obstructed during inquiries into a crash involving Kent's police and crime commissioner.
"Russian forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, drawing international condemnation. The region, which has a Russian-speaking majority, is now shown as Russian territory on Apple Maps and its Weather app, when viewed from Russia. But the apps do not show it as part of any country when viewed elsewhere. The State Duma, the Russian parliament's lower house, said in a statement: ""Crimea and Sevastopol now appear on Apple devices as Russian territory."" Russia treats the naval port city of Sevastopol as a separate region. The BBC tested several iPhones in Moscow and it appears the change affects devices set up to use the Russian edition of Apple's App Store. Apple had been in talks with Russia for several months over what the State Duma described as ""inaccuracy"" in the way Crimea was labelled. The tech giant originally suggested it could show Crimea as undefined territory - part of neither Russia nor Ukraine. But Vasily Piskaryov, chairman of the Duma security and anti-corruption committee, said Apple had complied with the Russian constitution. He said representatives of the company were reminded that labelling Crimea as part of Ukrainian territory was a criminal offence under Russian law, according to Interfax news agency. ""There is no going back,"" Mr Piskaryov said. ""Today, with Apple, the situation is closed - we have received everything we wanted."" He said Russia was always open to ""dialogue and constructive co-operation with foreign companies"". Apple has not yet commented on the decision. Google, which also produces a popular Maps app, also shows Crimea as belonging to Russia when viewed from the country. The changes happened in March. When Google Maps is viewed from Ukraine, the maps show no clear border between Crimea and Ukraine but also no border between Crimea and Russia, according to BBC Monitoring. Most of the international community, including the EU and the US, does not recognise the annexation of Crimea to Russia. The loss of Crimea is a deep wound for Ukrainians. Shortly after the peninsula was annexed in early 2014, a separate conflict broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions when separatists moved against the Ukrainian state. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists. Moscow denies this but says that Russian volunteers are helping the rebels. More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict. The BBC does not show Crimea as part of Russia on its maps, but shows a dotted line to mark disputed territory.

"The parliament is made up of 60 young people, 40 of whom were elected in an online ballot, with a further 20 from organisations and charities. The first meeting will take place in February and the winning candidates will each serve a two-year term. Cardiff West winner Manon Clarke said it was ""incredible"" to have a chance to ensure young people's voices would be heard ""for the first time"". Manon, from Ysgol Gyfun Plasmawr, said joining the new parliament ""means so much to me"", and she had ""put in a lot of work promoting myself on social media platforms"" to get there. ""I think the voice of someone aged 11 to 18 is just as important as any other,"" she told BBC Wales Today. ""I think often young people's voices go unheard, and for the first time ever we have the chance, so it's incredible."" All 11 to 18-year-olds in Wales were eligible to vote, with about 13,000 registering to choose from a group of 480 candidates. Partner organisations include Girlguiding Cymru, Youth Cymru, Tros Gynnal Plant, Voices from Care, Barnardo's Cymru and Learning Disability Wales, with the aim of ensuring diversity and inclusivity for the new body. Greta Evans, said it was ""an honour"" to be representing Welsh language youth body the Urdd in the parliament, and she wanted to promote Welsh in schools and ""as a national language"". She also wanted to address mental health issues, she said. ""I see it in my friends, I see it in my year group, it's everywhere and it's something we definitely need to tackle,"" Greta said. ""And the third thing is the environment. There are lots of issues with plastic and pollution, especially in Cardiff, so those are the issues we're definitely going to be tackling."" Evan Burgess, from Aberconwy said it was a chance to tackle issues children face by bringing those issues to a national level. Speaking before the results were announced, at the beginning of Senedd proceedings, he said: ""There are issues you will face as a child no matter where you are in Wales and to bring those issues and problems up to a national level is going to be a really good way to tackle those problems."" During the campaign Evan said his top priorities were growing the Welsh economy, increasing sustainable tourism and improving transport. Presiding Officer Elin Jones said it was ""more than appropriate"" that young people had the chance to discuss their futures and ""inform"" the opinions of AMs. She said: ""The Senedd itself will listen to the voice of young people and there will be a mutual respect. ""There will be debate between the young people and the National Assembly itself, so that they do ultimately influence policies and decisions that will be taken that will affect their lives more so than any of ours."" She added the parliament will not just be a ""talking shop"".",The members of the first Welsh Youth Parliament have been announced.
"Prince Philip passed away, aged 99, at Windsor Castle on Friday morning. He was known for his love of the sea, having spent time in the Royal Navy and in later life competing in regattas. As well as the sea, locations in the South such as Broadlands in Hampshire, also played key roles in his life. He joined the Royal Navy in 1939 and graduated top of his class in 1940. Some of his training was carried out in Portsmouth and he went on to become one of the youngest first lieutenants. In 1952, he was promoted to commander but his naval career came to an end when his father-in-law, King George VI, died. In later life he regularly competed at Cowes Regatta on the Isle of Wight. He struck up a long friendship with island-based boat builder and yachtsman Uffa Fox. They competed together at the annual regatta in the Solent many times. After making the decision to stop racing at the event in 1997, Prince Philip said: ""You get to a stage in life when people say, 'are you still doing something or other?', and you begin to realise you probably shouldn't still be doing something or other. ""I had to give this up sooner or later."" To mark the bicentenary of the island's prestigious and exclusive yacht club, the Royal Yacht Squadron, Prince Philip, who was its admiral, led a royal party to review more than 180 members' boats at Cowes in 2015. A previous visit to the island came in 2012 as part of the Queen's nationwide Diamond Jubilee tour. The Queen and the duke arrived at Cowes on the last day of the tour on the motor yacht Leander. They were greeted by a spectacular crowd and received a 21-gun salute, fired from the Royal Yacht Squadron. Prince Philip's career in the Royal Navy, which saw him rise to the rank of commander, also made him a regular visitor to Portsmouth. He followed the restoration of HMS Warrior in the Historic Dockyard in 1977 with the Queen - reviewing the fleet in the Solent. The couple reviewed the fleet again in 2005 to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar's 200th anniversary. About 165 ships from 65 nations took part in the event. The vast majority of the duke's visits were for openings, with the duke regularly cutting a ribbon or unveiling a plaque. The opening of the then-new Royal Marines Museum in Southsea in 2008 prompted a quip from the duke, who introduced himself as ""the world's most experienced plaque unveiler"". Due to the threat of coronavirus in 2020, both he and the Queen had been living under the same roof at Windsor Castle - dubbed HMS Bubble. It mirrored a time at the start of their marriage in 1947, beginning with their honeymoon at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire. One happy moment was captured during the first lockdown of 2020, when the Queen and Prince Philip posed for a joint photograph at Windsor to mark the duke's 99th birthday in June. During the second lockdown the couple also celebrated being married for 73 years on 20 November. After retiring from public duties in 2017, the duke reportedly divided his time between Sandringham and Windsor. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News, Davos ""But it has just become this massive movement and a lot of a young people really look up to us."" Ms Wijsen is not your average teenager. At the age of 12, she and her 10-year-old sister Isabel decided something had to be done about the plastic waste clogging up the oceans around the Indonesian island of Bali where they live. So they launched a grassroots campaign on the island named Bye Bye Plastic Bags, which - after years of hard work - resulted in the local government banning single-use plastic bags, straws and styrofoam in 2019. Melati has spent the last year telling her story, and in the process joined a growing crop of young environmental activists making headlines around the world - the best known of whom is the 17-year-old climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. 'Ignorant' politicians Reflecting the current vogue for youth activism, Melati, Greta and several others have been invited to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this year - a conference not exactly lauded for its environmental record. The media has highlighted the fact that the biggest name taking part in the elite business conference this year will be US President Donald Trump - a man who has dismissed the threat of global warming and attacked attempts to ban single-use plastics as a liberal conspiracy. ""Unfortunately, some politicians are ignorant and refuse to look face-to-face at the issues,"" Ms Wijsen tells the BBC. ""For those trying to make changes, we see that the intentions are in the right place but the change is not happening fast enough."" When I meet Melati at Davos it's clear that her work as an activist is all-consuming. She has travelled for 26 hours from Indonesia to be in Davos and will be having 10 meetings a day at the conference. Back at home things are similarly full on. She has postponed university to work on Bye Bye Plastic Bag full time, and the NGO is now active in 29 countries. She also recently launched a second charity - called Youthtopia - aimed at inspiring other young change-makers to pursue their goals. Does she have time to do normal 19-year-old things like hang out with friends or party? ""This really is now everything to me but I've realised it is also important to take care of yourself. I am still learning about balance,"" Melati says. Her Indonesian father and Dutch mother - both of whom have a background as entrepreneurs - are very supportive, she says, which helps. Her mother has even given up her job to join Melati's campaign group and her boyfriend - the activist film-maker Gary Bencheghib - has accompanied her to Davos this year. It is this combination of vulnerability and steeliness that enables teen activists like Ms Wijsen and Ms Thunberg to grab our attention in a way that most adult campaigners cannot. ""People know kids are not politicians and they trust them,"" explains Kaveh Madani, an environmental activist and professor at the Department of Political Science at Yale University. ""They mean what they say, so they affect your emotions and you listen. You might not care about the length of your shower or your electric bill, but when your kids come back from school and talk about climate change, even if you don't care about climate change you won't tell them to shut up."" The Iranian professor says the work of people like Ms Wijsen represents the best of grassroots mobilisation. He also likes the fact that she has raised awareness in the developing world. But he warns there is a caveat to seeing youngsters active at this scale. ""I would be concerned if we misuse or hide behind children when we have a political agenda. We've already seen adults attack Greta and come up with conspiracy theories."" His big concern is that people in positions of power could ""give them too much responsibility or put words in their mouth"", and the child or the movements themselves could be harmed. Will this happen to the youth activists taking part in the World Economic Forum this year? Every year major emitters of greenhouse gases or producers of plastics attend the glitzy conference. And while many are have pledged to reform, almost none have said they will do so as fast as campaigners say is necessary. Ms Wijsen understands why people think working with the ""Davos crowd"" is a risk, but she sees things differently. ""We need to get rid of this sense of divide because we need to collaborate on all levels, we need to understand both sides of the story."" She says all of us - businesses and world leaders included - face a simple choice: change or risk creating an uninhabitable planet. She adds that young change-makers are more ready for the right than some might suggest. ""Davos has been going for 50 years, but in 50 years' time what is this conference going to mean? This is a pivotal moment where we get to decide, and the fact that for the very first time young people are getting invited shows there is a shift and it's a global shift.""","""It is a lot of responsibility - if you would have told my 12-year-old self that it would be at this level of intensity, opportunity and possibility, I wouldn't have believed you,"" says 19-year-old environmental activist Melati Wijsen of her environmental campaign work."
"The impasse was caused by an uproar over alleged corruption in the allocation of coalfield concessions. The opposition BJP wants the government to cancel the awards and hold an independent probe. PM Manmohan Singh said the ""disruption"" of parliament by the opposition was a ""grave violation of norms of parliamentary office"". Earlier this week, police raided companies which allegedly misrepresented facts prior to being awarded coalfield concessions. State auditors say India lost $33bn (£20bn) awarding coalfields at below market rates in the years up to 2009. The auditors' report does not mention Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but BJP leaders say he must step down because he had direct responsibility for the coal ministry when most of the awards were made. Mr Singh denies any wrongdoing and has refused to resign. ""The opposition saw fit to demand my resignation before parliament was even allowed to take a view on the auditor's report,"" he said after the session concluded on Friday. BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said the opposition had raised the issue of coal allocations in the ""interests of the nation"" and that stalling the parliament was one of the ways to oppose the government. Parliament was deadlocked for 13 of the 20 days of the monsoon session. Some 30 bills were due to be considered and passed during the session, but very little legislative work was done. ""This session is likely to be remembered for the work that was not done,"" the chairman of the upper house, Hamid Ansari, said.",The latest session of India's parliament has ended without resolving deadlock which paralysed it for days.
"At a special sitting of Chief Pleas in August, the General Purposes and Advisory Committee will propose a temporary chief secretary be appointed. He or she would then be responsible for consulting on, and then implementing, the reforms proposed by former UK senior civil servant Belinda Crowe. These include reducing the number of committees and increasing transparency. Ms Crowe also recommended the creation of a small civil service, to reduce the burden on those setting policy and enable better economic planning. 'No help' The report was discussed at a public meeting on Wednesday night, which was attended by about a quarter of the island's electorate of 456. Charles Maitland, the chair of the General Purposes and Advisory Committee, said nobody spoke out against the Crowe Report's conclusions during the meeting. He said there was widespread acceptance that reform was required. ""We have 28 conseillers but they have no help at all in performing their duties,"" he said. ""The chairmen of the important committees are really struggling to cope with the amount of work."" Mr Maitland said Sark had already consulted with Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey and the Isle of Man about the creation of the post, which he said would be advertised widely.","A new post is to be created in Sark to push through reforms to the island's government, if conseillers approve."
"Market researchers Kantar Worldpanel said there was an overall growth of 0.3% in the 12 weeks to 14 August, boosted by the warm weather. Lidl and Aldi recorded like-for-like sales growth of 12.2% and 10.4%. Tesco had a sales drop of 0.4% compared with 2015, the slowest in six months. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""Current trends suggest the retailer may return to growth this year, which would mark the end of a decline stretching back to March 2015."" Asda remained at the bottom, with sales down 5.5%. Last week, Asda reported its worst quarterly performance on record. Sainsbury's saw sales fall 0.6% and Morrisons by 1.8%. Sunshine sales Market researcher Nielsen, which has published industry data in the 12 weeks up to 13 August, found similar trends. It and Kantar noted that promotional sales had dropped, reflecting the big four supermarkets' move towards simpler pricing models and permanent price cuts. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said the big four supermarkets were simplifying ""the overall customer offer in response to the growth of the discounters by lowering the level of promotions and reducing multi-buys, instead moving to permanent price cuts"". He added that the hot weather and success at Rio had helped boost overall supermarket sales. ""Brexit seems to have been replaced by an Olympic 'feel-good' factor among shoppers and there were more visits to buy food and drink in the last four weeks than this time last year."" Nielsen said the strongest category performances were in soft drinks, with mineral water sales up by 18.5%. This was followed by frozen foods driven by ice-cream sales. Kantar said grocery price inflation remained negative, with a representative basket of goods 1.3% cheaper than it was last year.","German discount chains Lidl and Aldi have continued to grab market share from the big four supermarkets, which all reported a drop in sales, according to market data."
"Cardiff specialists who led the UK arm of the trial which studied 5,000 women found less invasive methods can be as effective as surgery for some patients. It also means radiotherapy could be used instead to remove lymph nodes. Consultant breast surgeon Prof Robert Mansel said it could mean fewer women requiring additional surgery. The trial studied nearly 5,000 women to see if radiotherapy was equivalent to surgical removal of lymph nodes in the armpit. Prof Mansel, of the University Hospital Llandough, and professor of surgery at Cardiff University's School of Medicine (Institute of Cancer and Genetics), was chief investigator for the UK study. ""This is a very important trial because it is going to change practice,"" he said. ""What normally happens nowadays is we check the lymph nodes under the arm when we do the first operation for breast cancer, and if there is spread to those to lymph nodes, conventionally at the moment, all the remaining lymph nodes are removed - it is a big operation. ""What the trial shows is you don't need to remove those lymph nodes, because you can actually treat under the arm area by radiotherapy instead. ""This is the first trial to show this conclusively. This is nearly 5,000 patients who have been studied. The rate of any problem coming back in the arm is actually tiny. ""It is in the order of 1% - and it is no different from doing surgery."" Prof Mansel said adopting a radiotherapy approach, rather than secondary surgery, would lead to swifter recovery with fewer side effects for patients - and cost the NHS less. 'Fantastic' research ""It has great potential for savings in the NHS, which is unusual, because we will do less surgery,"" he said. ""That means saving on expensive operating theatre time, and the patient is having radiotherapy anyway to the breast area."" Alison Essaye, from Tondu, Bridgend, had surgery for breast cancer four years ago, followed by radiotherapy. She said: ""I think it's fantastic what they've done with the research and the study. ""Because if you had to go through a second lot of surgery, that's going to be even more painful again. ""They have got good results for the future, for women and men - and we mustn't forget the men."" The trial started in 2007, and 85 patients from the Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan took part, alongside some patients from Manchester. Chris Morris, a research nurse with the National Institute for Social Care and Health Research, said the study's findings could ""improve future patients' experience.""",Some breast cancer sufferers could be treated with radiotherapy instead of more invasive surgery after a Europe-wide study.
"Emergency services were called to Cornwood Close, Belle Vale, shortly before 11:30 BST following reports a man had been shot in the street. He was treated at the scene for critical injuries to the head and torso, but was pronounced dead in hospital. Detectives said they had launched a murder investigation. A Merseyside Police spokesman said they were looking for a man, in his late 20s, dressed in black and with a high-vis orange jacket. Det Ch Supt Natalie Perischine said: ""The investigation into this shocking incident is in its very early stages.

"The Beverley Gate was where King Charles I was refused entry to Hull in 1642, sparking the English Civil War. Last year, the authority wanted to cover up the site for its City of Culture 2017 plans but ruled it out after a campaign against the idea. It said the stainless steel statue would be ""an engaging piece of art"". Entitled Shadow Gate, the artwork would be positioned to the south west of Beverley Gate, between Whitefriargate and King Edward Street. Architects Tonkin Liu said: ""Shadow Gate invokes the imagery of the trading ships masts and sails in the urban realm at Beverley Gate. ""Careful consideration has been made to position the sculpture to minimise any harmful impact to surrounding historical buildings."" The council said it was ""unable to supply costs"" of the project as it was part of the City of Culture 2017 public realm works. Last month the authority approved revised plans to revamp Beverley Gate, after people voted for the site to be left open and redeveloped with amphitheatre-style seating and glass fencing to replace the existing rails. The remains were granted protection by the government in January because of the ""national importance of Hull's 14th Century town walls"". Final decision for approving the revamp scheme will be given by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.",Plans for a new 33ft (10m) tall sculpture to be erected next to Hull's ancient defence walls have been submitted by the city council.
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter ""I didn't do this stuff. This is not me,"" he told CBS This Morning, adding that he is ""fighting for my life"". Chicago prosecutors have charged Kelly with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, involving four alleged victims, three of whom were minors. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges and is currently out on bail. If convicted, he faces three to seven years in prison for each crime. The case follows a 2002 trial, in which Kelly faced 21 counts of child pornography, stemming from a sex tape with a girl who was alleged to be underage. The jury eventually concluded they could not prove the girl on the tape was a minor and Kelly was found not guilty on all counts. Speaking to CBS news reporter Gayle King, Kelly said the earlier trial was being used to give the latest accusations credence. ""They're going back to the past and they're trying to add all of this stuff now to that, to make all of the stuff that's going on now feel real to people,"" he said, in a clip released ahead of the full interview. ""But the past is relevant with you with underage girls,"" Gayle replied. ""Absolutely no it's not,"" Kelly protested. ""Because, for one I beat my case. You can't double jeopardy me like that. When you beat your case, you beat your case"". The star also denied accusations, raised in the recent documentary Surviving R. Kelly, that he held women against their will, confiscating their phones, restricting their food, and denying them access to their families. Becoming emotional, he asked King: ""How stupid would it be for R Kelly, with all I've been through to hold somebody? How stupid would I be to do that?"" ""Use your common sense,"" he continued, raising his voice and turning to address the camera. ""Forget the blogs, forget how you feel about me. Hate me if you want to; love me if you want. But just use your common sense."" ""How stupid would it be for me with my crazy past and what I've been through [to say], 'Oh right now, I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will and chain them up in my basement?"" ""Quit playing, quit playing,"" he said, becoming tearful. ""This is not me."" At this point, Kelly stood up, pounding his fist and beating his chest as he declared: ""Are you all trying to kill me?"" 'Severe mental abuse' King spoke to the singer for 80 minutes on Tuesday, 5 March. CBS broadcast excerpts on Wednesday and Thursday morning. Among the interview's most notable moments: Speaking in the studio, King told her co-presenters: ""I think he needs help. He became very emotional many, many times. I thought, in some ways, we were seeing a breakdown right in front of our eyes."" ""He does think the world is out to get him and everyone is lying,"" she added. King has also interviewed two women, Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage, who are currently in a relationship with Kelly. That segment will be shown on Friday - but a preview clip showed Clary, who is 21, breaking down in tears as she defended the star. ""I'm crying because you guys don't know the truth,"" she said. ""This is all lies for money. If you can't see that, you're ignorant and you're stupid."" Ahead of the broadcast, Clary's parents, who says Kelly is holding their daughter against her will, issued a statement condemning the star. ""We love our daughter Azriel very much and we miss her,"" said Alice and Angelo Clary. ""Azriel suffered severe mental abuse at the hands of R Kelly for years. She's also likely suffering from symptoms similar to those found with Stockholm Syndrome. ""R. Kelly is a liar, manipulator and sociopath who must be brought to justice for his decades of sexual assaults on underage girls. All these victims and their parents cannot be lying.""

"The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales - Hefcw - said it reflected its response to ""significant reductions"" to resources over two years. In total, the sector will get £99.3m from the body over the 2017-18 academic year, down from £127.6m in 2016-17. It comes as several Welsh universities warn of job losses over funding. Bangor University became the latest to announce it was in talks with unions about potential cuts affecting up to 170 posts. It follows similar discussions at other institutions, including Aberystwyth, University of Wales Trinity St David, and University of South Wales. The Welsh Government funded body, Hefcw is responsible for setting university fees, and also assessing standards. However, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams announced in January it will be replaced with a body covering all post-16 education and research. Announcing the settlement for the next year, Hefcw said its funding now represented less than 10% of the income generated by universities in Wales as they able to charge up to £9,000 a year in tuition fees. ""Higher education providers' income also reflects their successes in achieving additional earnings from competitive grant capture, a range of commercial activities and recruitment of international students,"" added Hefcw chief executive Dr David Blaney. Student finance across Wales is expected to see a massive shake-up in 2018-19, when the Welsh Government implements recommendations from the Diamond Review, which will overhaul how loans and tuition grant payments are made. In the meantime, Dr Blaney said Hefcw would ""continue to invest the resources available to us in priority areas"" to ""provide a high quality student experience that is accessible to all and which produces highly skilled and employable graduates"".","Higher education bodies in Wales will get £28.3m less funding in the coming year, it has been announced."
"By Charlie HaynesBBC News British Dental Association (BDA) analysis, seen by the BBC, shows practices operating at a fraction of their capacity during the pandemic. It warns hundreds of practices could be forced to close within the next year without extra financial support. The government said the NHS was working hard to restore dental care. New coronavirus regulations mean dentists have had to significantly reduce the numbers they treat - in order to clean the surgery between patients to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus. NHS data shows 19 million fewer treatments - which includes both appointments for emergency treatment and check-ups - were offered in England between March and October in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. And during September and October, dental practices were operating at just one-third of last year's level. The BDA has warned that the reduction in the number of patients seen, paired with the closing of dentists, could have a dramatic impact on patients' oral health. The group sent a questionnaire to all 12,000 owners of NHS and private dental practices. Of the 1,337 who responded, 740 said they would not be financially viable a year from now unless they were given extra support. It has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock warning that, without government intervention, the country risks ""an oral health crisis"". Tim Miller, 50, had a fractured tooth which became an abscess that went behind his eye, damaging his eyesight. ""It felt like acid was being poured in my eye. That was the start of about eight and a half months of discomfort and pain as I tried to find an NHS dentist."" ""I must have tried about 10. When eventually I located one - the best advice they could come up with was can you go private?"" ""I did have some incredibly dark thoughts. I got to the point where I wanted it to stop and there wasn't much I wouldn't have done to make it stop."" Tim, who is on benefits, is not signed up with an NHS dentist. He only managed to afford private treatment after several of his friends chipped in to pay the bill. His tooth was taken out and his infection is now receding - but he is waiting to find out if he may have permanent damage to his eyesight. Christina Chatfield, who owns the Dental Health Spa in Brighton, where Tim was treated, says she has taken on £100,000 worth of debt to keep her practice open. But she says: ""The real problem is for those who don't get care. Problems will exacerbate. Kids will have more root canals which aren't available on the NHS. That means more extractions and more orthodontics. ""And without check ups we will be missing mouth cancers - normally nationally we spot 22 cases per day."" The BDA poll found 70% of the practices who responded were operating at less than half their pre-pandemic capacity. Sam Shah, group clinical director for East Village Dental, a group of six practices in the south of England, said: ""At least two of my surgeries, both in deprived communities with high levels of need, are at risk of closing within the next 12 months if the government doesn't intervene. ""The communities have a lack of access to any other NHS dental services."" Mr Shah added: ""We've seen an increase in the number of people using painkillers to manage dental pain - and that has led to an increase in the number of people presenting at A&E after inadvertently overdosing on paracetamol or ibuprofen."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The NHS is working hard to resume the routine elective services that were paused as part of the response to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. ""All dentists are able to remain open to patients and those holding NHS contracts have continued to be paid in full throughout the pandemic. ""Priority access is expected to be given to urgent care and vulnerable groups, with over 600 urgent dental centres continuing to provide extra support to the dental sector.""","Dentists have provided around 19m fewer treatments in England since March this year compared to the same period last year, figures show."
"The move reverses a decision made in 2012 by then-Home Secretary Theresa May that forced overseas students to leave four months after finishing a degree. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the change would see students ""unlock their potential"" and begin careers in the UK. But campaign group Migration Watch called it a ""retrograde"" step. The change will apply to international students in the UK - there were around 450,000 last year - who start courses at undergraduate level or above from next year onwards. They must be studying at an institution with a track record in upholding immigration checks. Under the proposals, there is no restriction on the kinds of jobs students would have to seek and no cap on numbers. ""If one needed evidence of a new approach to immigration within government, today's announcement allowing all foreign students to stay for two years after graduation is just that,"" the BBC's home editor Mark Easton said. ""Where Theresa May introduced what she called a hostile environment around migration rules, with an ambition to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, Boris Johnson has promised to scrap that target and encourage the brightest and best to come and live and work in global Britain."" 'To hell and back' Student Shreya Swamy, from India, says the proposal is ""a great step forward"" but it is ""a sad day"" for her as it has come too late to help students already in the UK. She has just finished studying for a master's degree at the University for the Creative Arts, in Kent and Surrey, and says she has ""struggled so much"" with the current rule giving her up to four months to look for work. Jobs for international graduates ""are close to nil"", she says, blaming their lack of experience. ""I have been through hell and back trying to figure out my career plan these past few months because it seems practically impossible to have one in the UK,"" she says. ""I feel really helpless, and almost regret coming here to study because I'm going to end up going back home with a very expensive piece of paper."" Read more here Chancellor Sajid Javid tweeted that the move was ""about time"", adding that the government ""should have reversed this silly policy years ago"". Former universities minister Jo Johnson - who quit his brother's government last week - tweeted that it was ""success at last"" after being involved in the cross-party campaign. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the decision, saying it would benefit the UK economy and reinstate the UK as a ""first choice study destination"". ""Evidence shows that international students bring significant positive social outcomes to the UK as well as £26bn in economic contributions, but for too long the lack of post-study work opportunities in the UK has put us at a competitive disadvantage in attracting those students,"" he said. But Alp Mehmet, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the decision was an ""unwise"" step that would ""likely lead to foreign graduates staying on to stack shelves"". ""Our universities are attracting a record number of overseas students so there is no need to devalue a study visa by turning it into a backdoor route for working here,"" he added. Others suggested that the overhaul of the rules should come in sooner so students who are due to graduate next year could be eligible for the visa. Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers, said there was ""ample time"" for the new rules to be implemented for those who finish their studies in 2020. How many international students stay in the UK? By BBC Reality Check team Just over 450,000 international students are currently studying in UK universities. Of these, almost two-thirds are from outside the EU, so will require a student visa to be in the country. Between about 170,000 and 185,000 of these students graduate each year and, under current rules, they have four months to transfer to another visa - such as a work visa - or decide to continue studying. In 2018, 6,300 individuals moved from student visas to skilled work visas, meaning they have officially been offered a job paying at least £20,800 in the first year. A further 450 were granted ""high-value migrant"" visas, which are normally reserved for those with particular expertise in a field or those who have a set sum of money to invest in the country. We also know that almost 40,000 student visas are extended each year, implying that a large number of graduates are continuing studies in the UK. That still leaves more than 100,000 students not formally extending their visas - and we don't have complete figures for how many of them leave the UK. However, analysis of exit checks by the Office of National Statistics suggests that 97% of them were leaving on time. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Labour has always said graduates should be able to work here after their studies. ""It enables them to contribute to our economy, our universities and to research, and helps us to attract the brightest and best from around the world. ""It is a great pity that ministers have previously supported measures that did the opposite."" 'International collaboration' The government's announcement coincides with the launch of a £200m genetics project at the UK Biobank, a charity and health resource that contains information and samples from 500,000 people. The UK Biobank collected DNA samples and health questionnaire information from 500,000 British volunteers over several years and is now open to researchers from anywhere in the world who want to use those resources to develop new treatments for diseases. The prime minister said projects of this kind wouldn't be possible ""without being open to the brightest and the best from across the globe to study and work"" in the UK. Mr Johnson said: ""That's why we're unveiling a new route for international students to unlock their potential and start their careers in the UK."" Britain had a ""proud history"" of being at the centre of international collaboration, he said, adding that it was ""bringing together experts from around the globe to work in the UK on the world's largest genetics research project"".","International students will be allowed to stay in the UK for two years after graduation to find a job, under new proposals announced by the Home Office."
"Around 70 people attended a public meeting in Llanwddyn to discuss Severn Trent Water's sale of 23,000 acre (93 sq km) land around Lake Vyrnwy. There were calls for water utility to give 10% of any sale to the community. Severn Trent has said a responsible transfer should bring benefits to those living and working on the estate. The land around Lake Vyrnwy is being split up into four lots, which are being sold on a 125-year lease. Estate agents say they expect a healthy interest. The land being sold includes farms, nature reserves and even people's homes. But some people living and working in the area say they are worried. The house of postmistress Audrey Jones is one of those up for sale with the estate. She said there was is only one topic of conversation in the village at the moment. She said: ""Nobody knows what's happening, do they? ""I had meeting with them. I was just told that it wouldn't make any odds to me because I rent my house and I'm not on a short lease. ""But you don't know who buys it, do you?"" Clerk to the community council, Gwyndaf Richards, said: ""There's an element of anxiety, obviously. ""Most of the people in this community area are affected by how Severn Trent is managed because they are the only owners in this area. ""There are quite a number of people who rent farms here and rent residential properties and they wondering about the level of rent the new owners require."" However, he said the sale also presented ""possible opportunities here"" as Severn Trent would still have in interest due to the land sale being on a lease. An online campaign has been launched with the aim of a million people buying £10 shares of the estate to ensure public access. The largest parcel of land for sale includes 12,000 acres (4,850 hectares) farmed jointly with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Other sections include 14 farms, a 5,000-acre (2,000 hectares) area of woodland managed by Forestry Commission Wales, and 31 residential and commercial properties. Water rights for the lake will be subject to separate negotiation. The water is used to serve United Utilities customers on Merseyside.",Concerns have been raised about what the sale of an £11m rural estate in Powys could mean for tenants.
"The firm has been under investigation for years over possible violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. However, no deal has been reached with the US government and Avon said it had provisionally set aside the money in the event of a settlement. Shares of the loss-making firm fell by more than 3% in US trade on Thursday. The world's largest direct seller of beauty products has also been struggling with slowing growth in many of its major markets. The company reported a net loss of $69.1m in the three months to December, while revenue fell by 10% to $2.67bn. Avon chief executive officer Sheri McCoy said the company was ""making headway"" towards returning to profit. ""Looking back at 2013, we made progress addressing tough legacy issues, identifying and beginning to resolve operational challenges, and rebuilding our management team,"" she said in a statement. ""While much work remains to be done, we continue to make progress toward building a better, simpler and more stable business."" Ms McCoy took the helm of the company in 2012 and has undertaken an aggressive cost-cutting plan. Last December, Avon announced plans to cut 650 jobs. It is also exiting unprofitable markets, including Vietnam and South Korea. However, Avon still has had to contend with rising competition, a lack of sales staff and problems with its technology systems. China probe Avon is one of the world's largest beauty companies and sells most of its products through direct selling by self-employed representatives who visit customers in their homes. Soon after China lifted its ban on direct selling in 2006, Avon obtained a license to do business there. But in mid-2008, Avon launched an internal investigation over allegations of improper payments in China. Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, companies are banned from paying money or giving anything of value to foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The US government inquiry - led by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice - began in 2011. According to a company filing, Avon had offered to settle the matter last year for $12m, which was rejected by US regulators. Avon said ""there can be no assurance"" it will be able to reach a settlement with the government, and if successful ""what the timing or terms of such settlements will be"". The company has racked up more than $300m in legal and other related costs due to the probe.",US cosmetics group Avon Products may spend up to $132m (£79m) to resolve allegations it may have bribed officials in China and other countries.
"Once participants are selected, the assembly will meet next year, with the outcome of their discussions reported back to Parliament. The initiative, set up by cross party MPs, will look at what members of the public can do to reduce CO2. The UK government has committed to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, one of six select committees who commissioned the climate assembly, said a clear roadmap was needed to achieve this goal. ""Finding solutions which are equitable and have public support will be crucial,"" she said. ""Parliament needs to work with the people and with government to address the challenge of climate change."" Random selection The invitees to Climate Assembly UK have been selected at random from across the UK. From those who respond, 110 people will be chosen as a representative sample of the population. They will meet over four weekends from late January in Birmingham, and will discuss topics ranging from transport to household energy use. A citizens' assembly has been a key demand of the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, whose protests caused widespread disruption this year. The group said they welcomed this as a first step, but warned that the assembly should be focussing on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 not 2050. Spokesperson Linda Doyle said: ""Waiting 30 years to reach zero net carbon emissions is a death sentence to people around the world and in the UK - it gives us a higher chance of breaching irreversible tipping points as the climate breaks down and it only serves short term 'business as usual'."" Complex issues Environmental group Friends of the Earth said citizens' assemblies could play an important part in policy-making. Dave Timms, head of political affairs at FOE, said: ""Tackling the climate emergency with the speed required will require radical changes to our economy, infrastructure and even to society so it's important that there is a consensus among citizens. ""Much of what needs to be done already commands widespread public support and it is politicians that just need to bloody-well get on with it now."" Citizens' assemblies have been used in a number of countries around the world. In Ireland, a panel of 99 people was established in 2016 to look at a range of political questions, including abortion. They recommended that the country should overturn its ban and suggested a referendum, which went on to support repeal. In Canada and the Netherlands, the approach has been used to discuss electoral reform.","Letters are being sent to 30,000 households across the UK inviting people to join a citizens' assembly on climate change."

"The Ontario Special Investigations Unit (SIU) said it was releasing his name due ""to the exceptional circumstances of this tragic incident"". A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city. Thirteen others were injured in the rampage in Canada's largest city. The SIU, which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, said a post-mortem examination on the suspected shooter is scheduled for Tuesday. According to the SIU, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street during the shooting, which happened on Sunday evening shortly after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday). ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. In a statement released to various media outlets, Hussain's family expressed their ""deepest condolences"" to the victims and their families for what they called ""our son's horrific actions"". ​ They said their son suffered from serious mental health challenges and had struggled with untreatable psychosis and depression most of his life. ""Our hearts are in pieces for the victims and for our city as we all come to grips with this terrible tragedy,"" they said. Who are the victims? The first victim to be identified was Reese Fallon, 18. Local member of Parliament, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, confirmed that she was one of the two killed in the shooting. Mr Erskine Smith told media that the family was ""devastated"" and was asking for privacy at this time. ""She was a local young Liberal, smart, passionate and full of energy,"" the Liberal MP told the BBC in a statement. ""It is a huge loss."" Ms Fallon was a recent high school graduate and, in a statement, the Toronto District School Board said they were ""heartbroken"" by the news. The school board said she ""was highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends"". According to her Facebook profile, she was about to begin studying at McMaster University. On Tuesday, police released the identity of the 10-year-old victim: Julianna Kozis of Markham. What happened in Toronto? Emergency services were called out just after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday) to the Greektown district of Toronto, a busy avenue known for its restaurants and summertime patios. Witnesses described hearing volleys of shots as people tried to run from the gunfire. Police say eight women and seven men were shot, ranging in age from 10 to 59. Det Sgt Terry Browne, who is leading the investigation into the shootings, told reporters on Monday that ""some individuals have what may be described as life-changing injuries"" following the attack. Police have said it is still too early to speculate as to a motive. Is Toronto known for gun violence? Gun violence is much rarer in Canada than over the border in the US, but Toronto has seen attacks increase dramatically in recent years. Shootings in the city over a holiday weekend earlier this month led to Mayor John Tory saying he was working to get more police patrolling the streets. The city leader acknowledged on Monday that Toronto has a firearms problem. ""The gun violence in any part of our city is horrible and completely unacceptable,"" Mayor Tory said. Police data also shows the number of shootings in Toronto more than doubled between 2014 and 2017 - from 177 to 395. Mr Trudeau's ruling Liberal party wants tougher background checks, including screening people with a history of violence.

As Exxon CEO Mr Tillerson has had business ties with Russia's leadership and is said to have a good relationship with President Vladimir Putin. He has criticised sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea. In an interview Fox News Sunday, Mr Trump praised Mr Tillerson, saying: ""He's a world-class player. He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of its next nearest competitor."" Mr Trump added that Mr Tillerson knows many of the players and he knows them well.

Republican Senator John McCain expressed ""concern"" about Mr Tillerson's potential links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the senator called ""a thug, a bully and a murderer"", during an interview with Fox News on Saturday. However, speaking on to CBS on Sunday, he said the Senate would give Mr Tillerson a ""fair hearing"" should he be selected by Mr Trump. Mr Tillerson is likely to be named America's top diplomat next week. NBC News reports that ex-US ambassador to the UN John Bolton may serve as his deputy. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani withdrew himself from consideration for the post last week. Under scrutiny: Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington This is the latest twist in Donald Trump's weeks-long search for a top diplomat: he has been considering close to a dozen candidates with significantly different views and backgrounds. Transition officials say he has finally settled on Rex Tillerson although there has been no official announcement. The long-time oil executive does not have any diplomatic experience but he has done business with many foreign governments, including in Russia where he has developed a good relationship with President Vladimir Putin. That is one reason his nomination would be closely scrutinised by lawmakers - especially in the wake of intelligence assessments that Russian hackers acted covertly to promote Mr Trump's campaign.","US President-elect Donald Trump has praised Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, amid growing reports he is going to appoint him secretary of state."
"Rose Jimmychen was 29 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to Scunthorpe General Hospital in early December. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she said she feared the worst before she underwent an emergency caesarean. Ms Jimmychen said she and her daughter were now both doing well and she wanted to say ""a big thank you"" to staff. Baby Catherine was born on 9 December weighing just 2lbs 6oz. ""I never thought she was going to survive because I knew I was not well and I might not make it,"" Ms Jimmychen said. ""Because of the situation, my family could not come in and I thought I'm never going to see them again."" However, after several weeks of treatment, mother and daughter are now back at home in Scunthorpe with husband George and Catherine's three older brothers. Thanking staff at the hospital, Ms Jimmychen told them: ""You are doing an amazing job."" Zoe Huteson, critical care matron at the hospital, said it had been a very difficult time for everyone involved. She said doctors had intervened in order to allow for Rose to receive treatment for Covid, including medicines not suitable for pregnant women. ""It's just such a nice feeling to see such a positive outcome,"" she said. Swapna Mathew, a friend and colleague, said Ms Jimmychen was well aware of what could happen as she had transferred from her normal role as a theatre nurse to work on the Covid wards during the second wave of the pandemic. ""She was really poorly and we didn't know what might be the outcome. Thankfully, it turned out to be a really good one,"" she said.

"Hayden Brown is charged with driving a Ford Focus into PC Thomas Dorman and PC Wai-man Lam, in Maidenhead. The crash also flung a passenger out of the car and pinned her underneath it, Reading Crown Court heard. Mr Brown, 25 and of Maidenhead, denies three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, in 2018. Michael Roques, prosecuting, said Mr Brown had been driving a group of people from a party to buy more alcohol and nitrous oxide balloons. 'Residents saved officer's life' He crashed the car into the officers who seconds before, had pulled over a taxi for speeding, in Norden Road on 2 September, the court heard. ""The defendant had lost control of the vehicle. It slid straight into the two police officers,"" Mr Roques said. ""They simply did not have enough time to react and get out the way. ""One witness described them being thrown into the air like ragdolls."" The car then hit the taxi, before spinning into the police car behind and flipping on its side, he said. The jury heard PC Dorman had to direct residents to find a tourniquet to stop him dying from blood loss at the scene, after suffering catastrophic leg injuries. 'Hiding in bush' Surgery he underwent later was unsuccessful in saving his leg. PC Lam required stitches for less serious leg wounds, but has since been unable to return to frontline duties at Thames Valley Police after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Focus passenger Annie Butt, suffered 24 separate broken bones in the crash, the hearing was told. Charlie Keeley and Mr Brown's brother, Stuart, were also in the car. Mr Roques told the court Mr Brown fled the scene before being found hiding in a bush. Giving evidence, Ms Butt said she had initially driven the car from the party to a Sainsbury's Local in Maidenhead because she had not drunk much, despite being under the influence of cocaine and cannabis. She said Mr Brown then took over driving when they left the supermarket, shortly before the crash. 'Shouting in agony' ""Hayden drove the car underneath the bridge and he lost control,"" Ms Butt told the jury. Written statements from PC Lam were read to the court, in which he described the moments before the vehicle struck. ""All of a sudden I heard the sound of an engine roar and could hear squealing and a screech from the direction of the bridge,"" he said. ""PC Dorman was shouting and rolling around in agony."" The trial continues.","A man has been accused of throwing two police officers ""into the air like ragdolls"" when he drove into them, leading one to have his leg amputated."
"By Dr Ricardo Twumasi & Prof Sukhi ShergillKing's College London We are motivated to take these risks by the release of dopamine. This feel-good chemical activates the same pleasurable reward pathways in our brains as eating our favourite food, or having sex. Risk-taking can help to advance the human race when it leads to entrepreneurship, innovation and enhanced creativity. But problems can arise when an increased desire to take risks causes harm. This includes problem gambling, which is estimated to affect as many as 1% of the population. Recent attempts to tackle the issue include plans to ban internet betting with credit cards and making treatment more widely available. Who is most likely to have a gambling problem? Extreme gambling is recognised as a disorder by the World Health Organization. Most people can enjoy placing an occasional bet, even if it means they lose some money. But some become problem gamblers, where the activity disrupts or compromises their lives and those of their families. In 2016, the Gambling Commission estimated there were up to 340,000 problem gamblers in the UK, with many more individuals at risk. Their report suggested problem gamblers were: In the year to March 2019, UK gamblers collectively lost about £14.4bn. Signs that somebody may have a problem include feelings of anxiety or stress around their gambling habit, betting more than they can afford to lose, and gambling ever larger amounts of money to feel the same ""high"" as before. The number of gambling-related hospital admissions in England has more than doubled in the last six years to a record high. This includes people whose gambling could lead them to carry out crimes, and cases of psychosis. There are now plans to open 14 more problem gambling clinics by 2023-24. £14.4bnwas collectively lost by UK gamblers in year to March 2019 £2maximum bet on fixed odds betting terminals, cut from £100 340,000people are thought to be problem gamblers in the UK 114%rise in gambling-related hospital cases in six years Why do some people have a problem? Gambling, alongside the use of substances like drugs and alcohol and even activities like shopping, can become an addiction when its use becomes compulsive and spirals out of control. These addictions stem from two separate reward pathways in the brain that affect our behaviour - liking and wanting. Liking describes the spontaneous delight of eating a chocolate biscuit. Wanting is our desire to have one when we see a packet of chocolate biscuits in the supermarket. Wanting something motivates us - it makes us desire things and do them repeatedly. In essence, addiction can be simply viewed as rewiring of these reward systems. When people become addicted to gambling, or to drugs, these wanting and liking systems are no longer intertwined. The wanting remains constant, but the feeling of liking what we get is reduced. The addicted person needs to engage in more of the behaviour or the drug to get the same pleasure. Certain factors leave some people at greater risk of addiction. This can include having family members with addictions, or encountering high-level stress or adversity - experiences which relate to the way we are nurtured. Nature can also play a part. A study using brain scans suggests problem gamblers may have lower impulse-control than the general population. More like this: Gambling 24/7 Some steps have been taken to reduce the problems gambling can cause. In recent years, campaigns have focused on fixed odds betting terminals, with the maximum stake cut from £100 to £2. These machines have been described as the ""crack cocaine of gambling"" and had made it easy for users to lose a lot of money quickly. The focus is now shifting to online and mobile gambling, which allows people to gamble 24 hours a day - often with the possibility of setting up automatic bets. Extensive promotion of gambling on apps and betting websites includes sponsorship deals with famous sports players and teams supported by millions of people. Mobile gambling means individuals can easily lose large sums of money. There is also the risk of children using stolen details to gamble online, with one study suggesting two-fifths of 11-16 year-olds have gambled in the past year. There have also been claims that online data profiling is being used to target poorer people, who tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on gambling. One way to reduce the risks could be for problem gamblers to be recognised by the same algorithms used to offer rewards on gaming websites. Instead, they could be offered targeted support, and potentially have their access to these sites restricted. There are growing calls for gambling to be reframed as a public health issue, like smoking and physical inactivity, which also disproportionately affect poorer people. National campaigns about the dangers of gambling, similar to those used to combat obesity and smoking, could be launched, and the issue highlighted by health professionals, debt advisers and within the school curriculum. In the future, we may have to ask ourselves as a society whether the benefits of promoting gambling outweigh the harms.

She was found 24 days later under a bed at Michael Donovan's nearby home after a police operation costing £3.2m. Donovan and Shannon's mother Karen Matthews were later jailed for eight years for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. Smith will star as Julie, a member of a Dewsbury residents and tenants association supporting the search to find Shannon. ""The themes of faith and trust in human nature, and the way the whole community came together, really inspired me,"" said Smith. The programme plans to focus on the spirit and determination of a group of women who brought the community together to try to find Shannon, according to the BBC. 'Drugged, subdued and hidden' The abduction of Shannon is not to be portrayed in the film and Karen Matthews is not the central character. She disappeared after a swimming trip with her school on 19 February 2008. Twenty-four days later she was found alive under a bed in Batley Carr, less than a mile from her home. This is how events unfolded The trial at Leeds Crown Court heard her mother and Donovan kept Shannon ""drugged, subdued and hidden from the public"" so they could claim £50,000 in reward money.

"The company also said trading at its Next Directory online and catalogue operation had been difficult, due in part to poor stock availability. Between 26 October and 24 December, sales at its High Street shops fell 0.5%, but rose 2% at the Directory arm. Next, whose shares closed down 4.6%, lowered its full-year profit estimate. The company, which has more than 500 stores, says it now expects annual pre-tax profits to be about £817m. This is at the lower end of its previous guidance issued in October, when it predicted profits of between £810m and £845m. The retailer, which did not take part in some of the heavy discounting sales events at the end of last year, said in a statement: ""We believe that the disappointing performance in the fourth quarter was mainly down to the unusually warm weather in November and December."" The statement also pointed to ""mistakes and challenges"" faced by the business. ""Specifically, we believe that Next Directory's disappointing sales were compounded by poor stock availability from October onwards."" In addition, Next said that online retailing was becoming tougher as competition intensified. Nevertheless, the company said full-price sales for the year-to-date were 3.7% ahead of last year, just below the bottom end of Next's previous guidance of a 4%-6% rise. 'Tough market' Analysts said the figures, the first winter trading update from one of the big retailers, suggested other High Street firms may have struggled. Neil Saunders, from retail analysts Conlumino, tweeted: ""Next's lacklustre results do not bode well for the rest of the High Street; warm weather was the main source of its woes."" Maureen Hinton from retail consultancy Verdict told the BBC that the results indicated a ""very tough"" market. However, Phil Dorrell, a director at Retail Remedy, told the BBC that the figures were ""pretty positive"" for Next. He told BBC 5 live that after other retailers have released their Christmas sales figures, the view could be: ""Wow, Next did really well."" He expects Marks and Spencer to report a decline in sales for the Christmas period when it releases figures on Thursday.

"Christopher Gorman, 54, was found guilty of allowing the death of a puppy in his care and repeatedly striking dogs with a large piece of wood. The offences happened in June 2016, at his home in Plains, North Lanarkshire. The unlicensed pet shop owner's conviction follows a Scottish SPCA investigation. Gorman was found guilty of three charges under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act at a hearing in September. Piece of wood Airdrie Sheriff Court heard that on 3 June 2016, a witness heard a large pack of dogs barking aggressively in the rear garden of his home. The witness filmed Gorman repeatedly striking the dogs on the body with a piece of wood and then contacted the Scottish SPCA, which was granted permission to carry out a search of the premises. A large number of dogs were found in the garden with no form of segregation. The conditions were described as filthy, with large quantities of faecal matter over a significant area of the rear garden. During the search, two mastiff puppies were found lying beneath a radiator in a room next to the kitchen. One of the puppies was dead and the other had to be put down. A post-mortem examination concluded that one of them had died from canine parvovirus. 'Terrible suffering' Sara Shaw, head of the wildlife and environmental crime unit, said: ""This was a case of widespread and indiscriminate neglect and the dogs in Gorman's care were caused terrible and unnecessary suffering with Gorman failing to provide them with a suitable environment or adequate care. ""We expect the highest standards of commercial dog breeders and are committed to working with the Scottish SPCA and the police to ensure that those who do not meet these standards are held to account."" Gorman had been banned from keeping animals for 10 years at a court hearing relating to another case in July. He is also subject to a six-month restriction of liberty order relating to that case. An undercover Scottish SPCA Inspector said Gorman had a ""long history"" of maltreating dogs in his care. ""This case has highlighted his ongoing cruelty and we're delighted that he has been dealt with by the courts"", he said. ""The mastiff-type puppies were suffering from parvo virus which is an excruciatingly debilitating illness which can, in some cases, result in death. ""To not seek veterinary treatment for these pups despite their obvious distress shows Gorman's priorities lay entirely in the profit that could be gained from selling on puppies to naive new owners, rather than in the welfare of the dogs.""","A man who caused the unnecessary suffering of dogs in his care has been given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and a £2,600 fine."
"The group, which runs bus and rail services in the UK and has operations in North America, said revenues rose 4.5% to £2.9bn in the year to 30 April. Pre-tax profits were 2% higher at £180.7m.

It added: ""The market conditions are positive with a combination of a rising population, increasing road congestion, the cost of running a car and widespread concern for the natural environment providing good potential for increased bus usage across the UK."" The group's megabus.com business has continued to expand in the UK, mainland Europe and North America, where it has added new services in Florida and North and South Carolina. Stagecoach said it believed there was ""a large market for high-quality, good-value inter-city coach travel"". Rail operations The group's rail arm saw profits fall by 17% to £34.3m, but revenues lifted 4.2% to £1.2bn. Stagecoach said the division performed in line with expectations. The group's rail operations include South West Trains, Island Line and East Midlands Trains and it has a 49% shareholding in Virgin Rail, which runs the West Coast franchise. Stagecoach recently failed to secure the new Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern rail franchise, but this was offset by the award of a new West Coast franchise until 2017. The company said positive discussions were continuing with the Department for Transport with a view to agreeing franchise extensions or direct awards at South West Trains and East Midlands Trains.

""Across the group, we have a strong set of locally-managed businesses which are improving services for our customers, supporting the economy and communities, and adding value for our investors.""","Transport giant Stagecoach has reported increased revenues and profits, helped by a strong performance from its UK regional bus division."
"The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is investigating the cause of the flooding at Gleision drift mine at Cilybebyll. One theory is that the water may have collected in an older abandoned mine. Dr Eric Wade of the Open University said such mines should be drained before work is allowed nearby. He said that British mining safety legislation was among the most advanced in the world, but the work was still hazardous. ""Mining is in fact a dangerous occupation and perhaps you can't remove the danger entirely but you can try to ensure you minimise the risk,"" he told BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme. ""If you're going to work in these areas before you start your mine up you should attempt to dewater some of the old workings and this would give you another margin of safety."" David Seath, a consultant in mine management services and secretary of the Mining Institute of Scotland, said the Mining Act 1978 had called for a ""thorough examination"" of plans before encroaching anywhere near flooded workings. ""There's quite an extensive record of old mine workings,"" he said. ""Obviously you can't go back to the beginning of mining in the UK because that goes back many many centuries. ""They would be working under a plan which they've got to have approved by the mine inspectorate. ""It would be discussed with representatives of the workers, with the HSE and the surveyor for the mine."" He added: ""I don't think that mining is so hazardous it should be eliminated completely."" Safety experts have promised that lessons will be learned following the incident on Thursday which left four men dead. The bodies recovered on Friday were identified as Garry Jenkins, David Powell, Phillip Hill and Charles Breslin. Three miners had managed to escape as flood water engulfed the mine's shaft when a retaining wall holding back a body of water underground failed. A spokesperson for the HSE said: ""A full report into the causes of the accident is to be published in due course to ensure that any lessons can be applied."" Speaking on Friday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said the colliery had been well-regulated. ""As far as this mine is concerned it was inspected last year and the plans were up to date in June."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""There is an ongoing police and HSE investigation into the terrible tragedy that occurred at Gleision colliery last week. ""We have full confidence in both the HSE and the police as they carry out that investigation. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.""",A mining expert has called for a review of health and safety regulations following the tragedy which killed four men at a Swansea Valley mine.
"By Rebecca WoodsBBC News ""They are all just in it for themselves. I don't really see how my vote can change anything."" Mick Billington, Hanley town centre's postman, hasn't voted in years. ""The literature comes through my door from all the parties, but I don't read it. I just throw it in the bin,"" he says. Latest coverage on the 2017 general election ""I thought about voting in the referendum. The Mrs kept saying 'come on, we should go', but you know how it is, you get in from work and you're comfortable."" He is not alone. While many were moved to vote in the EU Referendum, Stoke Central's turnout at general elections has been falling steadily for 67 years - from a record high of 83% in 1950 to 51% in 2015, the lowest in the UK. This once-proud Labour heartland - the party has held the seat at every election since 1950 - is now home to an electorate that has become increasingly uninterested in politics. Mr Billington's indifference for voting is not reflected in his views of the NHS. His 86-year-old mother died six weeks ago, following a fall which saw her hospitalised for a fractured spine. She'd suffered with dementia and when he visited her in hospital, Mr Billington saw for himself the pressures staff were under. ""People were lining the corridors [in their beds]. We're in 2017, not the 1940s or 50s,"" he says, his voice teetering on the edge of exasperation. ""I was saying to my wife only last night, I'd be happy to pay an extra £1 a week to help the NHS."" It's a rainy day in Hanley, one of the six Potteries towns that were amalgamated into the city of Stoke-on-Trent in 1910. Over the years, it has become the city's main shopping centre, but it has suffered some decline as shops including Argos, JD Sports and much-loved independent bookshop Webberley's all closed. While Stoke-on-Trent City Council is part way through regeneration plans - a four-star Hilton hotel is planned for the growing new Smithfield site and a shopping complex is due to replace the old bus station - some feel not enough is being done to breathe new life into the town centre. As lunchtime approaches, some streets in the centre are virtually empty of shoppers. Several units are boarded up. Carol Dugan works at JM Edwards tobacconist, opened by the late Tony Edwards in 1952. ""There's not enough done in Hanley to support us. Shops are boarded up but the council doesn't lower the rent to attract new ones in,"" she says. ""The druggies and the homeless have also become a really big problem."" A staunch Conservative, she chose not to follow her late father's own political beliefs. ""My dad was Labour. But he'd turn in his grave if he could see what was happening in the party now. ""I don't know why so many people don't vote. I vote because I'm a woman. Women died to give us the vote and we should use it."" Kevin Jones was a third generation Royal Doulton worker until he was made redundant when the china maker closed its last UK factory more than a decade ago. He now runs Oatie Mostons in Market Square, selling Staffordshire oatcakes from his van. ""I haven't voted for a few year,"" he says. ""After I was made redundant I became very disillusioned with things. They say the same things over and over but nothing ever changes."" Despite his apathy, Mr Jones felt strongly enough to vote to remain in the EU - something 69.4% of Stoke-on-Trent's voting population disagreed with. He is a floating voter and says he will probably take part in the forthcoming General Election. He likes Gareth Snell, who was elected to the Stoke-on-Trent Central seat over UKIP's Paul Nuttall in February's by-election. ""He's a people person. He comes into town and he talks to people,"" says Mr Jones. ""The Labour party should have more people like him and maybe they wouldn't have as many problems."" He also wouldn't mind paying more tax. ""I'd be prepared to pay more to pay for the right things,"" he adds. ""People are living longer - the money [to care for them] has got to come from somewhere. ""But I disagree in giving money to young people who haven't put anything in."" Mr Jones points to the pedestrian area outside his van, which is parked between Boots and Poundland. ""There are people begging here all the time. They come from outside Stoke - they know people here are generous. I've seen people give them £5 notes."" Stoke-on-Trent Central: Constituency profile Source: House of Commons Library Statistics Mr Jones talks of being told about families where three generations have never had jobs. ""It's a lifestyle choice for some, and it shouldn't be."" At the end of 2016, there was an estimated 17 rough sleepers a night on the streets of Stoke-on-Trent. Tackling homelessness is on the agenda for the three main political parties. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn plans to make 4,000 homes across the country available to the homeless, while Lib Dem boss Tim Farron wants to introduce a policy that will place long-term rough sleepers straight into independent homes rather than emergency shelters. The Conservatives aim to eradicate rough sleeping by 2027, and want to set up a homeless reduction taskforce. For lifelong Labour supporter Janet Ellis, education is a top priority. ""Schools - I've got two young grandchildren, aged five and eight - and their education is very important,"" she says. ""These schools that have large classes and just one teacher in charge - how can that be good for them?"" She is in the town centre with her eldest grandson, Ethan Jenkins, having just given him a lift to an interview for an engineering apprenticeship. Aged 18, he's looking forward to being able to vote for the first time. ""I'm voting because I've got the right to. A lot of people my age were in uproar that we couldn't vote in the referendum,"" he says. ""One person in particular was very angry and he's campaigning to get the voting age lowered to 16."" He's decided to back Labour, but not because his grandmother is a lifelong supporter. ""I'm not very political at all, but I've read a lot about what Labour is standing for, such as getting rid of hospital parking charges,"" he says. ""My step-dad works in the NHS and we've been a few times when relatives have been in hospital and you're there fumbling about with change."" Wearing a black T-shirt with ""Too Glam to Give a Damn"" in bright pink letters makes Laura Cook stand out among the rain-soaked shoppers. Aged 23 and a manager at the Kurt Geiger concession in Debenhams, she and her partner have just bought a property. Despite her glittery message, pay is a big issue for her. ""Costs of things are starting to rise but our wages aren't. Everything [previously] stretched quite well but it's becoming harder,"" she says. ""I'm only 23 - owning a property is a big deal. I'm not poorly paid and I'm very fortunate. ""I've worked since I was 16 - I used to work at Alton Towers. ""But the cost of living is rising for everyone. I've had to work and work hard."" She's voted in elections ever since she turned 18. ""It's important. If you've got a vote you should use it. Plenty of people my age don't."" And plenty of people who aren't her age don't either. Whether or not more constituents in Stoke Central will be fired up enough to cast their vote on 8 June is yet to be seen.

"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent CAZ? LEZ? ULEZ? What do they all mean? These are all different ways of describing geographical areas of cities or towns that have placed restrictions on the use of vehicles, with the goal of tackling air pollution. A CAZ is a clean air zone, a LEZ is a low emissions zone. Now we have London with the world's first ULEZ, or ultra low emissions zone. In the UK, CAZs are areas that can decide to use charging as a means of cleaning the air, but don't have to. If they do impose some form of charging for the most polluting vehicles, they are called a LEZ. Across Europe there is less clarity about definitions, and LEZ is the term widely used to describe about 250 areas in different cities, with considerable variation. ""Not all LEZs have been created equal,"" said Yoann Le Petit from the research group Transport & Environment. ""In Brussels, in terms of coverage, it's quite a large LEZ, but in terms of ambition level, it's very low. It started last year, banning Euro 1 cars (registered before 1992). These are very old vehicles; you hardly see them on the street. ""You also have a very high ambition LEZ in Madrid and the one just introduced in Stuttgart, but there is no agreed definition of what an LEZ is."" Who's got the most restricted areas? Across Europe, Italy has the most low emissions zones - some of them permanent, many of them seasonal. There are also about 80 in Germany, and 14 each in the Netherlands and the UK. France has also 14 LEZs, but most of these are emergency schemes that are enforced on a daily basis when there are pollution peaks. What's happening in the rest of the world? There are initiatives under way across all continents. Some are more successful than others. Tokyo was one of the first cities to ban diesel vehicles, starting back in 2000. Seoul in South Korea only introduced measures in 2017 to ban diesel cars that failed to meet emissions standards. Bogota in Colombia has been working since 1974 to get cars off the streets. Every Sunday sees large numbers of roads closed until 2pm. They have also attempted to restrict cars based on number plates with less success. Mexico city has also developed restrictions based on number plates and by banning cars on Saturdays. However, a study from 2017 says that it hasn't worked as well as hoped because people car-pooled, used taxis or bought extra vehicles. In the US, San Francisco has plans to ban cars on Market Street, and Los Angeles, Denver and Charlotte are thinking about how to reduce emissions in the future. But no American city has yet banned diesel cars in any form. Surprising lessons from the world's oldest LEZ? One of the most curious things to come out of the introduction of a LEZ in Sweden in 1996 was the demand from trucking companies to make them bigger. ""Before the introduction, some hauliers were really angry about it,"" said Anders Roth, formerly the civil servant in charge of the Gothenburg LEZ. ""Then they realised it wasn't that bad and the big hauliers who invested in new vehicles realised they could make more money from having a good environmental profile, and they wanted the zone made bigger."" The world's first LEZs for vehicles were introduced in Gothenburg, Stockholm, Malmo and Lund in Sweden back in the mid 1990s. The restrictions put in place were targeted at the most polluting diesel trucks and buses in the city centre. Essentially, any vehicle over 3.5 tonnes. Private cars were not included; they're still not banned. ""The next step would be to include cars, but that's a more controversial question in Sweden. We already have congestion charging in Gothenburg and Stockholm, but politicians are reluctant to enforce more regulations,"" said Mr Roth. He believes that because the Swedish cities started earlier, they have had to place fewer restrictions on vehicles to achieve cleaner air. ""We started early and people got used to it and now it's normal - people would think it would be silly to take it away."" He's a supporter of the London ULEZ. ""I think that's the best way to go. You don't have to ban vehicles totally if they are not really bad; you can have the same effect but without the same high cost for society."" Do these restrictions make a big difference? Undoubtedly all the zones are having an impact - but the scale of the difference varies, depending on the type of pollutant. They've worked well with diesel particulates which the World Health Organization has linked to cancer. ""They have made a huge difference with all forms of particulate matter,"" said Lucy Sadler, who previously led the London Mayor's air quality team and now runs a website that collects information on how cities are tackling air pollution. ""Nitrous oxides (NOx) are harder, no thanks to vehicle manufacturers."" ""If you look at Milan, which has a low emissions zone and a congestion charge combined, they've reduced NOx by 10%, they reckon. That's huge in a city because there's not that many things you can affect. ""A low emissions zone won't be a single magic wand, but it can usually be the biggest single measure."" Is London's new zone really the ""toughest"" in the world? It's very hard to say definitively as different cities have different levels of restriction. Certainly, it is one of the most ambitious among the world's largest cities. But some critics say that it could be tougher by banning polluting vehicles instead of just charging them. Some experts believe this is down to the level of authority in the mayor's hands. ""In London they have the power to charge for it; others have the right to ban,"" said Kate Laing from C40 Cities, a group of major world cities committed to tackling climate change. ""But if you are willing to drive and pay the charge three days a week instead of five days a week - that is still making gains in air quality."" Apart from London, two cities in Europe are said by observers to be the most restrictive. In Madrid, there is a zero emissions zone since last November, about the same size as the new London ULEZ. To drive into the Madrid zone, you have to have authorisation and that is only given to zero emissions vehicles such as electric cars. However, residents are given an exemption that they can continue to use their existing cars until they get a new one. It is more relaxed for residents, say experts, because it was introduced with much less lead time than London, ""Madrid is a small zone but it is very ambitious,"" said Yoann Le Petit. ""They could already see a NO2 reduction of around 40%. Even outside the LEZ, they saw a slight decrease in traffic, as people know they won't be able to go through the city centre. They even saw a slight increase in business in the zone."" Oslo also has very ambitious plans. The city has already removed 700 car parking spaces to create bike lanes and small parks. It also has a zero emissions zone in the centre of the city. Do local governments make money from these schemes? According to experts, low emissions zones don't make money. ""The more you enforce, the more expensive it gets,"" said Lucy Sadler. ""If you fine someone £40, it won't cover the cost to enforce it. They don't make money. It's a myth that some organisations like to promote, but it's absolutely not based on fact. ""Combined congestion charging is different. Across Europe, London is best-practice as the money raised is spent on local public transport. In other countries, it's not the case."" Where do we go from ULEZ? To zero, most likely. The direction of travel is to increase the size of low-emissions zones, and then, over time, to go to zero emissions. This means that only electric cars, or vehicles powered by battery or hydrogen, for example, would be allowed in. ""Zero is a big step from low. It will require serious investment in electric vehicles and hydrogen, and shifts towards more walking, cycling and public transport,"" said Kate Laing from C40 Cities. ""In London, the Mayor's transport strategy is to try to achieve 80% of trips across London in walking, cycling and mass transport by 2040; the ULEZ is feeding into a long-term vision of the city by 2040."" This thrust is not just because of air quality; it's also down to climate change. Emissions from transport are proving very tough to curb, and will require continued restrictions on internal combustion engines. ""Increasing numbers of cities are saying zero emissions zones,"" said Lucy Sadler. ""In terms of where we are going - this is the final destination,"" said Yoann Le Petit. Follow Matt on Twitter.","London's tough new Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) is the latest - and one of the strongest - steps yet taken to limit emissions of pollutants from cars, vans and trucks. So how does it compare with measures taken in other cities in Europe and the rest of the world?"

"The statue of Nancy Astor, who was a Plymouth MP from 1919 to 1945, was unveiled by former prime minister Theresa May on Plymouth Hoe in 2019. The graffiti was discovered on Tuesday. Campaigners have accused Lady Astor of being anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic and a Nazi sympathiser, but supporters say she was a victim of misogyny and was ""opposed to Nazism"". The statue was installed after £125,000 was raised through crowdfunding by the Nancy Astor Statue Appeal. Lady Astor argued for the rights of women and successfully saw the female voting age lowered from 30 to 21 in 1928. The statue of Sir Francis Drake in Plymouth has also been attacked over his connections to slavery. Both statues are listed by campaigners Topple the Racists which is demanding the removal of monuments that ""celebrate slavery and racism"". Prof Judith Rowbotham, from the University of Plymouth, said Lady Astor was ""never a supporter of Nazism"" and led a conference in 1933 which criticised Nazi policy on women. ""She was one of many people at the time who hoped to avoid war because women and children always suffer most in war,"" she said. Prof Rowbotham said claims of anti-Semitism were ""unfounded"" and ""more to do with misogyny and ignorance than reality"".",A statue commemorating the first woman MP to take her seat in Parliament has been daubed with the words Nazi.
"By Taylor Kate BrownBBC News, Washington The downpour continued for more than 72 hours, leading to widespread and dramatic flooding in the affected area and downstream along the Amite river. Louisiana has seen four times the average amount of rainfall for August. ""What made this so disastrous is the large area,"" says Ken Graham, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service's New Orleans/Baton Rouge office. Graham says much of the eastern portion of the state, from the northern Mississippi border all the way to the Gulf of Mexico saw rainfall of at least 15in over 48 hours. That's about 11,000 sq miles, about twice the size of Connecticut. ""Normally you would see some small pockets with these kinds of rainfall totals, but this is the largest area of this kind of rainfall I've seen in my career."" The result has been devastating. At least 13 people have died and more than 40,000 homes have been damaged. Towns along the Amite river have experienced some of the worst flooding. In Denham Springs, the river topped at more than 46ft, some 4ft higher than its previous record in 1983. In one parish east of Baton Rouge, officials believe 75% of the homes had been damaged, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has made disaster declaration in 20 of the state's 64 parishes. More than 86,500 people have registered for assistance from the agency. Dramatic video footage has emerged from the region, picturing people being rescued from houses and sinking cars. State officials estimate about 30,000 people have been rescued. Others have not been so lucky. According to the New York Times, a number of people have died after being swept away by surging rivers. For the state of Louisiana, the storm is among the worst in the state's history. Graham said there had been major flooding from storms in 1983 and 1995. ""We talk about these as benchmarks - but this one beat them all."" Thousands of members of the US National Guard have been deployed in the region to assist with search-and-rescue operations. The Red Cross has said it is launching its largest relief effort in America since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In the four years since Sandy, other major disasters in the US have included, among others: A local Baton Rouge paper has criticised President Obama for not visiting the affected area, but he said on Friday he would visit the following week. On Tuesday Governor Bel Edwards made a comment that while federal agencies have been responsive, the flooding had not received as much attention as some of the major hurricanes that have hit the area. ""When you have a storm that is unnamed - it wasn't a tropical storm, it wasn't a hurricane - a lot of times people underestimate the impact that it would have,"" Mr Edwards said, calling the flooding ""historic"" and ""unprecedented"". Additional reporting and production by Charlie Northcott","Days of heavy rain have caused historic flooding in the US state of Louisiana, br inging as much as 31in (79cm) across a third of the state ."
"The complaint alleged a conflict of interest when presenter Simon Mayo and news correspondent Mark Easton were guests on consecutive shows in February last year to talk about their books. It suggested a pattern of BBC personnel being given ""promo"" slots on the show. But the trust said no guidelines were breached by either of the appearances. In its ruling, the trust said Bacon's show was ""a mix of news, sport, entertainment and interviews with guests,"" adding it ""frequently features interviews with authors who have recently had books published"". Mayo, who presents a drive time show on Radio 2, is a former regular 5 live host and still reviews films on the network. He was on the Bacon show to talk about his children's book, Itch, which was published on 1 March 2012. Easton, currently the BBC's Home Editor, talked about his book, Britain etc, which was also published last March. The complainant had said both interviewees were favoured because of their existing connections to the BBC and alleged there was a pattern of corporation staff being over-represented as guests on BBC shows. But the trust report said there had been ""no impropriety in the way the interviews had been arranged (either by the publishers, Mr Easton or Mr Mayo) and there was no evidence that either Mr Mayo or Mr Easton had lobbied to get on the show to promote their books or otherwise asked for favours"". It added the two BBC guests had ""broadly been treated as other guests would have been and the books had not been given undue prominence"". However, it agreed the importance of editorial guidelines being adhered to in relation to such interviews. Six Nations complaint The Trust also answered a complaint from the trade body for commercial radio companies in the UK about the presence of an on-screen animated graphic for the 2012 Six Nations rugby championship's data supplier Accenture during live matches. The RadioCentre complaint said the graphic was unduly prominent and amounted to sponsorship. In its ruling the trust said that to give Accenture on-screen credits as data-supplier was ""appropriate and editorially justified"" and that Accenture's contractual relationship was with the tournament organiser and not the BBC. It added ""no question of programme sponsorship arose"". However, the report took issue with an email sent by the an executive producer to staff, which might have given recipients the impression that BBC Sport had made a binding commitment over how often and for how long Accenture's logo was should be featured. The trust said this meant that audiences ""could not have a well-founded confidence"" that the corporation's decisions on the sponsorship ""were not influenced by commercial pressures"". As such the complaint was partially upheld. The editorial standards committee recommended that in future, it should be made clear the BBC had not entered into any binding commitments on ""supplier credits"" and any specifications on the use of logos are ""merely an indication of what BBC Sport considered likely to be appropriate"".",A complaint about books written by BBC employees being given undue prominence on Richard Bacon's 5 live show has not been upheld by the BBC Trust.

"By Almeena AhmedInnovators, Pakistan Zymal Umer, 10, sighs as she takes in the view of a makeshift rubbish dump on the outskirts of her hometown Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan. But could the girl dubbed the country's ""youngest social entrepreneur"" by many have a solution? For now, there are colourful piles of plastic bags, metal and general waste as far as the eye can see. Wafts of smoke fill the air with a putrid and toxic stench as much of the refuse is set on fire. What's in front of Zymal is just the tip of the iceberg that is Pakistan's problem with waste. According to the country's environment protection department, 20m tonnes of solid waste is generated a year and the figure is growing by 2.4% annually. Landfill issues ""This is a situation you can find across all of Pakistan - these bags are not biodegradable and people carelessly discard them. They don't really think about recycling,"" Zymal says. Proper solid waste management has never been practised in the country; only half of the rubbish generated is collected by the government and there is a severe lack of adequate landfill sites. Dumping and burning remain the most common methods of disposal and much of the uncollected waste poses serious risks to public health. Beautiful bags Zeebags is Zymal's bid to try to reduce pollution and increase awareness about the environment. The schoolgirl turns old newspapers into bright and beautifully decorated gift bags which are then sold to family and friends and most of the profits distributed to various local charities. In the space of just three years she has gone from selling a few bags to selling hundreds - worth $4-5,000. ""I learnt to make the bags by watching YouTube. ""It is hard to balance my schoolwork with running Zeebags, so I make them at the weekend or during the holidays with my cousins. ""My father and grandfather pay for my raw materials and if they didn't help me, it would be very hard to keep my project going,"" she says. One charity Zymal's money goes to is called SOS Children's Villages, which helps orphaned and destitute children across Pakistan. ""Through my income I've been able to pay for water coolers, washing machines, batteries and the type of things they need for daily life,"" Zymal explains. ""To see the happiness on their faces gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to carry on."" Her innovative and charitable enterprise has attracted a fair bit of attention with TV and newspaper coverage labelling Zymal as ""Pakistan's youngest social entrepreneur"". Award winner Zeebags has also won a number of awards in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA. ""I was very excited to get some international recognition for my work and proud to get some positive exposure for my country and parents."" Selling online has opened up her business to a new world of possibilities. ""In Pakistan it's thought girls cannot work independently but I haven't faced any difficulties and my aim is to continue my work. ""I want to become a businesswoman in the future and expand Zeebags through my website and showcase other people's products, too.""

Kalsoom Lakhani is founder of Invest2Innovate, an organisation that helps start-up companies in Pakistan grow and attract funding. She says the country needs to think about the future for entrepreneurs. ""While we have this enormous potential we need to be always thinking, how we enable that potential and how we continue to not only allow young people to start a business but allow them to grow businesses."" Pakistan has already begun to tackle its environmental problems through legislation, establishing government agencies and accepting technical help from international donors. But the response is still fragmented and not a particularly high priority in a country racked with more pressing security and political issues. This gives Zymal's work even more urgency. She hopes her success will start to change people's minds about the seriousness of taking care of their environment. ""It is important so future generations can live in a clean and safe world,"" she says. ""I want to be able to say I've played my part but it's up to others to do something themselves, too.""","""If people just thought for a moment before dumping their rubbish then maybe they wouldn't do it as it harms our environment."""
"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital was criticised when 15 ambulances had to queue outside A&E on Easter Monday. Some patients were also kept waiting for treatment inside the department for more than three hours. Chief executive Anna Dugdale said 30% more patients than expected had arrived but A&E had now been reorganised. The East of England Ambulance Service set up a treatment tent outside over Easter as part of a contingency plan. It was put up as a precaution but in the end was not used, the service said. The hospital said there had been a sudden rise in the number of seriously ill patients and a similar surge in demand had been experienced at hospitals across the region over the Easter weekend. Staff rise to challenge This May bank holiday more staff would be on duty and the hospital was recruiting further staff for accident and emergency duty, Ms Dugdale said. ""We are reorganising the department to deal with the ever increasing volumes of patients. ""Over the next few months we are also recruiting. People want care and they want it now. ""It's a testament to the A&E staff that they have dealt with the challenge but there are other services available especially for people who may not be so sick,"" she said. ""We have avoided a significant proportion of the fines over the service performance and have set out a detailed plan for dealing with ambulance handovers and delays in future."" Money on front line About £2.5m is to be spent by the trust on reducing delays in delivering and dealing with ambulance patients at the hospital. The money will pay for 20 new emergency department nurses and doctors. Krishna Sethia, medical director of the NNUH said the hospital was ""delighted"" at the additional funding. ""Our commitment is that this money will be spent on frontline clinical staff."" Systems are in place to track the arrival of patients so their treatment can be planned.",Increasing staff on duty at a Norfolk hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department could reduce significantly fines for underachieving at Easter.
"Mr Raab was drafted in as Brexit Secretary to replace David Davis, who quit in protest at the prime minister's proposals for post-Brexit trade. A special unit in Mrs May's office has played an increasing role in Brexit talks during recent months. Tuesday's announcement, in a written statement by Mrs May, formalises that shift in responsibility. Labour's Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said: ""Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the chance to get his feet under the table."" Mr Raab, who was a leading figure in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, insisted he had not been sidelined, telling MPs it had always been the case that Mrs May was in overall charge of the talks and the announcement amounted to some ""shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs"". He said the prime minister had suggested the changes to him on the day he was offered David Davis's job and he had agreed to them. He acknowledged there had previously been ""tensions"" between his department and the Cabinet Office and the changes would ensure there was ""one chain of command"" to ""get the best possible deal"". Stewart Jackson, who was chief of staff for David Davis before he resigned two weeks ago, has previously accused Number 10 of running a ""shadow, parallel operation"" and keeping officials and ministers from the Brexit department ""in the dark"" about Brexit proposals. The Europe Unit led by senior civil servant Olly Robbins in the Cabinet Office, which reports directly to the prime minister, will have ""overall responsibility for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations"", Mrs May said in her written statement. ""DExEU (the Department for Exiting the EU) will continue to lead on all of the government's preparations for Brexit: domestic preparations in both a deal and a no-deal scenario, all of the necessary legislation, and preparations for the negotiations to implement the detail of the Future Framework. ""I will lead the negotiations with the European Union, with the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union deputising on my behalf."" Mrs May said that DExEU would recruit some new staff to work on preparations for Brexit, while a number of Cabinet Office officials would move over to the department. There will be no net reduction to staff numbers in Mr Raab's department, she said. Mr Raab told MPs on the Brexit committee, he would be going back out to Brussels shortly to continue talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier, alongside Mr Robbins. Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay suggested a ""coup"" had taken place to take control of the Brexit process away from David Davis. Mr Robbins said: ""I honestly don't recognise the picture you are painting."" It comes as the government published a White Paper saying how the UK's EU withdrawal agreement will be put into law. Mr Raab said the proposed Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill would deliver a ""smooth and orderly"" Brexit. He said it would kick in only once MPs had given their backing to any deal struck with Brussels in the autumn. If there is no deal it will not be enacted. The legislation would amend some parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill, passed last month after a series of knife-edge votes, to ensure the UK statute book continues to function during the 21 month transition period. It would not end the supremacy of EU law altogether on 29 March next year, as promised in the EU Withdrawal Bill, with the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice until December 2020, among other things. Labour's Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was now clear that the EU Withdrawal Act ""will need major surgery,"" adding that the 29 March Brexit day was a ""gimmick"" which had come ""unstuck"". ""I can't remember legislation which has needed such great revision and amendment before the relevant parts have even come into force,"" he told MPs. The new bill would create a financial authority to manage ""divorce"" payments, which will total between £35bn and £39bn, to the EU - and aim to protect citizens' rights. Mr Raab told MPs: ""It provides the clarity and certainty to EU citizens living here and UK nationals abroad that their rights will be properly protected. ""It will enact a time-limited implementation period, giving businesses greater certainty, giving the public finality with respect to our relationship with the EU and it provides for the appropriate means for paying the financial settlement. ""Above all, with 80% of the withdrawal agreement settled with our EU friends, the white paper is another key milestone on the UK's path to leaving the EU."" He said the publication of the white paper will allow ""maximum scrutiny"" of the government's plans by Parliament. ""It also sends a clear signal to the European Union that the United Kingdom is a reliable, dependable negotiating partner, delivering on the commitments it has made across the negotiation table,"" he told MPs. In a separate development, the UK government guaranteed funding for EU programmes run by UK charities, businesses and universities up to the end of 2020, even if the UK left without a deal.","Theresa May is taking personal control of Brexit talks with the EU, with Dominic Raab deputising for her."
"In 2013/14, nearly 13,500 of the 24,806 referrals were because of alcohol, Welsh government figures have shown. Both figures are up on the previous year. Heroin and cannabis referrals are also up. Drug and alcohol charity Cais said it is ""astonishing"" minimum price is not already in place. ""Part of the answer for me is around the pricing strategy,"" said Clive Wolfendale, chief executive of the charity. ""It's long overdue and there's a huge weight of evidence that it can have an impact. People are stopping smoking because there's clear recognition of the health risks and because they have become so expensive. ""Some clients say they don't care how much it costs, they will get it. Someone with a long term problem will beg and steal. ""But we can dissuade the student binge drinkers of today from turning into tomorrow's addicts with higher prices and health education."" Mr Wolfendale acknowledged the Welsh government is planning to introduce minimum 50p per unit pricing but accepted there were European law ""issues"" around it along with the power drinks companies have. The figures show the biggest age group for alcohol problems is those aged between 30 and 49. He said pressures of life can turn these people to alcohol for a ""release"" but added the life experience can help them turn themselves around.","More than half of people referred for help with substance misuse in Wales have alcohol problems, prompting calls for a minimum pricing."
"Kengo Kuma saw the finished exterior for the first time during a visit to the city. Mr Kuma's design, which sees the building jutting over the River Tay, was inspired by the cliffs of Scotland's north-east coast. Construction of the building will be completed by the end of December. The museum, which has been under construction since March 2015, is due to open next summer. Mr Kuma said: ""The realisation of the strong façade is great. We were able to express the dynamic scale of the interior, too - just as we had planned."" The architect, who also designed the Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium, said his inspiration ""always starts"" in the country where the project will be. He said: ""In the past I visited Scotland many times, this very beautiful country, and I'm truly in love with the Scottish landscape and nature. ""I really hope, once finished, this project will attract many people from the UK, and around the world, to the city and the museum. ""I hope as well that people from Dundee will use it as an everyday part of their city; that they will go there to enjoy the building with its surrounding public space and find a harmonious relationship between the museum, the riverside, the city and themselves."" V&A Dundee director Philip Long said: ""It is a real pleasure to have the architect of V&A Dundee, Kengo Kuma, with us today to see the incredible progress that has been made in bringing his vision to life.

"UK-based Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) said all but one of the locations affected were in the US, with the other being in Puerto Rico. Guests have been warned they could have had money stolen as a consequence. One expert said there might be further hotels affected. Buckinghamshire-based IHG had previously reported in February that a dozen US hotels that it managed itself had been affected by the same attack. ""Individuals should closely monitor their payment card account statements,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC following the latest discovery. ""If there are unauthorised charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank. ""Payment card network rules generally state that cardholders are not responsible for such charges."" Other affected brands include Hotel Indigo and Candlewood Suites. Hijacked card data IHG said an investigation had detected signs the malware had been active at front-desk payment locations at the hotels between 29 September and 29 December 2016. However, it only has confirmation that the threat was definitely eradicated last month. The attack hijacked information taken from the payment cards' magnetic strips as it was being routed through the hotels' computer servers, said the hotel group. This could include the card number, expiration date and verification code. IHG does not believe other guest information was stolen. It has published a tool for visitors to check if hotels they stayed at are among those affected. The firm notes that other franchisees that had adopted an encryption-based security measure would not have been affected. But one cybersecurity expert said that the list might not be comprehensive. ""IHG has been offering its franchised properties a free examination by an outside computer forensic team,"" wrote Brian Krebs. ""But not all property owners have been anxious to take the company up on that offer. ""As a consequence, there may be more breached hotel locations yet to be added to the state look-up tool."" Other hotel chains to have been struck by payment system hacks in recent years include Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental and Trump Hotels. The US has been slower to switch to a chip-and-pin system than many other countries, which makes it more difficult to carry out such attacks.","The owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotel brands has disclosed that payment card-stealing malware has struck about 1,200 of its franchisees' properties."
"By Sima KotechaBBC Panorama Sara Khan told the BBC's Panorama more support should have been given to head teachers dealing with demonstrations. Ms Khan was appointed by the home secretary to lead the Commission for Countering Extremism. She said the Department for Education ""could have done so much more"". ""I think they were too slow to respond,"" said Ms Khan. ""There's a lot of confusion about what's actually being taught and I think the DfE could have played a very important role in clarifying to parents this is what's actually being taught, not the misinformation that we're seeing out there."" Protests began at Parkfield Community School, where most pupils are Muslim, in February. Parents called for an end to the use of story books featuring same sex couples, as part of a programme teaching about equality. Protesters chanted ""Our children, our choice"", arguing their religion did not accept homosexuality. Weeks later, the school suspended its ""No Outsiders"" programme, to consult with parents. Protests were also held at Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham. Campaigners said homosexuality was morally wrong and it was inappropriate to teach young children about same-sex relationships. The schools, however, said they were teaching children about diversity in society and all the groups covered by the Equality Act. From September 2020, it will be compulsory to teach relationships education for primary-age pupils and relationships and sex education (RSE) for secondary-age pupils. The government says it wants primary schools to teach children about same sex relationships but, as with the rest of the curriculum, it would be up to them to decide when it was ""age appropriate"". The guidance for schools also says teaching should be ""with respect to the backgrounds and beliefs of pupils and parents"". The government has said parents should be consulted about what was taught, but they would not have a veto. Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC: ""We want children to grow up understanding that some people are different, some relationships are different from what they may have experienced, but all are valuable. ""We trust individual schools, individual head teachers, to know their cohorts of children, and to determine how and when to address what can be obviously sensitive subjects."" Panorama has learned Parkfield Community School believed it was getting a very different message, and that it felt under pressure from the Department for Education to suspend its equality programme to get the school out of the news. A letter seen by the programme from the school to a DfE official suggested: ""The DfE would like us to stop our teaching of equality to make this issue disappear."" It also quoted a department official saying: ""Our top priority is that Parkfield School is no longer on national news."" The DfE said it did not accept pressure was applied to stop teaching about equality at Parkfield. It said any suggestion the dispute should be kept out of the media was not intended to silence the school but to bring an end to the protests and encourage consultation. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said the suspension of the programme made the situation worse. ""It gave an impression, it gave almost licence, to people in communities that actually if they turned up outside of a school with loud hailers and protest that other schools would back down too,"" said Rob Kelsall, national secretary of the NAHT. ""I think that was a fatal mistake."" 'War on LGBT kids' Other schools were also seeing a push back from parents and campaigners, he added. ""We're seeing cases being referred almost on a weekly basis now… over 70 schools where these issues have been raised directly. ""Letters being sent to school leaders asking the school to stop teaching relationship education, threats to withdraw their children, through to organised rallies and events."" Human rights and LGBT activist Peter Tatchell said he thought the protesters were ""declaring war on LGBT kids"". ""They're saying that these children should not get love and support and advice in their school,"" he said. Panorama has spoken to other religious groups around the country which said they had been energised by the protests in Birmingham and were looking to build campaigns of their own. Pauline Gallagher lives just outside Glasgow and has set up a group called Catholic Family Voice. She has been impressed by the protesters in Birmingham, and said she hoped to join forces with those involved. ""The Muslim community in Birmingham are total stars as far as we are concerned and they are trailblazers,"" she said. ""We are encouraged by what we see. I would say we're excited."" 'Aiming to disrupt' Other groups have been taking their message directly to the school gates. Susan Mason has been actively leafleting schools. ""I'm aiming to disrupt essentially,"" she said. ""I'm not wanting riots and protests outside schools, but either the parents need to be satisfied or the school will need to change what it's doing."" Judith Nemeth runs The Values Foundation, set up last year to promote the views of faith and traditional family values in education. ""There's no way that people of faith will teach it's OK to be gay,"" she said. ""They won't because the bible tells us it isn't OK to be gay. ""But that doesn't mean that we are intolerant of people who do follow that lifestyle. Nobody's being judgemental here, nobody's being homophobic."" Sex Education: The LGBT Debate in Schools - Panorama, will be broadcast on BBC One on Monday 15 July at 20:30 BST","The government was ""too slow to respond"" to ""mob"" protests over LGBT teaching outside Birmingham schools, according to the woman tasked with challenging extremism."
"Police said it was the first conviction in the UK relating to football industry corruption. Tommy Wright, Barnsley Football Club's ex-assistant head coach, was sentenced to 12 months, suspended for a year. Giuseppe ""Pino"" Pagliara, of Bury, and Dax Price, of Sittingbourne, were also sentenced at Southwark Crown Court. The three men were brought to trial after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph, which ""published a number of exposés of alleged corruption in English football"" in September 2016. During the trial, the court heard Wright, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was handed an envelope of £5,000 in cash by the newspaper's undercover reporter Claire Newell. More stories from around Yorkshire He is also understood to have leaked information about Barnsley players at a meeting in August 2016. The trial heard some of the players were encouraged to sign up with Pagliara and Price, who both broke football rules by acting as ""third-party"" owners of players in a bid to profit when they were sold on to other clubs. The men were found guilty in December. Wright, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was convicted of two charges of accepting a bribe in contravention of the Bribery Act 2000. Football agent Price, 48, was handed an 18-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, after being convicted of two charges of offering or promising a bribe contrary to the same act. Pagliara, 64, of Bury, another agent originally from Italy, was given a two-year sentence, suspended for two years, after also being found guilty of two charges of offering or promising a bribe. Speaking after the trial, Det Con Chris Glover from the City of London Police's Fraud Squad, said: ""This case is the first in the UK relating to corruption in the football industry and shows how offending of this extremely serious nature can lead to significant prison sentences. ""We are pleased justice has now been done and would like to take this opportunity to thank the Telegraph, Football Association, Crown Prosecution Service and Barnsley Football Club for their assistance with this case.""

"By Prof Kerry BrownKing's College London North Korea is the only country with which China has a legally binding mutual aid and co-operation treaty, signed in July 1961. There are only seven articles in the document. The second is the most important: ""The contracting parties undertake jointly to adopt all measures to prevent aggression against either of the contracting parties by any state. ""In the event of one of the contracting parties being subjected to the armed attack by any state or several states jointly and thus being involved in a state of war, the other contracting party shall immediately render military and other assistance by all means at its disposal."" In essence, therefore, if there is a simple answer to the question of what China would need to do if North Korea is unilaterally attacked by another power - say the US or South Korea - this sentence supplies the answer. It would, according to this treaty, be obliged to become involved - and on the North Koreans' side. This, more than anything else, shows the ways in which history continues to frame the relationship between the two. We have a very powerful precedent here. Even before the treaty in 1950, China committed a million troops to the Korean War once United Nations forces were involved. In defence of the North as a client state and buffer zone, it is more than likely to commit its much more formidable military assets. This agreement still stands, despite the immense changes to China since the period in which it was signed. After the death of Mao in 1976, the country shifted from its adherence to a utopian version of socialism, and undertook widespread reforms. These resulted in the hybrid, complex system the country has today. Its economy and geopolitical prominence have burgeoned. For North Korea, things have been different. Tepid attempts at controlled reform over the past three decades have had little success. In the early 2000s, the Chinese hosted its former leader, the late Kim Jong-Il, and showed him special economic zones in Shanghai and examples of how to create a manufacturing, export-orientated economy servicing the capitalist West but maintaining its Marxist-Leninist system. The attempt at persuasion evidently fell on deaf ears. North Korea's unique Juche ideology - a pure form of nationalism - meant that it resisted any attempts to copy models from elsewhere. To this day, the market, if it exists in North Korea in any shape or form, is highly circumscribed and geared towards supporting the country's military aims and regime survival. China's great points of leverage these days are trade, aid and energy. As the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, North Korea's most important patron vanished almost overnight. Since that point, the reliance on China has increased to the extent that is now almost a monopoly. Some 80% of the country's oil comes from its neighbour. Coal exports into China were immensely important - until sanctions stopped them in July last year after provocative behaviour. China has stuck to this agreement, with precipitous collapses in the North Korean economy in the ensuing year. Almost all of North Korea's exports are either to China, or through China to elsewhere. Some 90% of its aid comes from China. China is the only country it has air links with, and a rail line into. It was, until the mid-2000s, the only country, too, whose banks had relations with North Korean counterparts, through accounts in Macau in particular. Monies here were frozen in a previous spate of sanctions. Even so, one of the new targets of UN-backed measures is Chinese banks, which continue, mostly indirectly, to deal with embargoed North Korean companies or intermediaries. The main point of Chinese leverage over North Korea is widely believed to be its oil. Stopping this would lead to an immediate, dramatic economic impact. A few years ago, for a matter of days, the oil pipes into North Korea were closed, around the time of a previous nuclear test. China has, therefore, been willing to flex its muscles here. But wholesale stopping of the supply, rather than temporary glitches, is a different matter. Many believe this would trigger regime crisis, or even collapse. After all, the North Koreans are already living in a subsistence economy. Taking away this final lifeline could be fatal. There are powerful counter-arguments, however, that say things would not be so straightforward. North Korea devotes 25% of its GDP (gross domestic product) to military activity. The oil stocks there would last a few months. And that would give it time to embark on the devastating assault southwards that everyone fears, into the highly populated regions of South Korea. It would be a suicidal mission, but as the world knows from plenty of other examples, handling those with suicide on their minds is the greatest challenge. Nor would North Korea be compliant in other areas as it collapsed. Refugees would swarm across the border into China. A vacuum would appear. China would be faced with its worst nightmare - a space which the US and its allies might try to occupy. For all its seeming points of leverage and influence, therefore, the most remarkable thing about China and North Korea is the ways in which, at a time when the rest of the world is agonising over how to deal with a renascent, confident, powerful-looking China, this narrative is so brutally undermined by the ways in which its small, impoverished neighbour almost daily exposes its impotence. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. Kerry Brown is professor of Chinese studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London.","The People's Republic of China, a country averse to binding, treaty-based commitments, has always enjoyed a particular relationship with its small, north-eastern neighbour."
"An email to staff said the presenter's employment had been ""terminated... effective immediately"". It said the move followed the revelation of ""extremely disturbing and intolerable behaviour"" said to have taken place around his programme. Eight women accused the veteran TV interviewer of inappropriate behaviour in a report by the Washington Post. Following the allegations he was suspended by CBS, PBS and Bloomberg. Rose co-hosted the CBS This Morning show and was a correspondent for its Sunday night news magazine 60 Minutes. He appeared on PBS and Bloomberg with the Charlie Rose show. Rose apologised following the Washington Post story, but said not all the claims were accurate. The allegations span from the 1990s to 2011 and include groping, lewd telephone calls and unwanted advances. The internal email to staff from CBS News president David Rhodes read: ""Despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organisation, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace - a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work. We need to be such a place. ""I've often heard that things used to be different. And no-one may be able to correct the past. But what may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable."" Rose, 75, is one of America's most respected broadcasters and his interviews have won him Emmy and Peabody awards. He was named by Time magazine as one of its 100 most influential people in 2014. He is known for conducting in-depth interviews, including with such high-profile guests as former President Barack Obama, talk show host Oprah Winfrey and billionaire Warren Buffett, on his eponymous television programme which first aired in 1991. In recent weeks, numerous high-profile figures, including Oscar-winning actors and a Hollywood filmmaker, have been accused of sexual harassment. The accusations were sparked by multiple women speaking out against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and a subsequent campaign encouraging victims to share their stories of sexual harassment under the #metoo hashtag.",US TV host Charlie Rose has been fired by CBS News following sexual harassment allegations.
"The Cardiff Anarchist Network claim an undercover officer spent nearly five years in their group, forming sexual relationships with two members. But complaints about the operation will be heard behind closed doors in an Investigatory Powers Tribunal. Campaign group member Tom Fowler said it raised questions about open justice. The case is being brought by 10 women and Mr Fowler, from Newport, involving both South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police in London. Some of the complaints involve the case of PC Mark Kennedy who infiltrated environmental groups. His involvement with one group led to the collapse of a trial of protesters who had been accused of plotting to shut down a coal-fired power station. It led to a review of how undercover officers are deployed and managed in 2012. Some of the campaigners caught up in the Kennedy operation and the south Wales case are seeking compensation for the emotional trauma they suffered. They also claim the Human Rights Act was infringed. 'Nature of democracy' But the Appeal Court ruled on Tuesday that the human rights aspect of the case against the police must be heard in secret, at a special Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The tribunals were set up in 2000 to examine complaints about potentially intrusive powers used by intelligence agencies in the UK. Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson, Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Lady Justice Sharp said the tribunal did have jurisdiction to hear the human rights claims. But Mr Fowler told BBC Radio Wales that it raised serious questions for him. ""I think the existence of the Investigative Powers Tribunal in the case should make any fair thinking person quite concerned about the nature of democracy and justice in this country,"" he told the Good Morning Wales programme. ""We are not talking about terrorism here. We are talking about some very basic democratic protests."" Mr Fowler claims their anarchist group was infiltrated by a police officer posing as a Northampton truck driver. 'Chasing women' He said the individual went on to form sexual relationships with two women in the network group, cementing the group's trust with the police officer. ""We weren't necessarily looking for police officers in the ranks. He was quite natural. There were other people just like him who I knew, and still know, who are real people,"" said the campaigner. ""A key part of his infiltration technique was to be chasing after women. ""By being in relationships with these women they gained a level of trust within the wider group, because of those people being trusted."" Mr Fowler said the infiltration technique used against the group, in particular forming close relationships with its members, was not justifiable. The claims for compensation by those bringing the complaints is now set to be heard in open court in January, while the human rights issues will be heard by the tribunal in private.",A south Wales anarchist seeking damages for police infiltration of his group has criticised a decision to hold hearings into the complaints in secret.
"The tech giant, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said profits sank 16% in 2019 to $18.4bn (£14.1bn). The fall came despite the continued health of its advertising business, which saw revenue rise 27% last year. Shares in the firm dropped more than 6% in after-hours trade. Facebook startled investors in 2018, when it warned that its efforts to beef up privacy protections and content moderation on its platform would hit profit. The tech giant has faced criticism over its handling of fake news during 2016 elections, as well as the improper sharing of user data with Cambridge Analytica. More recently, its decision not to police political adverts on its site for false content has come under fire. In July, US regulators announced a record $5bn fine against Facebook to settle privacy concerns. On Wednesday, the firm also said it had agreed to pay $550m to settle an Illinois lawsuit over its use of photos for its facial recognition technology. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said that he expects the firm will continue to find itself in the spotlight, as it defends its support of targeted advertising and encryption. ""My goal for this next decade isn't to be liked but to be understood,"" he said. ""In order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for."" Shares plummeted following its 2018 forecast, but they had rebounded last year, as user growth and advertising revenues remained strong, despite ongoing investigations. On Wednesday, Facebook said an average of 2.26 billion people were active on its family of platforms each day in December, up 11% from a year earlier. Facebook alone counted an average of 1.7 billion active users each day during the month, up 9% - ahead of expectations. ""Facebook can't avoid change though,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The Cambridge Analytica scandal intensified regulatory scrutiny, and tightening data security as well as fighting fake news is an ongoing - and expensive - challenge."" Facebook reported more than $70bn in revenue for 2019, up from $55.8bn the previous year. However, expenses rose faster, increasing 51% to $46.7bn, driven by legal costs. Facebook warned that further costs were yet to come, as growth slows due in part to new privacy regulations. ""While we have experienced some modest impact from these headwinds to date, the majority of the impact lies ahead of us,"" chief financial officer Dave Wehner said.","Facebook has recorded its first annual fall in profits in at least five years, as its efforts to respond to privacy and content concerns took a toll on the firm's bottom line."
"James Seymour, the father of a child at St Sampson's Infant School, said more than three times the usual number of people attended Wednesday's AGM. He said they intended to show the educational and economic justifications for closing the school were flawed. The Education minister has pledged to meet members of the PTA. The school - the only one in Guernsey to educate children from reception to year two only - will be closed, along with St Andrew's Primary School, if deputies approve the Education Department's plans at their meeting on 30 October. Parents were informed of the proposed closures by letter on 19 September. The department's report, Transforming Primary Education, argues in favour of fewer, larger schools, which accept two or three classes of pupils each year. It says the closures will save up to £800,000 every year and ensure a greater range of specialist knowledge is made available to students. Mr Seymour said: ""We believe the department's arguments are flawed. ""We now need to focus on preparing as strong and accurate a case as possible. ""Clearly this is a huge task given the lack of time given to us by the department."" The two schools were threatened with closure in 2009 but deputies voted to retain them.",The newly-elected head of a Guernsey school PTA facing closure says there is overwhelming support for a campaign to save it.
"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News When Will Watts had to mothball his coastal tour business during the first lockdown, he decided to fulfil a long-held dream - opening his own fossil shop in Scarborough in Yorkshire. After nine weeks setting it up and much investment, he opened in late October and saw strong sales over the half-term break. But cruelly, within a week the prime minister had called another national lockdown, meaning that from this Thursday Will must shut his new store to the public. ""It has been the toughest year I've ever had,"" he tells the BBC. ""It does make you question why you do what you do."" Easier this time? Some things will be easier than in the first shutdown in March - for example, all non-essential shops can offer deliveries and click-and-collect, while the newly extended furlough scheme will be up and running from day one. And while a full list is yet to be published, it seems a slightly wider range of retailers will be allowed to stay open, with garden centres joining the usual suspects like supermarkets and food shops. Non-essential retailers that must close The government will publish a more detailed list in due course But, as Will points out, lockdown two falls in the vital period running up to Christmas and ""gift stuff is a big part of what we do"". ""We can do deliveries and click-and-collect but we are selling unique things that people want to see and feel before they buy,"" he says. ""When you go online you are in direct competition with Ebay and Amazon,"" he adds. Naturally he's worried about the future, as he has just moved into a new building and has his staff to think about. ""I think we can make it but there is a slight nagging doubt that we won't."" According to the British Retail Consortium, the forced closure of shops in November will cost about £2bn per week in lost sales as we enter the ""all-important"" Christmas period. That's at a time when shop sales are already well below pre-pandemic levels. Helen Sheward, who runs Gently, a chain of four gift and homeware shops in South East London, was hoping to make up some of her losses from the first lockdown this Christmas, but that won't happen now. ""People don't realise we've bought all of our stock for Christmas already,"" she says. ""I cried all weekend after I heard the prime minister's announcement."" She also thinks competing online won't be easy, but she plans to go to town on social media and use her shop windows as a marketing tool. ""In the last lockdown the shutters were down, but this time we are going to open them every morning so people can browse through the windows. We will keep refreshing the displays to showcase the products."" Her six staff will go back on furlough, meaning she will be running the business single-handed in a lockdown she fears could last well into December. ""It's a big ask for me - we have two kids, my husband works. But you put it in perspective and you think, we will survive and there are far more people living with much greater problems than this."" On top of the furlough scheme, which covers 80% of employees' wages, the government is offering shops forced to close cash grants of up to £3,000. However, the Federation of Small Businesses says for many this is not even enough to cover rent, while small business owners as company directors get little by way of income support. William Skinner, managing director of Savile Row tailor Dege & Skinner, thinks the government shouldn't be closing shops at all, arguing they aren't a major source of infection with proper social distancing in place. But he is optimistic about his 155-year-old business's chances: ""We've survived two world wars and we can survive this."" On the downside, he says the business will lose what little passing trade it had left after the first lockdown. In addition, fewer business people will need bespoke suits for business trips due to the travel ban. But he says the company learned valuable lessons in the first lockdown - for example, its tailors can now make suits and coats easily from home, although the cutting still takes place at the shop. The firm has also moved to an appointments-based system for fittings which he hopes can continue with the right safety precautions in place. William furloughed 17 of his 21 staff in the last lockdown but expects the figure will be closer to 10 or 11 this time. ""Now everyone is familiar and aware and going into it with more open eyes,"" he says of the second lockdown. ""But the question is how long will this last? Will we get a vaccine? Will the virus peter out? I am not sure.""","The new lockdown in England means all ""non-essential"" retailers, such as clothing and electronics stores and tourist shops, will have to shut from Thursday. It has left many thousands of shops scrambling to adapt. We spoke to some of them about how they're trying to prepare for the disruption."
"Flood water is being pumped away from parts of West Sussex where many people were forced to flee their homes. Residents living in Bracklesham Bay said the water level only dropped when an emergency channel was dug. However, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said the defences were not to blame. The Environment Agency said no further properties had flooded overnight but it was keeping a watch on river levels. It added that teams had been working round the clock with other emergency responders, checking flood defences and clearing blockages. Gordon Wilson, from the Environment Agency, said: ""We're investigating to try to understand what has led to such severe flooding here. ""And it is possible that given the diameters of pipes we put in as an interim measure, they were not sufficient to cope with such a huge amount of rain in such a short space of time."" Bracklesham resident Christopher Purchase said the water level remained static until the digger cut through the sea defences. ""It's pouring out of there like a plug out of the bath,"" he said. However, Ms Spelman, who was visiting the area, said the Environment Agency did not believe the sea defences caused the floods, but the ""sheer volume"" of rainfall. She added: ""I've been very impressed by the emergency services response and all the other partners involved... but above all the community, and the way everyone pulled together to deal with an extreme weather event of this kind."" Roads impassable Rising flood waters affected about 250 homes in the village of Elmer and caravans on two sites in Bracklesham. Two flood warnings remain in place for the River Arun watercourse at the Aldingbourne Rife in Bersted and Felpham. West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it had dealt with about 1,000 calls in 24 hours, evacuating hundreds of homes and pumping water from them. Sean Ruth, deputy county fire officer for West Sussex, said it had been ""an incredibly busy time"" and it was necessary to seek help from neighbouring fire services in East Sussex and Hampshire. Many roads had been impassable due to flooding. Closures remain in force on the A29 Lidsey Road at Woodgate and several minor roads to the west of the county. There are also restrictions on the A259 at Littlehampton and A281 London Road at Henfield. Nine schools in Bognor Regis and Chichester were either closed or partly closed because of the conditions, along with Felpham Community College. Laburnum Grove Junior School in Bognor Regis remained shut on Wednesday due to serious flooding, and is not expected to reopen until next Tuesday.","The Environment Agency is investigating whether or not sea defences in West Sussex trapped flood water, making flooding there worse."
"Six MPs have defected to the party in recent weeks, including former Tory MP Philip Lee, and ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna. Mr Gyimah was one of the 21 Tories who had the Conservative whip removed after rebelling against Boris Johnson in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Last December, the East Surrey MP quit as science and universities minister in a row over Theresa May's Brexit deal. The 43-year-old briefly stood in the race to become Conservative Party leader after Mrs May quit. The Lib Dems currently have 18 MPs, having been boosted by a victory in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election and the defections. Mr Gyimah told BBC News that ""the hard Brexiteers have won in the Conservative party - it is a hard Brexit party"". ""There just aren't enough Conservatives like me,"" he said, explaining his decision to join the Liberal Democrats. ""If I want to fight for the values for which I came into politics.. the values of tolerance, the values of being sensible and pragmatic and acting in the interest of the country, then the Liberal Democrats is where I can do that from."" Not long ago at Westminster, if you were on the hunt for a smile, you wouldn't bother with the Lib Dems. There weren't many of them, for a start, and those left were the last survivors of a near apocalypse for the party; shrivelled, ignored and drowned out. Not any more. They are bouncy, tiggerish and expanding. They hope their clarity on Brexit - win an election and scrap it - will win favour with Remain inclined voters who may find Labour's pitch rather more ambiguous. But their newbies face a big challenge: can they, realistically, win the seats they currently hold as Liberal Democrats? Or will they go hunting for more fertile Lib Dem territory elsewhere - potentially dislodging long standing local party stalwarts? Addressing the Liberal Democrats conference in Bournemouth, Mr Gyimah said: ""There is now no orderly way for the UK to leave the EU on October 31. ""If the prime minister got a deal at the European Council on October 17 and 18, it would not be possible for us to leave on October 31 in an orderly way."" He added that the government has been left in a position where ""no-deal"" is the only outcome that can be delivered. He said he had been ""disheartened"" by the way the whipping process ""had been framed... for us MPs to choose our careers, in other words our own salaries, over putting the country first."" Mr Gyimah, who has been sitting as an Independent after losing the Conservative whip, has been a prominent advocate for a second referendum. He previously signalled his intention to stand as an independent candidate in East Surrey in the event of a snap general election. Who is Sam Gyimah? Mr Gyimah was born in Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire. When he was six years old, his parents split up and he moved with his mother to her native Ghana, while his father remained in the UK. He attended Achimota school, a state school in the capital of Accra, before returning to the UK to complete his GCSEs and A-levels at Freman College, a comprehensive in Hertfordshire. Mr Gyimah went on to win a place at Somerville College, Oxford, to read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), and served as president of the Oxford Union in 1997. An Arsenal fan, he worked for Goldman Sachs for five years as an investment banker before moving into politics, standing unsuccessfully for Camden council elections in 2006. In 2010 he became the MP for East Surrey and had been in Westminster for two years when he was made parliamentary private secretary to the then PM David Cameron. He went on to become a government whip in 2013 and childcare and education minister a year later, before becoming prisons minister in 2016 and universities minister after that. The married father-of-two quit as universities minister in December last year over Theresa May's Brexit deal. He was introduced to delegates at the conference by the party's leader Jo Swinson as the ""newest Liberal Democrat MP"". Speaking to the conference, Mr Gyimah said he did not take the decision to join the Lib Dems lightly and had started reconsidering his position in the Tories while Mrs May negotiated her deal with the EU. But he said his concerns with the Conservative party now ""go beyond Brexit"". ""The values we have taken for granted for so long in our country... are under threat,"" Mr Gyimah said. ""What Jo and I discussed are the Liberal Democrats have a unique opportunity to fight to defend those values and create a new force in British politics. That is why I find myself here today."" He said ""the problem is not just on the Conservative side. When I look across the aisle, I also see on the Labour benches the same issue I have seen on the Conservative side, a doctrinaire, intolerant approach which means centrists are being squeezed out"". Mr Gyimah's move was welcomed by Lib Dem MPs. Mr Umunna tweeted he was ""absolutely delighted"" and Layla Moran said: ""Welcome... So delighted to have you on the team"". Chris White, a former government adviser, told the BBC it was ""extremely disappointing"" to see Mr Gyimah join the Lib Dems because he ""stood on a manifesto pledge to deliver the referendum and here he is switching to a party which is manifestly not going to do that"". A bid by Mr Johnson for an autumn general election has so far been rejected by MPs who wanted to first make sure a bill designed to avoid a no-deal Brexit became law. But since the bill, which seeks to force Mr Johnson to ask for a extension to the deadline, has been given Royal Assent, opposition MPs are preparing to start their general election campaigns. As the Lib Dem conference opened, Ms Swinson said the party's anti-Brexit message should be ""unequivocal"" in a general election campaign. She expressed her hopes that members would back her policy proposal of scrapping Brexit without another referendum.",Former Conservative MP Sam Gyimah has joined the Liberal Democrats.
"Nick Haves, 47, was diagnosed with a meningioma and believed proton beam therapy would be his best option, but was told he did not qualify for it on the NHS. His family launched a fundraising campaign to pay for it and £60,000 required was raised within weeks. Mr Haves said the results made him ""even more thankful"" for the support. Proton beam therapy is a specialist form of radiotherapy that uses a high-energy beam of protons rather than X-rays. It is particularly appropriate for highly complex brain, head and neck cancers and sarcomas, and for certain cancers in children. 'Even more thankful' NHS England said the eligibility and suitability of patients was determined by a national panel of specialist doctors on a case-by-case basis. In June 2018, Mr Haves, from Sheriffhales in Shropshire, started to get double vision and his left eye began to droop but his tumour was not diagnosed for some months afterwards. After undergoing radiotherapy treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in his 20s, he believed proton beam therapy would offer the best treatment and reduce the chances of him developing further tumours, Although it would not be a cure, he said, he hoped the therapy would stop his tumour growing and causing further damage. He has now been told, during a telephone consultation with his consultant, a scan showed the tumour had not grown since he began the treatment. ""It was a relief (and) my family are delighted,"" said the father-of-two. ""It makes me even more thankful for all the help we received, now I have had time to sit back and think about what happened."" His next appointment to check on the tumour will be in a year.

"The right-wing League proposed chemical castration for some sex offenders, with their consent, as a condition for parole. Several countries already practise chemical castration. But the League's coalition partners Five Star rejected the proposal. Revenge porn is to be made a crime, but MPs disagree over the details. Victims can suffer acute anxiety and depression when intimate photos of them are posted on the internet by ex-partners or hackers. The invasion of privacy can also harm them professionally. The bill - known as Code Red (""Codice rosso"") - will come back to the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday. The session was suspended on Thursday when opposition MPs occupied government seats in protest, during a very heated debate. Humiliation and suicide Revenge porn was at the centre of a case that gripped Italy in 2017: Tiziana Cantone, 31, took her own life after sex videos of her went viral on the internet and she was humiliated. A Five Star MP, Giulia Sarti, was also recently the victim of revenge porn, and Tiziana's mother, Maria Teresa Giglio, expressed solidarity with her. ""As you are an MP, perhaps what happened can serve as input to legislate and finally intervene against this phenomenon,"" Ms Giglio said. However Ms Sarti opposed another MP's amendment to criminalise revenge porn, which was defeated by 14 votes in the chamber. On Facebook, Ms Sarti wrote (in Italian) that Laura Boldrini's amendment did not go far enough. Ms Boldrini is in the left-wing Free and Equal (LeU) party. ""The topic is so sensitive that it requires wide debate not only in parliament, but also judicial and social, above all involving experts, victims, families, analysts, jurists and all the relevant state actors, like the post and telecoms police. It's a very important issue, so serious regulation must not be incomplete,"" Ms Sarti wrote. Chemical castration dispute The League's proposal to introduce voluntary chemical castration for sex offenders was rejected by Five Star, who accused the League of playing politics with it. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini tweeted (in Italian) that it was the right punishment for those who gang-raped an American woman in Catania, Sicily, recently. Three young men have been arrested on suspicion of raping the 19-year-old tourist. ""For the rapist worms in #Catania who raped a tourist there's no discount: certain punishment and chemical castration!"" he tweeted. But Five Star criticised the League for proposing chemical castration as a condition for letting jailed rapists or child abusers out on parole. ""It's a joke to say 'we'll castrate you, but only if you agree'. Chemical castration isn't the method, but prison and certainty of punishment,"" said Five Star MP Veronica Giannone. ""This proposal is just political propaganda, and dozens of my colleagues think so too."" Several countries, including the UK and Germany, offer sex offenders chemical castration to reduce their libido, under strict medical supervision. But some countries, such as Poland, Russia and Moldova, have made chemical castration compulsory for certain sex offenders, including paedophiles and rapists, on a case-by-case basis. The pros and cons of such treatment remain hotly debated by medical experts and human rights groups.",MPs in Italy's ruling populist coalition have clashed over a major new bill to tackle sexual crimes including rape and revenge porn on the internet.
"By June KellyHome affairs correspondent, BBC News The woman reported the alleged attack aged 15, in 2005, but during the Met Police investigation evidence was lost. The judge at the trial of her alleged attacker branded it a ""disgrace"". The defendant was later acquitted. Scotland Yard, which is to pay out £15,000, has acknowledged the failings and said changes have been made since. They agreed to the out-of-court settlement with no admission of liability. 'I was helpless' Rebecca was 15 when she went to the police and reported she had been raped by a man in his late 20s. She lives in south London and the officers assigned to her case were part of Scotland Yard's specialist rape unit based at Southwark, just one of a number of the Metropolitan Police's so-called Sapphire teams, which investigate sexual offences. This was 2005 and at that time the Southwark Sapphire team was badly under-resourced. In Rebecca's case vital evidence was lost. The judge at the trial of her alleged attacker branded it a disgrace. The man she had accused was acquitted. Looking back, Rebecca, which is not her real name, remembers: ""I think I just felt really depressed about it and really upset because I just felt like I was helpless and I didn't have any trust in the legal system any more. I just sort of gave up."" It was the start of years of depression. She began taking heroin and on three occasions tried to kill herself. ""There were times when I tried to take my own life and I was on drugs and drinking loads of alcohol. I didn't really care about my own life any more,"" she says. ""But my mum was always the stable base, she was always like a rock for me, telling me that I couldn't give up and if it wasn't for my mum I probably would have given up a long time ago, so I just thank God for my mum."" Her mother Sally was determined police should be held to account. ""I used to be frightened to question my daughter's headmistress. Now I would stand up to the Queen. ""I have been to Scotland Yard, questioned MPs, it was scary, but when it involves your children you'd stand up to anyone."" Officers reprimanded In 2009, three years after the alleged attacker walked free, four officers were reprimanded. Three received written warnings, a fourth was given what the police call ""words of advice"". An internal Met report detailed how in the Southwark Sapphire team untrained officers were investigating rapes. They claimed their bosses had decided car crime was a greater priority than sex offences. Later that year Sapphire teams across London were revamped and placed under one centralised Scotland Yard command. This followed police failings in the cases of two serial sex attackers - Kirk Reid and black-cab driver John Worboys. Meanwhile, with the help of the charity Women Against Rape, Rebecca and her mother were still trying to get justice. They enlisted lawyer Debaleena Dasgupta, who said they should try to bring a civil case against the Met Police. She says: ""There were some cases going on in the European Court of Human Rights which suggested that states had a duty to investigate rape under Article three of the Human Rights Act. ""There wasn't anything in the UK courts and actually there still isn't so it was still a bit tenuous but we tried to pull everything together. We were trying to establish that the police have a duty to victims of rape and sexual assault to investigate those crimes properly and that if they fail to do so it is a breach of the victim's human rights."" After the family's earlier bad experience with the police, Sally was astonished at what she feels were the rough tactics by Scotland Yard in the civil case. She says: ""They have behaved appallingly. My daughter was a victim. All she did was report a crime and she expected the service that anyone should expect. ""To be honest the way they fought it was really dirty and I just think they should have just held their hands up and said we're sorry. ""They did say they were sorry but in the next breath they were throwing everything up at us in court and it was pretty horrendous to go through and to have to listen to certain things. ""The resources they have spent in fighting us through the civil courts - had they put the same amount of effort into investigating my daughter's rape, I reckon he would probably have been found guilty."" It became clear Scotland Yard wanted to settle the case out of court initially offering £8,000, later doubled to £15,000. This was higher than £5,000-6,000 awarded by European courts in similar human rights cases. Rebecca and her mother agreed very reluctantly to settle. They say what they wanted was an admission Rebecca's human rights had been breached. But financially they could not risk fighting on as if they lost they would have been liable for massive costs. The Met's legal bills are estimated to have run into tens of thousands of pounds. 'Help others' Sally says: ""It's never been about the money for us. It feels a bit like we've been bought off, kind of like we've been given no option. ""But I guess this paves the way for other victims. It's been a nightmare but if this can change the life of one survivor then it's been worth it. ""I hope this can help other people and make the police realise they can't get away with treating people like this when they report rape."" And Ms Dasgupta adds: ""I believe that the reason that such a high offer to settle this case was made was to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to refuse due to the financial risks of litigation. ""However such an offer would not have been made unless the police believed that my client had a very good case. If they believed they would win, they could have gone to trial and sought their costs."" And she goes on: ""I think there are a lot of very good, very dedicated officers out there and in this case there were a few officers who were trying really hard and they were being stopped from doing proper investigations because the resources were being taken out of their department by people higher up than them. ""What we actually hope that police officers will be able to say I need these resources to investigate this rape and if they are getting refusals from people above them they can point to this case and say we could be liable."" In a statement, Scotland Yard acknowledged the failings in Rebecca's case. In response to criticisms of their tactics in the civil case, they said: ""We are aware of the victim's comments of distress at the legal proceedings and that some legal arguments may have appeared insensitive to the victim, but that is not the intention of the Metropolitan Police Service. ""We want victims to have the confidence that we are here for them, will believe them and will conduct our investigations professionally. ""To improve our service Sapphire moved under the command of the Specialist Crime Directorate in September 2009, with the aim of providing a more consistent service to victims whose care and well-being is at the heart of each investigation."" Since Rebecca's case there have been other more recent complaints about the Southwark Sapphire unit. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has been investigating and its report is due in the New Year.",A woman who made a rape complaint that was not properly investigated by police has reached an out-of-court settlement with Scotland Yard.
"Long Leys Court, in Lincoln, closed in 2015 after ""a number of serious incidents"" were reported at the site. Several of the incidents were also investigated by police, but no further action was taken. The NHS trust which ran the unit has said it is ""deeply sorry"" about the treatment patients received. The independent review, commissioned by the Lincolnshire Safeguarding Adults Board (LSAB), found that 39 vulnerable adults had suffered abuse while at the unit between 2011 and 2015. It said patients were sometimes over-medicated, inappropriately restrained, or ""deprived of their liberty without proper authorisation"". The review also said it was ""striking"" that the abuse at Long Leys Court took place in the wake of a public outcry over the abuse of vulnerable adults at Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol. Heather Roach, chair of the LSAB, said: ""Legislation to protect those with learning disabilities and complex needs wasn't embedded at Long Leys Court. There was a culture of bullying and the voice and concerns of individuals and families were not heard. ""While the unit subsequently closed, reviews such as this can identify improvements which are needed to consolidate good practice in safeguarding vulnerable adults from harm."" In a statement, Sarah Connery, acting chief executive at Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which ran the unit, said: ""We are deeply sorry that the standards of care at Long Leys Court fell well below what we would expect. ""We fully investigated all of the incidents and practices at the unit to establish what went wrong at that time and to reduce the likelihood of anything similar happening in any of our services again,"" she said.

"The five men, known as the ""wolf pack"", were originally given nine years in jail when they were cleared of rape. But prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court to upgrade the conviction and judges increased their sentences to 15 years. The attack prompted Spain to announce a review of its rape laws. All five had been on provisional release since last year pending the Supreme Court decision. Prosecutors had asked for their jail terms to be doubled to 18 years. Reports say that at least two of the men were detained after the verdict and arrest warrants have been issued for the rest. The court ruled decisively that the five had carried out the attack in ""a genuinely intimidating scenario"". Under current Spanish rape law use of intimidation is key to a rape conviction. What did they do? In July 2016, when the city of Pamplona was holding its traditional San Fermin bull-running festival, the 18-year-old woman was dragged into the hallway of a residential building. The five men removed her clothes and had unprotected sex with her. Some of them filmed it on their phones. The woman's phone was also stolen and she was found reportedly in a distraught state. They sent the video around their WhatsApp chat group, called ""La manada"" (the wolf pack), and the video has since become central to the question of whether they raped the woman or sexually abused her. A police report said she had kept her eyes closed at all times, showing a ""passive or neutral"" expression throughout. What was the original verdict? In April 2018, a court in Navarra jailed the men for nine years each for sexual abuse but acquitted them of the graver charge of sexual assault, the equivalent of rape under existing Spanish law. The ruling was based on a decision that the woman had not faced violence or intimidation, but had been abused. Two months later, the same regional court ordered the men's provisional release pending appeal as they were not deemed a flight risk. The verdict prompted widespread demonstrations from rights groups and politicians who were incredulous that a prolonged sexual assault involving intercourse by five men could be anything other than rape. Read more on the sex attack that changed Spain But the Supreme Court of Navarra upheld that conviction, agreeing there had been no sexual assault. They decided the woman had not given consent to sex and that the men had used their undue position of superiority to carry out sexual abuse. Two of the five judges decided the men had used intimidation to carry out a ""continuous offence of sexual assault"", but they were outvoted. What has the Supreme Court now decided? The court ruled that the original verdict was wrong as the victim had not consented to sex and it was carried out in a ""genuinely intimidating scenario"". The circumstances, it found, had been aggravated by the joint action of two or more people. The victim, the court found, had adopted a submissive approach faced with the distress and intense stress of being forced into a narrow and hidden place with no means of escape. José Ángel Prenda, Jesús Escudero, Alfonso Jesús Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero and Ángel Boza were each given 15 years. As well as a 15-year jail term, Guerrero was given another two years for stealing the victim's mobile phone. They were told not to approach within 500m (546yds) of the victim for the next 20 years, increasing to €100,000 (£89,000; $113,000) the amount of compensation. Prosecutors had asked the court to upgrade the conviction to sexual assault, arguing that the ""proven facts constitute a continuous crime of rape"" because ""sufficient intimidating force"" was used against the victim. ""You cannot demand a dangerously heroic stand from victims,"" prosecutor Isabel Rodríguez was quoted as saying. Defence lawyers had sought the acquittal of the men and argued on Friday there was no intimidation of any sort and that the woman had only complained of assault when she found out her mobile phone had been taken. The politically charged case has already prompted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez to push for a reform of Spain's rape laws based on a woman giving explicit consent to sex.","Spain's Supreme Court has ruled that an attack on a teenage woman that shocked Spain was gang rape, rather than an earlier verdict of sexual abuse."
"The Youth Select Committee report says it is ""extremely concerned"" over the government's plans to focus on a law and order approach to the crisis. It said the issue cannot be ""remedied"" by increased stop and search. A government spokesperson said it was ""taking urgent action to tackle the scourge of serious violence"". The Youth Select Committee is a British Council initiative made up of eleven members aged 11-18 and focuses on issues most concerning to young people across the UK. The committee's report said the government was not ""listening to young people"" or addressing their ""fear"". The Youth Select Committee report says social factors such as poverty and inequality are the main causes of knife crime. It urges the government to create a plan with clear targets and deadlines aimed at tackling the injustices which make a young person more vulnerable to knife crime. The government recently launched a £200m Youth Endowment Fund and a £22m Early Intervention Youth Fund, 10 year programmes aimed at steering young people away from becoming serious offenders. But the report says these these two funds do not go far enough in providing the long-term security for youth services. Committee chair Rachel Ojo said: ""If the government wishes to confront the fundamental causes of the rise in violent crime amongst young people, it must do more to address and improve the difficult circumstances many young people are facing."" The report's recommendations include: The issue of knife crime was referred to the Youth Select Committee following the UK-wide ballot in which 1.1 million young people declared knife crime their biggest concern. What is the scale of knife crime?","Harsher prison sentences and increasing stop and search will not prevent youth knife crime, a report from young people suggests."
"The mission involving the Lancaster Bomber from 617 Squadron was later immortalised in The Dambusters film. Its bombs destroyed the Möhne Dam in Germany on 17 May 1943. Northamptonshire auctioneers said it was expecting the Bakelite button to fetch between £25,000 and £40,000 when it goes on sale at the weekend. The bombs caused catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr Valley, playing a role in ""almost certainly shortening the war,"" according to Jonathan Humbert, of J P Humbert Auctioneers. Pupil acquired items According to Mr Humbert, the button was pressed by Pilot Officer John Fort on board Lancaster bomber ED 906 AJ-J, which was piloted David Maltby and was the fifth aircraft to attack the Mohne Dam. Squadron Leader David Maltby, gave the button and other items from the plane to the Hydneye House school museum where his father was headmaster. When the school closed a former pupil acquired the historic items. They included four large marbles used by bouncing bomb inventor Barnes Wallis in the development of his weapon. The marbles and an altimeter especially fitted at eye level to bomber ED932 AJ-G piloted by Guy Gibson to aid in low-level flying on approach to the doomed Möhne Dam will also be auctioned, together with a cockpit blackout blind from Gibson's plane. Mr Humbert said: ""These are incredibly rare and very historic items of a simply unrepeatable nature. I anticipate global interest in these evocative and iconic pieces of 20th century British history.""","The button from a plane used to release a ""bouncing bomb"" that destroyed a key dam during World War Two is to be auctioned."
"Fabric, in Farringdon, said it has agreed with authorities to suspend operations while the deaths of the 18-year-olds are investigated. One of the men died in hospital last Saturday after he collapsed outside the venue at 08:20 BST. The other man collapsed and died nine weeks before. The Metropolitan Police asked for the nightclub's licence to be suspended in light of the deaths. Islington Council has now agreed to its request. 'Class A drugs' The suspension is effective immediately and the club will have to stay closed until a review is held in the next 28 days. A force spokesman said. ""Officers felt the need to act due to concerns about the safety of those attending the club because of the supply of class A drugs in the venue and the recent deaths of two young men linked to the club."" A statement by Fabric said: ""For the past two years Fabric has operated without incident but tragically in the past nine weeks two 18-year-old boys have died as a consequence of drug overdoses.

"The dead officer was named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father. PM Theresa May said the attack on Wednesday was ""sick and depraved"" and struck at values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. The attacker has not been named. Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details. The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT on Wednesday when a single attacker drove a grey Hyundai i40 along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing three people and injuring many more. The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament. The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed. The attacker was shot dead by armed officers. Mr Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: ""He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen."" ""Heartbroken"" former colleague, Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to the ""lovely man"" he had known for 25 years. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman. Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood - a former Army officer whose brother died in the Bali terrorist bombing in 2002 - attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of PC Palmer. The attacker's other victims have not been named yet. One is known to be a woman. Mrs May said the attack was a ""sick and depraved"" attack on the heart of the capital. Such attempts to defeat UK values were ""doomed to failure"", she said. She paid tribute to the ""exceptional men and women"" of the police force who responded to the attack, saying: ""We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart."" The prime minister added: ""The location of this attack was no accident. ""The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech."" She is expected to make a statement in the Commons later. Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, said it was important to remember that ""this was a story about people who didn't come home yesterday"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""My message to those that want to harm us and destroy our way of life is: You won't succeed; you won't divide us; we won't be cowed by terrorists."" BBC Newsnight reported there was a suggestion the car used in the attack was hired from an address in Birmingham. However, this has not been confirmed. Armed police carried out a raid on an address in Hagley Road in the city on Wednesday night. A witness told the Press Association: ""They came and arrested three men."" The BBC understands the Birmingham raid is linked to the London attack. West Midlands Police referred inquires about the operation to Scotland Yard. In latest developments: Analysis By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent The carnage on Westminster Bridge and inside the grounds of Parliament is the attack that security chiefs here in the UK have long been preparing for. Terrorism looks not just to kill and maim - but to create panic and such a sense of disorder that it rocks a city or nation to its foundations. And this attacker sought to do so in as low-tech way as is possible. The days when terrorism meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are gone: Western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them. The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on. Read more from Dominic Eyewitness Rick Longley said: ""We were just walking up to the station and there was a loud bang and a guy, someone, crashed a car and took some pedestrians out. ""They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben. ""A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman. ""I have never seen anything like that. I just can't believe what I just saw.""

"William Hall became aggressive after being arrested in Darlington on Wednesday afternoon, Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court heard. The 39-year-old had earlier been seen driving erratically and was shouting and swearing at members of the public. Hall, of Sherborne Close in Darlington, admitted a number of offences. Durham Police said he was arrested on suspicion of driving offences and assaulting police officers. While being put in the back of a police van, he screamed at two escorting officers, making homophobic comments towards one and saying he would rape the other, as well as making several racist comments. Hall then threatened to cough and spit at the officers, saying he hoped they would contract the coronavirus and die. He admitted six counts of assaulting a police officer, drinking and driving, racially aggravated harassment and two counts of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Magistrates also banned him from driving for 12 months. Assistant Chief Constable John Ward said: ""Our officers should never have to face this kind of abuse while simply doing their job. ""Threatening to spit at someone is disgusting behaviour at the best of times, but it is even more despicable given the current circumstances.

"By BBC NewsStaff ""BBC challenges chicken PM"" is the Daily Mirror's take as it accuses the prime minister of ""running scared"". The Metro deploys a different animal metaphor, nicknaming Mr Neil the ""BBC rottweiler"". It describes his ""on-air challenge"" to Mr Johnson as ""unprecedented."" The number of violent deaths in London this year - 133 - has surpassed 2018's total, the Daily Telegraph reports. The ""grim milestone"" was passed yesterday, when a man in his 20s was stabbed to death in Hackney, in the east of the city. Last year had itself been the deadliest year for a decade, the paper says. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has told the Financial Times that - in the event of a hung Parliament - Labour would not form any coalitions or make any deals. Instead, it would seek to form a minority government and challenge other parties to ""make up their minds"" on each policy. ""Let's see if the Lib Dems vote against the real living wage at £10 an hour,"" he tells the paper. The FT's lead story focuses on the £25.6bn raised by Saudi Aramco, the country's state-owned oil firm, in its initial public offering. It is a record amount, the paper says, eclipsing the record set by the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba. But it gives the company an overall valuation well short of the $2tn craved by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Times is among the papers to cover the death of Dmitry Obretetsky - a Russian tycoon who was knocked down by a car as he walked back to his mock-Georgian mansion in Surrey.

From Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 to the apparent strangling of an Aeroflot executive last year, a ""string of wealthy and fugitive Russians living in the UK"", the Mirror says, ""have met grisly ends"". A friend of Mr Obretetsky has suggested to Russian media that he was ""targeted"". So, the Sun reports, there are fears he was killed on President Putin's orders. ""Was it Vladdy murder?"" the paper asks. Libraries shutting down Almost 800 public libraries have closed in Britain since 2010, according to figures published in the Guardian - a reduction of around a fifth. Since the start of the Tory government's austerity drive, the paper says, the number of library visits has fallen too, from 315 to 226 million. It points out that Boris Johnson told the BBC last weekend some local authorities, including his own, have been able to ""manage their finances so as to open new libraries"".

"The firm on Tuesday said a group including investment giant Blackstone Group and celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and Natalie Portman bought a stake in the company for $200m (£160m). The move is a sign of growing interest in milk made with plant alternatives. Oatly said the money would be used to expand and build new production plants. Founded in the 1990s, Oatly entered the US market four years ago and the product proved so popular it created shortages. Oatly announced its first factory in the US in 2018 and plans to open a second this year, part of a wider effort to add plants close to its customers. The firm's products are available at 50,000 locations across 20 countries. ""We chose to partner with Blackstone Group because of their tremendous resources and unique reach,"" said chief executive Toni Petersson. ""Our new partners' commitment to supporting us and furthering our mission is a clear indication of where the world is heading, which is in a new, more sustainable direction."" Sales of oat milk are expected to increase rapidly in coming years, as increased dairy allergies and concerns about dairy's environmental impact push shoppers to look for alternatives. About 41% of US households purchased vegan milk last year, according to a report by the Good Food Institute and Plant Based Food Association. The $200m investment announced on Tuesday represents about a 10% stake Oatly, putting the firm's value at about $2bn, the Wall Street Journal reported. Other investors in the group include former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz. Prior Oatly investors include Belgium-based Verlinvest and China Resources, a state-owned company. In the announcement, Jon Korngold, global head of Blackstone Growth, called Oatly ""a premier global brand... with significant runway for continued growth to meet consumer demand"". Blackstone has also emphasised its interest in sustainable investments. Oatly reportedly had about $200m in sales last year and hopes to double that by 2021. It has expanded its products from milk, to ice cream and yogurt and is eyeing growth in China. But the company faces increased competition, as firms such as PepsiCo's Quaker Oats and dairy giant HP Hood launch their own brands. New milk alternatives, made from products like peas, have also gained in popularity among consumers. In the US, dairy companies, which have lost ground to the alternatives, have also attacked plant-based rivals over the sector's nutritional claims.","Oatly, the Swedish company credited with convincing the masses of oat milk's merit, has proven its value to the investment world as well."
"There are now 48 confirmed cases and 47 suspected cases, with three of the patients in intensive care. The first case was identified on 31 May and two people have died. It is thought there was a common airborne exposure to the Legionella bacterium over south west Edinburgh but the exact source has not been located. The Scottish government said that the 95 cases included 12 people being treated in general wards, 20 being treated in the community and 51 who have been discharged from hospital. Seven cases are being treated outwith the NHS Lothian area. Cooling towers The ages of the confirmed cases ranges between 33 and 85, with more males than females affected. The Health and Safety Executive and Edinburgh City Council are continuing their investigations into the possible source of the outbreak. Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: ""As well as the efforts being made by health service staff to treat those who are critically ill in hospital, a tremendous amount of work is being undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive and the City of Edinburgh Council to identify and deal with the source of the outbreak."" Initial tests on cooling towers at the centre of the Legionnaires' outbreak in Edinburgh proved inconclusive. However, an incident management team (IMT) concluded last week there was evidence which suggested the source of the exposure was ""most likely to have been the cluster of cooling towers in Wheatfield Road"". The most common type of Legionella bacterium, Legionella pneumophila serogroup1, has been identified as the cause of infection in patients.",The number of people thought to have been affected by an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Edinburgh has risen to 95.
"In his Easter Sunday sermon, Cardinal Keith O'Brien will tell worshippers to ""wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ"" each day of their lives. The leader of the Church in Scotland, he will voice concern at the growing ""marginalisation"" of religion. His comments come as a case is going to the European Court of Human Rights to allow employees to wear crosses. In his Easter message, Cardinal O'Brien is expected to refer to remarks made by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010 that Christians ""need to be free to act in accordance with their own principles"". Former nurse Shirley Chaplin, from Exeter, and Nadia Eweida, from Twickenham, who worked with British Airways, are taking their call for all employees to be able to wear a cross at work to the European Court of Human Rights. Both women lost their discrimination cases in 2010. An appeal court judgment upheld the Employment Appeal Tribunal's finding that banning Ms Eweida from wearing a cross was not discriminatory because Christians ""generally"" do not consider wearing a cross as a requirement of their religion. 'Increasing marginalisation' Cardinal O'Brien will say in his Easter Sunday homily at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh that many people wear crosses ""not in any ostentatious way, not in a way that might harm you at your work"". He will say: ""Just 18 months ago, Pope Benedict XVI stood in Westminster Hall in London addressing a vast audience of politicians, diplomats, academics and business leaders. ""There he clearly stated that 'religion is not a problem for legislators to solve, but a vital contributor to the national conversation'. ""In this light, I cannot but voice my concern at the increasing marginalisation of religion, particularly Christianity, that is taking place in some quarters."" The cardinal, who is the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, hopes increasing numbers of Christians will adopt the practice of wearing a cross in a ""simple and discreet"" way as a symbol of their beliefs. A lapel pin costs £1 - less than a chocolate Easter egg - and could be given as gifts, he will say. Mrs Chaplin is being represented by the Christian Legal Centre. Andrea Williams, its director, said it was ""time for Christians everywhere to mark their allegiance to the cross"". ""I very much hope that in Europe there will be vindication for Shirley Chaplin,"" she said, adding that she hoped ""some sort of common sense will prevail"". A Home Office spokesman said: ""People should be able to wear crosses. The law allows for this, and employers are generally very good at being reasonable in accommodating people's religious beliefs."" The government says UK law ""strikes the right balance"" between employees' rights to express their beliefs at work and the requirements of employers. The law, and its application in the workplace, centres on article nine of the European Convention of Human Rights. The legislation backs an individual's freedom to act in accordance with religious beliefs but also recognises limitations ""in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others"". Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said Britain had a strong tradition of freedom of expression and tolerance. China address She said: ""It seems to me from a freedom of conscience point of view, from a freedom of expression point of view, you should be able to express yourself as long as you can do your job and as long as you are not harming anyone else. ""So of course, no-one would say a brain surgeon should be able to wear a cross dangling over a patient in a sterile theatre but equally you should not ban symbols just because people don't agree with them."" Meanwhile, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will deliver his Easter address from China. The Right Reverend David Arnott is visiting Church of Scotland projects in Yunnan Province. He will tell worshippers: ""The world changes at Easter. The days lengthen, the flowers, long-hidden, bloom in riots of colour and the very air, hopefully, feels that bit warmer. There is a sense of hope all around. ""It is that sense of hope that emerges from the darkness of a tomb, which underpins the faith of the church.""",Britain's most senior Roman Catholic Church cleric has called for Christians to wear a cross every day.

"It was shut in March so its sister hospital, the Royal Preston, had sufficient critical care capacity for Covid-19 patients, LDRS reported. But the hospital trust warned that a second wave or ""serious local outbreak"" of the virus could delay the plans. MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he would ""push"" for the date ""to be honoured"". Staff from Chorley were transferred to Preston during the coronavirus pandemic to ""provide focused care for seriously ill patients with Covid-19"", with Chorley temporarily downgraded to an urgent care centre. The long-term future of the emergency department remains in doubt, however, after a report last year by two clinical commissioning groups concluded it would not be ""clinically viable"". The unit had been operating on a part-time basis for three years and spent much of 2016 closed. 'Essential A&E services' ""We promised local people that we would reopen the emergency department as soon as it is safe to do so and we will deliver on that promise,"" said Karen Partington, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals' chief executive. ""We are working towards a September date for this. However, it is really important that everybody recognises that if Covid-19 cases begin to rise significantly, or other safety concerns are identified, we will need to revisit the situation."" The trust will now need funding from NHS England to make the necessary structural changes at Chorley A&E to enable the social distancing for patients and staff. ""After intense lobbying, I am pleased that we finally have a time frame as to when we can expect to see our A&E reopen,"" said Chorley MP Sir Lindsay. ""Residents have been forced to travel to Preston, Wigan or even further afield and this is a situation I do not want to see last longer than absolutely necessary. ""As Chorley and South Ribble sees continued growth in population, we need A&E services that support local need, and that is why it is essential A&E services are provided from Chorley and South Ribble Hospital.""",Chorley and South Ribble Hospital's emergency department could reopen in September after its temporary closure during the coronavirus pandemic.
"The analysis by the Cochrane Group provides solid evidence that should reassure parents considering having their daughters immunised, say experts. It looked at 26 trials involving more than 73,000 girls and women. Serious side-effects following the vaccine were rare. Campaigners maintain the vaccine can cause harm and say this needs to be explored more fully. Some parents say their daughters have become unwell after being immunised. The European Medicines Agency, The World Health Organization and now Cochrane have looked at the evidence and say HPV vaccination is safe and worthwhile. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""This study adds to the wealth of growing evidence from around the world which shows that the HPV vaccine is the most effective way for young girls to protect themselves against cervical cancer. ""Most women aged 15 to 25 years in the UK have now received the HPV vaccine."" Robert Music, from Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said although uptake of the vaccine in the UK is high, it is slipping. ""We cannot afford to get complacent. We must strive to reduce the myths and stigma around the vaccine."" Vaccine safety is kept under constant review and the Cochrane Group says that more data is required to provide greater certainty about very rare side-effects. What is the HPV vaccine? Girls can get it free from the NHS from the age of 12 up to 18. It is designed to stop them getting infected with a virus - Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) - which can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix or neck of the womb that, if untreated, can lead to cancer. The jab used by the NHS is called Gardasil and it protects against four strains of HPV - 16, 18, 6 and 11. Types 16 and 18 are the ""high risk"" ones linked to cervical cancer. Girls are offered the vaccine ideally before they become sexually active, meaning they are unlikely to have come into contact with the virus at that time. How dangerous is HPV? HPV infections are very common and don't usually cause any symptoms, meaning most people won't know they're infected. They can be caught by any close skin-to-skin sexual contact with another person who already has one. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own and doesn't cause any health issues. But some women with the high risk strains won't clear it and may develop cancer. Untreated, a third of high-grade cellular changes will lead to cervical cancer, which is why the NHS offers HPV jabs and smear tests to prevent or detect and treat any abnormalities. What about HPV jabs for teenage boys? In some countries, boys are also routinely offered an HPV jab - to protect them and their future partners. HPV can cause anal and penile cancer, as well as oral cancer. In the UK, the vaccine is recommended for men who have sex with men. What about older women? The jab should be given before someone has come into contact with HPV. The NHS does not offer the vaccine to women over the age of 18. All women between the ages of 25 and 64 should still attend for regular smears even if they have been immunised. The smear test can be used to check for HPV infection and to look for any pre-cancerous cell changes that might need treating.","The HPV vaccine routinely offered to teenage girls in the UK is safe and protects against a virus that can cause cancer of the cervix, an independent review has found."
"He fears the droppings, which contaminate his animal feed, may also result in salmonella in his cattle's dairy milk. ""The calves and adult cattle both suffer dietary problems, some become seriously ill and some die,"" said the farmer, who wishes to remain anonymous. Area MP David Heath (Lib Dem) has raised the issue with the government. Mr Heath, MP for Somerton and Frome, wants to explore ways of solving the problem but does not believe a cull is an option, as they are a protected species. ""We do need more research into the migratory patterns of these birds and find out why it's happening,"" he said. Thousands of starlings migrate from Baltic countries, such as Russia, to Somerset and other parts of the UK over the winter months. In recent years their murmurations as they prepare to roost have become a major attraction for wildlife enthusiasts. Mr Heath said he wanted to explore whether the Environmental Stewardship programmes could help farmers affected in this way. These schemes offer grants to farmers to help them manage their land and protect wildlife at the same time. No-one was available for comment from DEFRA. The farmer claims he has lost 40 calves as a result of the droppings contaminating the animal feed, but believes vaccination against salmonella is not viable as there are so many different strains. RSPB spokesman, Graham Madge, said: ""The fact that starlings are visiting Somerset are not because the RSPB are encouraging them, it's basically because these birds can find plenty of food in areas that are relatively warm for the winter. ""What we are doing is obviously highlighting the spectacle to the public because it's something of national renown.""","A farmer from the Somerset Levels has said roosting starlings are costing his business up to £40,000 a year."
"Councillors have refused permission for a private six-flat student house for Durham University students. The meeting was told there was ""already enough in Durham City and they're starting to spread to the villages"". The university said a rise in rent for in-house university rooms was proposed by not formally agreed. Pro vice chancellor Owen Adams said the charges covered ""much more than just accommodation"". ""Students benefit significantly from being part of a unique collegiate community for the rest of their lives,"" he said. Durham University Students' Union (SU) said the fees had increased from £4,854 in 2010-11 to £7,171 in 2017-18. President Megan Croll said a single room now cost more than a mortgage repayment on a two-bedroom new-build house in the same area. ""To many living in County Durham, they'll look at those prices [over 30% of the average yearly salary for the county] and get the message loud and clear, that Durham University, the world-class, historic university and the centre of their city, isn't a place for people like them,"" she said. Financial help was available for students from low-income families, the university said. Fees paid for staff, communal spaces for clubs and social events, and, in some cases, hot meals, it added. At a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the private flat application Liberal Democrat councillor David Freeman said the university had ""very limited interest in how students behave when they're not living on their own accommodation in colleges"". The university said it took residents' concerns ""very seriously"".",Students have protested about university-owned accommodation rent increases amid criticism too many students rent in the private sector.
"Edward Ham, 54, was declared dead in his cell at G4S-operated HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton, in February. Ombudsman Nigel Newcomen QC said the emergency response was ""unacceptably poor"" and staff could not access a defibrillator as it was locked away. G4S said it was unable to comment on Mr Ham's case while it was being reviewed. On Tuesday, the Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised HMP Oakwood for failing to tackle drug issues. Mr Ham's daughter, Jenny Knight, said her father had been sentenced to six years in jail for drugs offences in May last year. He was sent to HMP Birmingham in Winson Green, then transferred to HMP Oakwood in November. Ms Knight said her father had high blood pressure but a doctor had deemed him fit enough to exercise in the prison gym. On 6 February, staff found Mr Ham was not breathing but could not access a defibrillator because it was locked in a cupboard and there was no doctor on site. Ambulance delay An ambulance was eventually called but paramedics declared Mr Ham dead in his cell. An exact cause of death has not yet been established and an inquest into his death is due to be held at a later date. Ms Knight said: ""I can't believe how long it took for them to actually get an ambulance to him. ""We didn't find that out until the report came."" Mr Newcomen has sent Ms Knight a summary of his report which identified the ""serious failings"" in the treatment of her father. The full report is yet to be published. The summary said that Mr Ham, who was also known as Steve, ""did not receive a good standard of care in relation to the screening and management of his high blood pressure"". Mr Newcomen wrote he was ""particularly concerned about the poor standard of the emergency response"". He added: ""The emergency response when Mr Ham was found unresponsive in his cell was unacceptably poor."" G4S said every death in custody was examined independently by the Prison Ombudsman and it would be ""inappropriate to pre-empt the Ombudsman's findings"". The Worcestershire Health and Care Trust said it was not prepared to comment on Mr Ham's case until the full report had been published. HMP Oakwood opened in April 2012 and houses about 1,600 inmates. A report on Tuesday found one in seven prisoners said they had developed a drug problem while at the prison and that inmates had said it was easier to obtain drugs than soap. In response to that report, G4S said that running a new jail was a ""challenging"" operation. In July, HMP Oakwood was one of two private prisons which received the Ministry of Justice's lowest rating.","The Prison Ombudsman has identified ""serious failings"" by staff at the UK's largest privately-run prison after the death of an inmate."
"The plans, by Knowsley Council in Merseyside, were put on hold after the council's scrutiny committee asked for them to be reviewed. Speaking after a unanimous vote to proceed with the scheme, council leader Andy Moorhead said it was ""about protecting parks, not taking them away"". Knowsley Green Party said it was ""appalled"". Over the next 15 years the authority plans to put £40m from the sale of land into a charitable trust which will run the borough's parks. The Labour-led council said the sale would protect the remainder of its parks from government funding cuts ""forever"". It said funding for its green spaces would end in March 2019 and it could no longer afford the £1.3m annual cost. This plan would generate enough interest to meet the costs of running the remaining parks, the council added. 'No plan' Mr Moorhead said that by November he will have a ""full, robust business case"". Knowsley Green Party spokesman Kai Taylor said Labour councillors who supported the decision had ""let their residents down greatly"". He said: ""The scrutiny committee called this in for three reasons and not a single one of those have been addressed properly. ""There is still no real business plan and there is still not real detail about what will happen when the council transfers stock and personnel to this private company.""

"By Neil HendersonBBC News ""Our vision,"" says the UK managing director of Amazon, Christopher North, ""is that every book in every language should be available for you to download and start reading in 60 seconds."" Observers of the publishing industry say he and his fellow executives are likely to get their way. Amazon is in an ideal position to both pioneer and exploit this movement because it also makes and sells an ""e-reader"" - the ""Kindle"" - albeit in competition with a number of other manufacturers like Sony. But the paperback book, pioneered in the UK by Penguin in the 1930s, may have life in it yet. The same statistics show their sales are up too, but what industry analysts call the ""moment of cross-over"" has now arrived. Digital is becoming the dominant route to the reader. ""Our physical books sales are growing at the same time as our electronic book sales, "" explains Mr North. ""But it may be that some people want an e-book for one purpose and a physical book for another."" Strength To say that times are interesting for the UK's publishing industry at the moment is a massive understatement. ""They've had a tough year,"" says Neill Denny who edits the industry journal 'The Bookseller'. ""But overall publishing has been in rude health for the last decade."" That's because the industry has been able to profit from an explosion in the market for English language textbooks in fast-growing economies like India's. But while the actual business of printing and distributing books has been healthy it's been retailers who've felt the squeeze, operating on slim margins and often closing their doors. And as digital begins to outweigh ""physical"" sales, the industry will face the likelihood of even greater change. One problem is that the arrival of digital publishing has already altered the way in which we the consumers consider buying a book. ""Where do you go to see new books?"" asks Mr Denny, pointing out that booksellers on the net have often benefited from people seeing volumes on the shelf at stores and making a mental note to go online later. ""Breaking new authors is much harder digitally. Sure, you can build excitement with Facebook fan pages and the rest. But impulse buying of books can't really happen in the same way."" New readers start here But one author and leading academic reckons the explosion of e-publishing is a great thing for reading and literature generally. ""It amounts to the creation of a library without walls,"" says Professor John Sutherland of University College, London. Through my iPad (Apple's tablet computer) I can access a quarter of a million books - for nothing."" ""Time was the book could be in a library, be read a few times and be a dog eared offering. But now the book is a more complex thing."" Piracy But as publishers move to take advantage of the electronic frontier, they'll be mindful of a prominent casualty - the record industry. A cursory search of the usual suspect sites reveals books are starting to become available via unauthorised peer-to-peer filesharing. ""Piracy is the dog that hasn't yet barked,"" says Mr Denny. ""It hasn't really happened for e-books on any scale."" ""But people who know about Digital Rights Management say any content encryption system can be cracked. ""If piracy becomes a force, then that would be a source of major alarm for the industry."" Future But meanwhile the business of selling e-books is in its infancy and the industry is working on how best to exploit the almost limitless possibilities. Neill Denny feels the e-book ""softens people up"" for a future in which the book becomes a much richer experience. We could soon be opening an e-book and encountering not just text and pictures, he thinks, but audio and video clips, perhaps even games. You could even see films from within books. So the e-book won't be an end to literature but could instead be a route to an even richer experience.","Amazon has released figures showing that for the first time e-books outsold paperbacks in the United States. So do traditional books, printed on paper and sold in shops, have a future?"
"That is according to the most detailed inspection made to date of Devon's mental health services by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Inspectors also praised the compassion and commitment of staff. Chief executive of Devon Partnership NHS Trust, Melanie Walker, said the findings were encouraging. She said: ""The CQC observed consistently high levels of compassion, commitment and good, safe care among our frontline staff and we are very proud of this. ""As we would expect, the CQC also identified areas where improvements need to be made - and we are developing a comprehensive action plan to address these."" The Care Quality Commission sent 37 people over four days to conduct the inspection of six hospitals and more than 100 community services. Dr Paul Lelliott, CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said there was a strong culture of learning from incidents. He said: ""Staff providing cover out of hours are not always able to respond effectively to mental health crises affecting people living in the community. ""Most of the patients and carers we met described staff as caring and compassionate but, while Devon Partnership NHS Trust provided effective services in many areas, the availability of the service can all depend on where you live."" It may be years before all the improvements can be made, but inspectors say they will be monitoring progress to give mental health patients get treatment where and when they need it.","A long waiting list for psychological therapy is one of a dozen ""significant challenges"" facing the Devon Partnership NHS Trust."

"By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education reporter They are intended for parents even if they are not struggling with raising children, she said. About 50,000 parents in Middlesbrough, High Peak, and Camden will be offered vouchers for the classes from mid-2012. Labour criticised the government cuts to the children's programme it set up. 'Firm and fair' The classes, provided by parenting experts, are likely to cover areas such as communication and listening skills, managing conflict and ""strengthening positive relationships in the family"", as well as the importance of parents working as a team. There will also be a stress on discipline, with ""firm, fair and consistent approaches"" encouraged and the importance of ""boundaries"" being set out for children. And there will be advice on appropriate play for children's age and development. Ms Teather said she wanted to get rid of the stigma over asking for help. ""Parenting classes aren't just for struggling families,"" she said. ""All parents should know it's OK to ask for extra support and guidance when they need it - just as they do when they attend ante-natal classes before their child is born."" The trial will run for two years, with its impact tracked, the department said. It is hoped the results will lead a greater number of parents to seek help and advice themselves. The government says it is still working on the details but it is likely that the vouchers will be distributed through various routes. It was unknown if health visitors, GP staff or nursery workers would be involved. Ms Teather added that there was overwhelming evidence that a child's development in the first five years' of their life is the single biggest factor influencing their future life chances, health and education attainment. ""Armed with all this evidence, it is the government's moral and social duty to make sure we support all parents at this critical time. ""Parenting has to be one of the toughest jobs and it doesn't come with a rule book."" 'Out of touch' Shadow children's minister Sharon Hodgson criticised the coalition's policy towards Sure Start - a children's centre network established by Labour in the late 1990s to give more deprived children a better chance in life. Some of the 3,600 Sure Start children's centres are being cut because the grant that funds them was cut by 11% in last year's emergency budget, and again in the comprehensive spending review by almost the same percentage. The government also removed the protection from the Sure Start budget, leaving them potentially at risk as councils seek to make up losses to their central government grants overall. Ms Hodgson said: ""Labour is in favour of support for families and children, but the Tory-led government is completely out of touch if they think this is going to make up for the Sure Start centres that are being closed or hollowed out up and down the country... ""This government's reckless cuts programme is kicking away the ladders for the next generation and the closure of Sure Start centres is just another example of this."" Ed Owen, editor of fatherhood website www.daddybegood.com, said: ""Every teacher, psychologist and educationalist will tell you that the first years of a child's life are important. ""Some suggest that the first two years are decisive. This does not mean that every child must be schooled, drilled and disciplined to make them model citizens at this young age. No, it means that in the first years children must be loved.""","Free parenting classes are to be trialled for all parents with children aged five and under in three areas of England, children's minister Sarah Teather has said."
"Some 22 people died when the country's most active volcano suddenly erupted last December with tourists on it. Ten parties now face charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act, which carries a maximum fine of NZ$1.5m ($1.06m; £0.79m). A further three have been charged as directors or individuals. These individuals, who have been accused of neglecting health and safety obligations, will face a maximum fine of NZ$300,000.

The once popular tourist destination was visited by thousands every year, despite the fact that it had been erupting in some form since 2011. The volcano had been showing signs of unrest for weeks before the eruption in 2019, and was rated at Volcanic Alert Level 2, indicating ""moderate to heightened volcanic unrest"". Yet the sudden nature of the eruption took everyone - including authorities - by surprise. Tourists have not been back to the island since.

"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring According to Chinese video website Pear Video, an unnamed man in Rudong county, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, was pulled over by the police on 17 April for suspected drink-driving. He failed his breathalyser test, but was filmed by police protesting: ""I've just eaten durian fruit!"" A follow-up blood test proved that there was no alcohol in his system, putting the man in the clear. But it also prompted local police to subsequently carry out tests themselves, to check the legitimacy of the man's claims. A big stink In a 29 April investigation, Pear Video showed a police officer being breathalysed after eating some of the stinky fruit, and confirmed that his alcohol level directly after eating durian was 36mg per 100ml. The legal limit for blood alcohol concentration in China is 0.02% - roughly 20mg per 100ml. You might also be interested in: Three minutes after taking the test, police officer Yu Pengxiang was retested and the breathalyser showed a negative result. Pear Video subsequently warned users against eating the fruit while driving, along with other products that might show a positive result, including certain brands of mouthwash and lychee. Waste of 'innocent people's time' Pear Video's report has triggered thousands of comments on Chinese social media, with many surprised, but also concerned. Some on the popular Sina Weibo microblog are calling on the police to apologise to the interrogated man. Others are asking for improvements in the carrying out of breathalyser tests.

"By-elections were big deals back in the 1980s and none came bigger than the 1985 Brecon and Radnor contest, so much so that the BBC devoted half of the Nine O'Clock News to discussing the result. The contest was seen as an early test for the new Labour leader, Neil Kinnock and the SDP/Liberal Alliance which was still recovering from a poor result in the 1983 general election. Ironically, the chances of the Conservatives, who'd held the seat until the death of local MP Tom Hooson, were quickly written off given the unpopularity of Margaret Thatcher's administration. The Liberals, who hadn't even contested the seat for much of the 20th Century, chose a softly spoken agricultural college lecturer, Richard Livsey as their candidate. Mr Livsey, a man once described as ""wearing the right shoes to appeal to farmers"" had contested the seat at the previous election, coming third. His main opponent, Richard Willey, a Radnorshire councillor and son of a veteran Labour MP, spent much of the campaign out of the media limelight, closely shadowed by Peter Mandelson on his first outing as Labour's election supremo. Labour might well have won it too, had it not been for a speech two nights before the poll in which the miners' leader, Arthur Scargill, demanded the right to choose the next chairman of the National Coal Board. That reminder of the only recently ended miners' strike, along with tactical voting by Conservatives, were enough to put Mr Livsey over the top with a slim majority of just over 500 votes. This year's Brecon and Radnorshire by-election has received far less media attention than its predecessor but it could prove to be far more important politically. Losing Brecon and Radnor did little to dent Margaret Thatcher's parliamentary majority and she swept to victory in the subsequent general election. The 2019 parliament though is one where every vote counts, and where the vote of whoever wins on 1 August could prove crucial.",The voters of Brecon and Radnorshire will select an MP in a by-election on 1 August. Welsh Affairs Editor Vaughan Roderick looks back at another by-election in the constituency - one which was memorable for the amount of media coverage it got.
"Mark Drakeford said the devolved administrations had ""anxieties"" about the joint ministerial committee (JMC) set up by the UK government. It met on Thursday for the first time since Theresa May said the UK should leave the European single market. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said there was ""common ground"" on free trade. 'Grasp opportunities' The UK government's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said: ""As the prime minister made clear in her speech, Brexit is a chance for us to build a stronger UK and strengthen the Union between our four nations. ""It is only by us coming together that we can fully grasp the opportunities that our departure presents. ""We will use the latest thinking and analysis shared at today's meeting to inform our work to deliver an exit that works for the whole of the UK."" Mr Drakeford said Wales would continue to push for ""full and unfettered"" access to the single market, and wanted to be sure the forum was ""having an impact"" on the way the UK government was shaping its thinking on Brexit negotiations with the remaining EU member states. ""This is meant to be a fundamental forum,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""It was mentioned by the prime minister in her speech and I feel we need to be given confidence by the UK government that we are not simply here to express our views but that those views go on and make a difference."" While Sinn Fein said its ministers in the Northern Ireland executive may walk away from the JMC process, Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government would continue to engage with it to make sure Welsh interests were ""fully and significantly expressed"". Mr Cairns said it had been a ""constructive"" gathering, adding: ""Even the Welsh Government accepted today that the language that the prime minister used earlier this week about a free trade agreement with the European Union is not inconsistent with the language that they have talked about. ""So this demonstrates that there is a lot of common ground but I'm not underestimating either the challenges that are there."" The meeting - described by Mr Drakeford as ""robust"" - discussed papers from the Scottish government and Northern Ireland executive. He said a Welsh Government paper would be published on Monday and discussed at the next meeting of the JMC in February.","Ministers in Wales need to be given confidence their views on Brexit are making a difference, the finance secretary has said."
"By Lord BrowneChair, Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation This is not yet another article saying that engineering in the UK is ""in crisis"". That term has been so chronically overused in the last twelve months - to describe the economy, individual banks, various members of the Euro and certain politicians - that it has virtually lost its meaning. In fact, the numbers of young people deciding to study engineering and technology in the UK has at last slowly started to climb. But they still account for only around 6% of the entire student population. There is clearly something wrong when engineering companies in the UK are struggling to fill job vacancies at a time when more than a million young people are out of work. Contrast this with the scene in India and China, which produce half a million engineers between them, every year. Economically, the importance of engineering cannot be overstated. In 2009, UK industry contributed 21% of the country's GDP, but that figure has declined from 34% in 1990, according to UNCTAD statistics. Most other developed economies have experienced a similar contraction of their industrial sectors, but even so we are well behind the developed economy average of 24%. And the trend is still heading down. Compare that with the emerging economies and you see our challenge. India derives 28% of its GDP from industry and China a thumping 48% and the trend in both countries is sharply up. That is why, today, I am calling for up to 2 million engineers to be produced for the UK economy to help cure the often discussed weakness of the UK in turning world class ideas into global commercial successes. Competitive edge The UK economy needs engineering in order to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy. The UK has a world class knowledge base and we hope that the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering will re-invigorate interest and passion in engineering that will make the most of what we already have and build on it. This country needs an industrial strategy to set it back on the path to economic growth by capitalising on our greatest strength: innovation. We, the engineering profession, with the support of government, must enthuse and excite our young people to join us in reengineering the economy. Working together we must encourage schools to present engineering as an aspirational career. We must give students a financial reason to choose engineering at university - that means more scholarships, more fast-track courses and guaranteed work placements. Today we're taking the first step along that road. We're inviting nominations for a new kind of international engineering prize - one that will consider achievements in all areas from fashion to fusion and from telescopes to televisions. The aim of the Queen Elizabeth Prize is two-fold. It will celebrate the world's greatest modern engineering achievements, bestowing £1 million on the overall winner while proving to young people just how diverse, how creative, how relevant and important engineering really is. This is not simply a prize. This is a recognition of everything that engineering is and everything that engineering can and will become. In this task, we must not fail - the economic future of the UK depends upon it.","Lord Browne of Madingley is a former chief executive of BP who chairs the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation. Here, he explains the reasons for setting up the £1m prize and why re-vitalising engineering is key to getting the UK economy back on its feet."

"By Manish PandeyNewsbeat reporter Kim, 27, is a British Iranian living in the UK. Her parents came to the UK in their 20s, but she still has a lot of family still living there. The escalating tensions between Iran and the US have been causing Kim a lot of concern for her family. With the American assassination of top Iranian military commander General Qasem Soleimani and Iran's retaliation missile strike on a US military base - relations between the two countries are on a knife edge. Outside the region, British Iranians are concerned by what is happening in a country they consider to be a homeland. Radio 1 Newsbeat has been finding out what they feel about the situation. ""It's close to my heart and I'm worried about the family. We're all worried about them, their safety, their future,"" Kim tells Newsbeat. ""I don't think it's safe for any British dual national to go to Iran at the moment. I wouldn't feel comfortable if my parents went."" 'Really scared' Parsa Shahab is a British-Iranian finance student raised in Tehran, studying in the UK. He agrees with Kim that the current situation is scary for Iranians outside Iran. Parsa says his sister was in Iran when General Soleimani was assassinated, and he told her to return to the UK for her safety. ""Many of my friends at university had plans to go back to Iran after exams finish. But they've cancelled because they're too frightened about what's going to happen, and fears over airstrikes and attacks in Iran."" He also says there's been an impact on Iranian students who are relying on money from back home. ""Iranian currency has been hit. So students who are receiving funds from their parents are facing financial difficulties because the money has lower value."" ""So there's a lot of uncertainty for those of us outside the country too."" Parsa, 21, stayed in Iran until he was 16, returning regularly to visit his family. He says General Soleimani and Iranian forces have been fighting IS and protecting Iran from terrorist attacks. ""So if there's going to be attacks and we have weak borders, I'm frightened."" Kim blames the decision by President Trump to kill General Soleimani for sparking more dangerous times in the region. ""I'm not a Soleimani sympathiser or supporter at all. But that act has made the world a much more dangerous place. So you have to also think about the innocent people that are going to suffer the consequences of his careless actions."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today that the General had ""the blood of British troops on his hands"". 'It's too risky' After Iran's response, some such as 23-year-old Ali Reza Shahrestani are worried about the effect on the country's economy. Ali is an entrepreneur working with businesses in the UK and Iran. ""Nobody wants to invest in areas where there's war. It's too risky. So you need to have a backup option. And as someone in business, people are looking elsewhere."" He says the internet blackouts in Iran create uncertainty. ""It happens a lot ... sometimes 12 days in a row. So there are threats to businesses because they work with tech and there's such a reliance on the internet now."" ""If people stop investing in the country, jobs are at risk."" Parsa agrees: ""What will happen to the many young Iranians who are educated, have startups, and want a better relationship with the West? With everything that's happening, they cannot have that. They can't progress."" Facing discrimination Kim says being Iranian in the West, particularly in a time of tension, means people sometimes look at her differently. ""It's because of the perception of the Middle East. People have joked before 'oh you must be a bomber' when they've found out I'm Iranian."" And Ali has faced something similar in business. ""I have problems in meetings with investors simply because I am Iranian by blood. Even though I have a British passport, I am criticised because of my origin."" What now? Ali says that the current tensions between Iran and the US have created unity amongst Iranians. ""Even if people are against the regime and didn't like the general, when someone attacks us, everyone in Iran tries to unite and come together. And you can see that on the streets."" He's not surprised by Iran's response because ""they'll always protect"" Iranians. Some commentators think Iran's retaliatory strike could actually lead to a de-escalation in tensions. And Parsa, Kim and Ali all want the same thing. ""We were taking steps forward before Trump was elected, I hope we can return to that. But it's just so hard to know what's going to happen,"" says Kim. Parsa adds: ""Iran and the US haven't had peace for a long time. So assuming there's not going to be any tension is unrealistic. ""But I'm hoping we can see stability in the relationship with the US and Europe. That would be good for everyone."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU would indeed end the UK's membership. But it would leave some very important Brexit-related challenges still to do, including the UK's future trade relationship with the bloc, and with the rest of the world. Some people are worried that we might face a new ""cliff-edge"" at the end of 2020. What might happen next year? Under Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement, the existing arrangements between the EU and UK would temporarily continue, with goods and services being allowed to flow freely across the various borders with the continent. That arrangement is due to end on 31 December 2020. If Boris Johnson wins a majority he says he would negotiate a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU ready to go into operation at the end of 2020. An FTA is an agreement between two countries which eliminates trade taxes, known as tariffs, with the aim of making business and commerce run more smoothly. FTAs often also include measures to reduce other types of regulatory barriers that make trade more difficult. Is there enough time to negotiate a trade deal? The aim is to have a deal done in time for the end of 2020. That is a very challenging timetable. Trade negotiations tend to take several years to complete. They are technically challenging and politically contentious. Both those features can make them drag on. To take one example, the EU's deal with Canada took more than five years for negotiators to complete and another three before it came into force, on a provisional basis. The UK-EU negotiation will be unusual in that it is intended to establish a trade relationship that is less integrated than what the two sides have now. Usually, trade negotiations make for closer commercial relations, so past experience isn't necessarily a good guide to the likely timetable. Some people say that because we are already fully aligned with the EU the negotiation will be easy and quick. But for many Brexit supporters the freedom to depart from EU rules is one of the main prizes. How much we depart - on food standards for example - will be important for the EU in judging what restrictions to impose on British goods. That could be a time-consuming process. Could we extend the current arrangements beyond December 2020? Yes. There is a provision in the Withdrawal Agreement to extend the transition period by one or two years, but that decision must be taken by 1 July. So there would only be a few months of negotiating time before an extension would need to be agreed. Will there have been enough progress by then to allow us to be confident that it can all be done in another six months? After that date an extension could not be done with the arrangements in the Withdrawal Agreement. The Agreement itself would have to be amended or a new treaty agreed. There is some debate about whether that would be legally possible. What happens if there is no FTA by the end of the transition period? If there is no agreement the trade relationship would default to what is known as World Trade Organization (WTO) terms - which is what trade relations would be if we left the EU now with no deal. WTO terms mean British exporters would have the same access to the EU as do other countries with no trade agreement. That means the EU would apply to UK goods the same tariffs it applies to goods from the US or China for example. For cars that would be 10%. EU tariffs are particularly high for some agricultural products. British exporters would also face regulatory barriers they currently don't. If we do get a trade agreement, what would it mean in practice? UK exports would not face tariffs going into the EU. Whether they would have to go through some checks and tests to show compliance with EU rules would depend on exactly what was agreed. So exporting could involve more red tape and more costs for UK firms. This is one reason why many economists think the UK economy will be smaller with this kind of deal than it would have been had we stayed in the EU. How easily services businesses could supply clients in the EU would depend on the extent of regulatory alignment and on what agreement can be reached on working and travelling across borders. Can we have an FTA with the US if we have one with the EU? It would probably be more difficult. One clear potential trouble spot is product regulations, especially food standards. The US and EU tried to negotiate a wide ranging deal that ran aground partly on that issue. There were particular issues about chlorine-rinsed chicken, growth-promoting hormones used in beef production, and genetically modified (GM) foods. The US wanted to be able to sell these foods (or to do so more easily in the case of GM foods) in the EU. The EU wouldn't agree. In a UK-US trade negotiation, the Americans will want easier access for their foods to the UK. The EU would be very wary of any such foods in circulation in the UK finding their way into the EU's single market. If they thought that was a risk they would be more reluctant to allow unrestricted access for UK goods, lest some of the controversial US food should get in. If we don't get a FTA with the EU is that a ""no-deal Brexit""? The term ""no-deal"" was often used to mean no withdrawal agreement. So the scenario of no FTA at the end of next year is not no-deal in that sense. Ratifying Mr Johnson's deal would mean an agreement covering citizens' rights (EU citizens here and British on the continent) the financial contribution and the Irish border. But ""no deal"" is also sometimes used as meaning no trade agreement and a WTO terms trade relationship with the EU and that scenario is a possible outcome of Mr Johnson's approach.","The central element in the Conservatives' election pitch is a commitment to ""get Brexit done""."
"By Mario CacciottoloBBC News When Natalie Huss-Smickler arrived in England in 1938 as a 26-year-old, she found her new job as a domestic servant something of a shock compared with her secretarial work back home in Vienna. ""My first job in England was very, very hard,"" she says. ""I had to work from 8am to 11pm with an hour's break, cleaning and scrubbing and looking after the house, with half a day off a week. ""After a few weeks I complained, saying it's a bit too hard. The lady of the house said, 'If it's too much for you, I'll send you back to Hitler.'"" Natalie was one of an estimated 20,000 Germans and Austrians, mostly women, to take advantage of the domestic service visas being issued by the British government in the late 1930s. The women, predominantly Jewish, took the work to escape from the Nazis. This number means domestic service visas were hugely significant in saving Jews, about double the number saved by the celebrated Kindertransport - but their story has largely been forgotten. The holder of a domestic service visa had a priceless ticket to get out of the Nazis' reach - even if it did mean that many middle-class women, who may even have had servants in their own households, were cooking, cleaning, making beds and scrubbing floors for the first time in their lives. Natalie almost fell into the Nazis' clutches before she arrived in England. She was on a train in September 1938, bound for a ferry to England, when it was stopped at a Belgian border station. An announcement was made over the loudspeaker that all Jews should disembark. With a heavy heart, Natalie reached for her small suitcase. But what she did not reckon on was a group of nuns, in whose carriage she was sitting. ""The nun next to me put her arm round me and said, 'Sit down. You're not going out,'"" Natalie says. ""I said 'I'm Jewish.' The nun said, 'You're one of us. Sit down,' and she pressed me down."" So the young Jewish girl sat with the Catholic nuns, nervously awaiting her fate as Jewish men, women and children poured off the train and were lined up on the station platform, bound for concentration camps. What happened next became an unforgettable moment in Natalie's life. ""There came an inspection. A big SS man looked into the window at me and my heart was in my knees. He saw me with the nuns, gave me a nice smile, winked and walked on. I was saved. I was probably the only Jew to get through."" Once safely in England, she headed to London and her new home in Kensington, where she worked in a doctor's family house. She was grateful to be there - ""having a domestic service visa saved my life"" - but she felt her employers looked down on her. ""It was a large family all living together, including several brothers. The men didn't look at me, they didn't speak to me. ""I was allowed to sit at table, but if one of the children wanted something I was ordered to go fetch it. It's still in my ears, the voice - 'Natalie, fetch me a glass of water.' It made me feel very humble."" Unhappy with the work and conditions, she left that job, taking up a series of other domestic roles including working as a nanny, continuing to work after the war broke out. When the fighting ended, she decided to stay in the UK and has lived here ever since. She is now 99 and lives in London. Edith Argy, 92, lived in Vienna and came to England one month before her 19th birthday in October 1938. Edith says that she had ""not so much as held a broom"" before arriving on England's shores, hired as someone who could clean and maintain a house. ""When I knew I would be a domestic servant overseas, I did a crash course in Vienna to learn domestic skills. ""I totally hated domestic work. Although my family were poor I had never done any at all, because my father spoiled me."" Her first role was at a headmaster's household in Portsmouth. Although she says the family treated her kindly, she hated her new life, hated the food and felt cold, even when she was in bed. She felt so unhappy that she made a half-hearted attempt to gas herself in the oven. ""I just didn't want to live. I felt I couldn't take being there on my own as a domestic. I honestly don't know if I was trying to do it or if I was hoping I'd be found. I was really desperate."" She recovered and quickly left the household to take on a number of other domestic jobs, but remained unhappy. Eventually the war ended and she left Britain for a time, working for the American army as a translator in Germany. She later met her future husband, an Egyptian, when in Australia and eventually they settled back in London. Anthony Grenville, of the Association of Jewish Refugees, says the women who came over using the domestic service visas were mostly from well-to-do Viennese families and ""completely unprepared psychologically"" for their new lives. ""The British government brought in a visa requirement for refugees seeking entry from Germany and Austria after the annexation of Austria to the Third Reich in March 1938. ""This was a way of the government controlling the sheer weight of numbers of applicants flooding over from the continent, particularly Austrian Jews for whom the situation had become desperate. ""Although they took them in great numbers, there was a very clear motive for the British having Jews over - not to save them, but to provide labour for middle and upper middle-class households. A small number of Jewish men also came as butlers or gardeners."" Grenville says that while some were well treated by the families they served, ""that was probably an exception"", adding that many of the women faced such challenges as not being able to speak English, being given unfamiliar food and enduring a worse quality of living standard than they had enjoyed before. The Wiener Library in London's Russell Square holds documents relating to domestic service visas, including a pamphlet called Maid and Mistress, issued to those coming over to serve from abroad and also the female heads of the English houses. This particular document contains the memorable line, aimed at the servants: ""English houses are often colder than continental ones and you must expect to guard against the cold by wearing thick underclothes and woollen indoor coats."" This advice would have been little comfort to the young women who were far away from home, doing jobs that made many of them unhappy - but they knew that becoming a servant for an English family had saved their lives.","As the Nazis tightened their grip on power in the late 1930s, Jews in Germany and Austria began to fear for their safety. Many fled abroad using well-documented methods such as the Kindertransport. But less well known is the story of thousands of Jewish women who fled to the UK by getting jobs as domestic servants."

"By Owain ClarkeBBC Wales health correspondent The £6.8m plan has been designed to ensure Wales is able to offer treatment plans revolutionised by better understanding of human DNA. It is hoped patients will have faster access to genetic tests and targeted treatment could be offered. There have been warnings the Welsh NHS risks being left behind unless these services were developed. Humans have about 20,000 genes - bits of DNA code or instructions that control how our bodies work - but tiny errors in the code can lead to a range of different illnesses. Dr Rachel Butler, head of the Cardiff-based All Wales Genetics Laboratory, said ""precision"" medicine provided targeted treatment. She explained that for certain types of cancer, for example, treatments were being developed based on particular genetic errors that can cause the disease. Genomics for Precision Medicine Strategy proposals include: In the strategy, fears were raised that ""the current and future potential"" of genetics are ""poorly understood beyond the specialist field"". It said this ""limits the ability of the NHS to fully exploit the possibilities and creates risks for the international competitiveness of Welsh Health Services in future"". The strategy called for ""stronger arrangements"" to be put in place to prevent Wales from falling behind. It also said that, up until now, much of the infrastructure for genomics research in Wales has developed ""opportunistically"" based on efforts of individual institutions and smaller units. According to the strategy, a ""higher level approach"" was now needed which, if implemented, will ensure a ""bright future for the application of cutting edge genomic technologies in Wales"". Dr Rick Greville from ABPI Wales, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the ""vast majority"" of medicines being developed were using genomics as a component. ""Through genomics we will be able to identify the best medicine for the most appropriate patient,"" he said. Dr Greville said the strategy was important because it brought together everyone needed to play their part. ""It's really, really important for the NHS in Wales to be at the forefront of that science... and data collection and analysis."" Thursday's strategy launch by Health Secretary Vaughan Gething comes two days after England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said cancer patients should be routinely offered DNA tests to help select the best treatments for them. Background: Benefits and concerns Genetic illnesses like Cystic Fibrosis occur because a person inherits genetic defects from their parents and mutations can be passed on through the generations. Understanding the exact nature of those alterations can help scientists develop more effective treatments, and help them to identify new and more rare genetic illnesses. Most alterations are harmless, but if they happen in key genes they can can cause diseases like cancer. Understanding the exact errors can help tailor treatments to the individual, or small groups picking the drugs mostly likely to be effective. This is known as personalised or precision medicine. 'Tread carefully' Unlocking the genetic code can also help doctors better investigate outbreaks of infectious diseases and tackle issues like how some bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. More than 15 years ago, scientists first demonstrated the entire genetic code that made up the entire human genome. It took more than a decade and cost a hundreds of millions of pounds. But by now a person's entire DNA can be sequenced in a matter of days at a cost of just several hundred pounds. Ultimately, experts predict genetic tests might become commonplace ""at the point of care"", for example in GP surgeries. But the advances in this field have led to concerns about data security and patient confidentiality. Patients may also not want to find out about errors in their genetic code. That is why many experts believe that in a rapidly evolving field of medicine, there is a need to ""tread carefully"".","Patients in Wales will benefit from stronger services and more expertise in genetic medicine, under a new strategy."
"GM has admitted it failed to alert regulators and issue a timely recall of cars that had faulty ignition switches which could cause a vehicle to accelerate. The switches were linked to 160 injuries and 84 deaths. GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009 during the height of the financial crisis. Those filing the lawsuits against GM had argued that the firm violated their rights when it failed to disclose the defect. However, GM said it was protected from those suits that were related to vehicles manufactured before it exited bankruptcy in 2009. US bankruptcy judge Robert Gerber agreed with GM, and said that the lawsuits would have to be filed against ""old GM"", which is essentially the shell company GM set up as part of its bankruptcy proceedings which contains all of the company's bad assets. GM was forced to recall nearly 2.6 million vehicles as a result of the defect, and set up a claims facility to compensate victims who could prove they suffered harm as a result of the defect. However, those suing GM were generally those who were not compensated as a result of that fund or who alleged a loss of value in their vehicle as a result of the defects. The total cost to GM as a result of the switch problems is estimated to be nearly $400m. One plaintiff's lawyer estimated the suits, if allowed to proceed, could have cost GM billions of dollars.",A judge has ruled that General Motors is protected from dozens of lawsuits over faulty ignitions switches as a result of its 2009 bankruptcy filing.

The trust, which has been looking after the islands for 93 years, will now be stepping up monitoring of the seabirds to better understand what is going on. Ranger Tom Hendry said: ""Initial findings are concerning. ""Numbers could be down due to stormy or wetter weather as well as changes in the sand eel population, which is one of their staple foods, or something else altogether.""",There are fears puffin numbers in the Farne Islands are on the decline.
"By Louise CullenBBC News NI He's also autistic, profoundly deaf and has a severe learning disability. Routines have always been vitally important to Charlie and his parents. But over the past eight months, a lack of schooling and respite support has caused great anxiety for his family. ""School is a big part of his life, he's become bored and frustrated, "" Charlie's mother Debbie said. ""My husband and I have been working from home and we work full-time - we haven't been able to give him the time he needs to stimulate him. His behaviours definitely have become challenging and have regressed in that time."" School closures and the suspension of respite services have affected hundreds of families like Charlie's this year. Charlie usually receives three hours respite care on a Saturday afternoon. That was suspended during the first wave of Covid-19, but was later reinstated. However, the family expects it will be disrupted again with the introduction of further circuit-breaker restrictions. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said it has been ""working closely with colleagues across health and social care and education to ensure that measures, including bespoke arrangements where required, have been put in place to support families on a risk assessed basis and in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines"". 'It means so much' ""To somebody else, it doesn't sound like much - three hours a week, what difference could that make?"" Debbie said. ""But we so look forward to it. For our other son, I can go watch him play football or go out for lunch, or do normal things we couldn't do when Charlie is with us."" She added: ""Charlie needs constant care, he doesn't understand danger and you can't leave him on his own. ""You can't do normal things as a family - we can't just go to restaurants, we can't go to places because Charlie might crack up. He might not get out of the car, or be unsettled or frustrated, and lie on the ground. ""It [respite] means so much to so many families. It just gives you time to de-stress and just get a break."" Last week, the Education Committee at Stormont heard evidence on how essential services for families of children and young people with disabilities ""went to zero overnight"". 'Intensified isolation' Along with weekly respite, Charlie went to an after-schools scheme run by a charity called Sense. The Cunningham family paid for additional daily support from Sense throughout lockdown, to try to maintain stimulation and familiarity for Charlie. ""The impact is, people just haven't had that break from caring,"" said Richard Kramer, the charity's chief executive. ""Before the pandemic, people would have the opportunity to attend school, colleges, day services, short breaks, or receive therapies. ""And now, over the last seven months, hospital appointments have been cancelled, assessments postponed, day services and short breaks were closed. So people aren't getting respite, therapies, equipment during this time and it has really intensified this isolation."" Some parents at 'breaking point' As they both work full-time from home and have another son to care for, time is at a premium for Charlie's parents. The support from Sense meant he had two hours per day with a one-on-one support worker. But Debbie is concerned he will never make up for the time he has lost. ""I think he'll be behind, that's just one of those things we're going to have to accept, that his other milestones will not be met. ""I have a lot of friends with kids with special needs and they're at breaking point. ""We don't have family near us that can help us, and if you don't have any support and you're working... It's going to be a long winter and I'm not looking forward to it.""",Charlie Cunningham is 11 years old. He likes to play on his swing and ride his bike in the sunshine.
"Ryan Cleary, 19, and Jake Davis, 18, admitted being part of Lulzsec, an offshoot of the Anonymous collective. They and two others - Ryan Ackroyd, 25, and a 17-year-old boy - deny other similar hacking charges. Lulzsec claimed responsibility for attacking the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) website. Mr Cleary, from Essex; Mr Davis, from the Shetland Isles; Mr Ackroyd from South Yorkshire and the unnamed 17-year-old will all face trial in April 2013. Splinter group Mr Cleary also faces charges in the US, where he stands accused of breaking into a number of websites, including that of the US X Factor, in order to deface them and steal personal details. Lulzsec emerged as a splinter group of the Anonymous hacking collective in May 2011. Their name stood for Lulz Security - where ""Lulz"" is a play on words of the popular internet phrase ""lol"", meaning ""laugh out loud"". They employed techniques to flood websites with high traffic - known as a DDoS attack - in order to render them unusable. Lulzsec claimed to have attacked News International, whose website for The Sun was defaced with a false story suggesting that the newspaper's owner Rupert Murdoch had died. Lulzsec had previously posted a story on American broadcaster PBS's website suggesting that deceased rapper Tupac Shakur was in fact alive.",Two members of the computer hacking group Lulzsec have pleaded guilty to charges they attacked several high-profile websites.

"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website The body clock - or circadian rhythm - is the reason we want to sleep at night, but it also drives huge changes in the way our bodies work. The research, published in the Lancet, suggests the heart is stronger and better able to withstand surgery in the afternoon than the morning. And it says the difference is not down to surgeons being tired in the morning. Doctors need to stop the heart to perform operations including heart valve replacements. This puts the organ under stress as the flow of oxygen to the heart tissue is reduced. The doctors and researchers looked for complications including heart attacks, heart failure or death after surgery. They found: One of those involved in the research, Prof Bart Staels, from the Institut Pasteur de Lille, told the BBC News website: ""We don't want to frighten people from having surgery - it's life saving."" He also said it would be impossible for hospitals to conduct surgery only after lunch. But Prof Staels added: ""If we can identify patients at highest risk, they will definitely benefit from being pushed into the afternoon and that would be reasonable."" Obesity and type 2 diabetes have been shown to increase the risk of complications after surgery. Heart health is already known to fluctuate over the course of a day. The risk of a heart attack or stroke is highest first thing in the morning, while the heart and lungs work at their peak in the afternoon. Dr John O'Neill, from the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said: ""Scientifically it is not hugely surprising, because just like every other cell in the body, heart cells have circadian rhythms that orchestrate their activity. ""Our cardiovascular system has the greatest output around mid/late-afternoon, which explains why professional athletes usually record their best performances around this time."" Other possible explanations for the findings included surgeons being tired in the morning or their own body clock affecting their surgical skill, particularly if they are not ""morning people"". But Prof Staels said the researchers had gone to great lengths to show that the difference in survival rates was not down to the surgeons. The French team also experimented on cardiac tissue samples from patients and showed they beat more readily in the afternoon. And an analysis of the DNA in the samples found 287 genes whose activity showed a circadian rhythm - waxing and waning during the day. They then moved into mice and used experimental drugs to alter the activity of one of those genes and seemed to be able to reduce the risk of death. Prof Staels said: ""We believe we have identified a potential way to circumvent the disturbing observation that operations in the morning lead to more complications."" However, that will require more research to confirm. The researchers are also investigating whether circadian rhythms have an impact on survival in other types of surgery. Dr Mike Knapton, from the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Thousands of people now have open heart surgery in the UK. If this finding can be replicated in other hospitals this could be helpful to surgeons planning their operating list, for non-urgent heart surgery. Follow James on Twitter.","Open heart surgery appears to be safer in the afternoon because of the body's internal clock, scientists have said."
"Lorraine Noakes helped her estranged husband distribute blood plasma product GcMAF worldwide. It was packed in Noakes's garage at a rented property in Bournemouth from 2013, Southwark Crown Court was told. Noakes, 58, is due to be sentenced this week after she admitted selling the unlicensed substance under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. Cure 'exaggeration' Noakes, of Ringwood, Hampshire, separated from her husband in 2007 but did not divorce, the court heard. She suffered a breakdown in 2011 and left her job, leaving her in ""pretty dire"" financial circumstances. By 2013, Noakes was distributing GcMAF to customers worldwide after keeping it cool in flasks brought from the home retailer Wilko, the court heard. Her husband, David Noakes, of Waldershare, Dover, Kent, claimed the product could cure a range of illnesses, including cancers, HIV and autism. Noakes admitted she had heard his claims but ""hadn't seen any actual proof"" and thought it ""exaggeration"". The supply of GcMAF, via David Noakes' company based in Guernsey, was discovered after a Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency raided a Cambridge laboratory in January 2015, It led to him being charged in July 2017 with conspiracy to manufacture a medicinal product without a licence. He pleaded guilty to manufacturing, selling and supplying an unlicensed medicine, and to one count of money laundering, at an earlier hearing. Despite guilty pleas, an ongoing Newton hearing has heard Lorraine Noakes' defence lawyer dispute facts in the case, including whether she burnt documents. The hearing continues. She and David Noakes are due to be sentenced this week.","A woman distributed a so-called cancer cure after keeping it in household flasks, a court has heard."
"The Royal Mint had been asked to produce new 50p pieces featuring the UK's scheduled departure date. However, in a move first reported by Bloomberg, the coins are to be scrapped as the UK will not now leave the EU this week. A Treasury spokesman said a coin will still be produced to mark Brexit. He added that it ""will enter circulation after we have left"" the European Union. According to the Royal Mint website, precious metals are recycled by being sorted and shredded before being melted down. The 50p coin is made from copper, increasingly considered a precious metal, and nickel. Metals are then purified and solidified before being turned into new products, the site adds. The UK was due to leave the EU at the end of the month, but the PM was required to request an extension after Parliament failed to agree a Brexit deal. On Monday, Mr Johnson formally accepted the bloc's offer of an extension until 31 January 2020. The PM's acceptance means that the UK will not now leave the EU on Thursday - despite a ""do or die"" promise he repeatedly made during this summer's Tory leadership campaign and since entering Downing Street in July. Up to 10 million new coins were reportedly being made ready for the Halloween deadline, in a project championed by Chancellor Sajid Javid since he took office in July. He had asked officials to look at whether it would be possible to produce the coins in time for the 31 October date. They were due to feature a message of ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"". Mr Javid's predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative 50p coins to be sold to collectors for £10 each. Under plans signed off by the Queen earlier this month, three different types of 50p Brexit coins were to be made from gold, silver and cupro-nickel - a mixture of copper and nickel. The silver and cupro-nickel pieces were set to become legal tender. The design, featuring the monarch's head and a standard inscription on one side and the special message and date on the other, was approved at a meeting of the Privy Council on 8 October. The cost of designing and producing commemorative coins is met by the Royal Mint at no cost to the taxpayer. The Treasury said it would not comment on the cost of producing the coins as this is ""commercially sensitive information"". Mr Johnson had repeatedly said the UK would leave on 31 October deadline with or without a deal. However, the law - known as the Benn Act - required him to accept the EU's extension offer when he couldn't get his Brexit deal through Parliament in time for the deadline.","Commemorative coins minted to mark Brexit on 31 October will be ""recycled"" after the UK's exit from the EU was delayed by a further three months."
"Often controversial, always campaigning, the paper has millions of loyal readers, and more than a few in the corridors of Westminster. In the words of Press Gazette editor-in-chief Dominic Ponsford it is the newspaper that, like no other, ""echoes its master's voice"". So how has Paul Dacre, as one of the country's most powerful editors, left his mark on Britain? 1. Immigration Under Dacre, the Daily Mail has become ""Fleet Street's most influential force"", the Financial Times's global media editor, Matthew Garrahan, believes. The paper has set the news agenda even while being criticised for the tone of its coverage, he adds. In particular, ""the prospect of mass immigration"" has ""long been one of the paper's predictable drumbeats"", notes Tim Adams for the Guardian. One of the most talked about front pages described a ""swarm"" of migrants on Britain's streets - a phrase used by David Cameron in 2015 - while other headlines have linked immigration to pressures on housing, unemployment and crime. A UN report into the press coverage of the European migrant crisis found the Daily Mail to have ""exhibited both a hostility, and a lack of empathy with refugees and migrants that was unique"". But others on Fleet Street have commended the ability of Dacre's paper to tap into readers' concerns, and put immigration more firmly on the political agenda. As the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan wrote, ""he both channelled and shaped the conservatism of middle class Britain beyond London"". 2. Brexit ""Some have argued that Dacre's and the Mail's influence has been so significant that it can be held more or less responsible for Brexit,"" the Independent's deputy editor Will Gore points out. On 21 June 2016, two days before the referendum, the paper announced its support for Brexit, urging its readers to vote leave ""if you believe in Britain"". It joined the Sun, Daily Express, Daily Telegraph and Sunday Times newspapers, with Fleet Street highly split on the issue. Immigration, for so long a major cause for the paper, had become the main focus for Vote Leave in the final weeks of campaigning. The then prime minister David Cameron urged the Mail's owner to sack Dacre over his pro-Brexit stance, BBC Newsnight revealed. Dacre was said to be ""incandescent"" and his resolve to campaign for Brexit ""stiffened"". But Dacre had the invaluable attribute of having no political friends, Melanie McDonagh wrote in the Spectator. ""That meant that he could approach most issues without the fatal handicap of not wanting to offend the people he knows."" The paper's pro-Brexit campaigning has continued since the vote. Following the referendum, one headline labelled certain judges - who had ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 be triggered - ""enemies of the people"". But new editor Geordie Greig has come from stablemate the Mail on Sunday, which strongly supported the UK staying in the EU. It is yet to be seen if the Daily Mail's stance on Brexit will change. 3. Campaigns Dacre's campaigning has gone well beyond politics. He is ""the greatest campaigning editor of his era"", former employee and columnist Andrew Pierce says. One of his most significant drives was in 1997, when the Mail ran a front page featuring the faces of five men it named as Stephen Lawrence's ""murderers"". Speaking to the BBC for a documentary on the case, Dacre recalled the decision process of that splash. ""We were doing something pretty cataclysmic,"" he said. ""You trust your instincts, you go with what you think is right."" Stephen's mother Doreen said it ""made everyone in Britain listen to us"". David Norris and Gary Dobson were finally convicted of murder in 2012, 19 years after the attack in south-east London. In 2017, Sgt Alexander Blackman or 'Marine A' - the marine jailed for shooting dead a wounded Taliban fighter - was released from prison following a campaign by the newspaper. Mail readers raised £810,000 to help fund Blackman's appeal, to get his murder conviction reduced to manslaughter. But one of Dacre's longest-standing campaigns has been on the environment. In 2008, he launched the Banish the Bags initiative to ""clean up the country... and the planet"". The 5p levy tax was introduced in England in 2015 - which the paper heralded as a victory. In 2017, the paper urged its readers to ""Turn The Tide On Plastic"" as it launched a bottle deposit campaign. And earlier this year came the Great Plastic Pick-Up campaign - a nationwide litter-picking event urging volunteers to clear up public spaces. In March, weekend editions of the paper stopped being wrapped in a polythene bag. 4. A newspaper for women The Daily Mail is the only national newspaper to have more female readers than male. Rarely does a front page not feature a picture of a woman, and double page spreads are regularly devoted to lifestyle and health features pitched at women, with Femail covering everything from parenting to plastic surgery. ""Empathising with women is much of the secret of the Mail's success,"" Dacre told the New Yorker in 2012. Dacre has supported Prime Minster Theresa May and her leadership, but some do not credit him for his feminism. ""Never mind Brexit, who won legs-it"", said the paper alongside an image of Mrs May meeting Nicola Sturgeon in 2017. The piece inside - by columnist Sarah Vine - drew criticism of ""moronic sexism"" from Labour politicians, but the paper responded by telling critics to ""get a life"". Other columns by Daily Mail journalists including Jan Moir have featured headlines such as ""Glass ceiling? We've only ourselves to blame"", prompting much debate. However, as Hannah Fearn of the Independent wrote: ""It might be an uncomfortable truth to many, but it is women who want to read (and often to write) such pieces."" 5. Press regulation During his editorship, Dacre has overseen a period of unprecedented change in the newspaper industry. He was among those to object to the system of regulation of the press recommended by Lord Leveson. The Mail called the Leveson Inquiry - set up by David Cameron to look at the culture and ethics of the press - a ""sloppy piece of work"". Dacre argued self-regulation was the ""only viable way of policing a genuinely free press"". He will remain at the Daily Mail's publisher beyond November, as chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers. In his resignation letter, he said of the battle against statutory regulation of the press: ""I plan to continue playing as great a part in it as ever.""","Paul Dacre is stepping down as editor of the Daily Mail, after 26 years at the helm of the UK's second-biggest daily paid-for newspaper."
"US government sanctions have restricted supplies to Huawei on the grounds that the firm is a national security threat. Huawei said it would not hold any shares or be involved in managing the new Honor company. ""This sale will help Honor's channel sellers and suppliers make it through this difficult time,"" the Chinese telecommunications giant said in a statement. Huawei said it will sell Honor to Shenzhen Zhixin New Information Technology, a new company set up for the acquisition. The company is a consortium of more than 30 agents and dealers of the Honor brand, and according to Chinese media, also includes the State-backed Shenzhen Smart City Technology Development Group. Huawei gave no indication of the sale price. Bravado dented By Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business Correspondent When the US first targeted Huawei, as part of the broader US China trade war, founder Ren Zhengfei told me the 'US cannot crush us' Since then though, that defiance has been deflated. Honor's phones rely heavily on Huawei technology, so selling the unit off is a sensible and strategic business decision. But that doesn't mean it wouldn't have hurt both Huawei's bottomline, and its sense of bravado. US restrictions placed on US firms selling equipment to Huawei has made it next to impossible for the Chinese firm to get access to much needed US tech - in particular chips that go into its smartphones. Some analysts say the reason why Huawei is selling its Honor business is to raise enough cash so that it can invest further in its own chip-making technology, which would in theory help it to become more self reliant, and depend less on US tech. But getting to that stage takes time, and in the interim there are competitors lining up to take Huawei's place on the global smartphone stage. Equipment restrictions The Trump administration has increased pressure on Huawei over the past few years, claiming the company is a threat to national security - a claim which Huawei consistently denies. The US department of commerce now requires foreign semiconductor companies to first get a permit before selling chips to Huawei if they are developed or produced using US technology. Although Huawei has stockpiled microchips in an effort to survive the restrictions, it said this latest move was an attempt to salvage a brand that has struggled as a result of US policies. ""This move has been made by Honor's industry chain to ensure its own survival,"" Huawei said. Huawei established the youth-focused brand in 2013, offering phones in the lower and middle price ranges. Honor ships 70 million units annually, according to Huawei. It sells smartphones through its own websites and third-party retailers in China. It also sells its phones in Southeast Asia and Europe","Chinese smartphone maker Huawei is selling its youth-focused budget brand Honor. Huawei said Honor had been under ""tremendous pressure"" due to ""a persistent unavailability of technical elements""."

"By Jessica MurphyBBC News, Toronto Earlier this month, ice jams caused flood waters to rise in Fort McMurray, forcing some 13,000 people from their homes. The northeast Alberta city is no stranger to natural disasters. Four years ago a massive wildfire, nicknamed ""The Beast"", nearly destroyed the town. This time though, city officials and emergency services had something else to be concerned about: the global coronavirus pandemic. ""We're as concerned about that issue as we are about the floods,"" Mayor Don Scott told journalists. Keeping residents safe from the rising waters and from the outbreaks was ""two tracks we're trying to maintain"". That meant drive-thru - not in-person - registration for evacuees and getting protective gear for all frontline workers. Fort McMurray's mayor isn't alone in having to handle the response to a natural disaster while trying to avoid any contagion. Officials at federal, provincial, state and municipal levels across North America are grappling with planning for floods, wildfires, hurricanes, severe heat waves and other extreme weather events alongside the pandemic. The considerations necessary are wide-ranging, from managing already strained resources to sourcing extra protective equipment and figuring out the logistics of safely evacuating at-risk populations - even how to cajole evacuees, who might be fearful of catching the virus, from their homes. This week, 10,000 residents were evacuated in Michigan after two dams collapsed following days of heavy rain. Governor Gretchen Whitmer, noting the city of Midland in the US state could see historic high water levels, said: ""To go through this in the midst of a global pandemic is almost unthinkable."" Responding to any major natural disaster is already a complicated operation and ""this is just adding another layer of complexity"", says Rick Swan, director of wildland fire fighting with the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). But ""coronavirus has not stopped the fire season and it won't stop the hurricanes from happening"". That means considering ""everything you can think of and stuff you just don't"", says Silvio Lanzas, chief of Glendale Fire Department in LA County. Like many organisations, Mr Lanzas' is focusing on preparation and an early ""aggressive prevention action"" strategy. His crews are working hard to ensure brush fires don't grow into the major wildfires California has seen in recent years. They are also appealing to property owners to take steps protect their homes from wildfire, like properly maintaining their landscaping. Organisations like the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) are also urging those living in wildfire and storm prone regions to think in advance about how the pandemic could change their current evacuation plans. One of Mr Lanzas' preoccupations is the potential strain a major fire in the region could place on personnel. He recently had a firefighter diagnosed with Covid-19, which in the end meant 16 firefighters were quarantined for two weeks. ""What do we do if we have a third of our workforce off, or worse?"" he says. That type of scenario puts the commitment to mutual aid - when emergency responders lend assistance across jurisdictions - at risk if other regions aren't able to send staff to assist with major disasters. Another aspect of fighting wildfires that is getting a major overhaul is fire camps. Well over 1,000 firefighters can congregate in those camps, often for weeks at a time when battling a major blaze. Fire crews and support staff usually eat, sleep and work in cramped quarters, which will now have to be expanded to include extra hygiene measures and space for social distancing. What's the forecast? A series of April events suggests this may the deadliest tornado season in the US in years, says Trevor Riggen, senior vice president of Disaster Cycle Services for the American Red Cross. So far, the Red Cross has been finding hotel rooms for evacuees instead of opening shelters but ""we know we're going to open a shelter eventually"", he says. Extreme weather has become more common in recent years with this year's weather predictions suggesting another tough season. National agencies in the US and Canada are predicting ""areas of concern"" for wildfires in California, Oregon, most of the US southwest, and western Canada and the prairies moving into June. Last year, California wildfires led to mandatory evacuation orders for some 180,000 people. The Atlantic hurricane season begins on 1 June and runs until 30 November with researchers predicting an ""above-average"" season. When Hurricane Dorian headed towards the US east coast last September, at least one million people were ordered to evacuate across three US states in its path . In the US, Fema has set up a new ""surge"" National Response Coordination Center to help manage disasters in addition to Covid-19. ""That means when it comes to mass evacuations, it means considerations like evacuating a nursing home or extended care facility"", Fema administrator Pete Gaynor told The Weather Channel in early May. ""Have you done all the legwork to make sure you can move a possible Covid-19 patient somewhere else?"" Both the Red Cross and Fema say shelters will have new protocols in place like isolation facilities and multiple daily symptoms health checks. In some cases, officials in areas that have already seen natural disasters this spring have suspended measures that may have prevented people from gathering in shelters. And the American Meteorological Society issued guidelines prior to a wave of deadly tornadoes in the US, urging people to ""not let the virus prevent you from seeking refuge from a tornado"". The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also put out a guide for evacuees, which includes a suggestion to bring hand sanitisers or soap, as well as face masks, to any public shelter. 'As prepared as we can be' Fire Chief Brian Fennessy, with the Orange County Fire Authority, says if the pandemic had gotten started in July or August instead of late winter ""we would not have been nearly as prepared as we are going into this fire season"". Those months have ""given us the time to consider, it's given us the time to prepare"", he says. ""We're about as prepared as we can be for something unknown to us."" But he says: ""We'll get pretty good at this pretty quick."" Mr Fennessy has started working with a wildland fire industry consulting firm that has set up a database that allows fire departments to share lessons learned during the Covid-19 response. The pandemic has already changed how fire fighters respond to emergency calls and smaller brush fires that require a two- or three-day response. Mr Fennessy says his fire engines are now equipped with kits that hold about 48 hours worth of personal protective gear. Still, no matter how much preparation is done ""there are going to be some miscues out the door,"" says the IAFF's Mr Swan. ""This is going to be a learn on the fly type of event.""",Wildfires and hurricanes are coming this summer. Are emergency services and response agencies ready to tackle those catastrophes amid a pandemic?
"Like many, Hayley Matthews, 36, from Telford, Shropshire, was separated from her mother Rita Kenyon during lockdown.

"The bug, found by a naturalist group at the former Maerdy colliery, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, is distinct from the other known groups of millipede species. Steve Gregory, of the British Myriapod and Isopod Group (BMIG), said the 12mm (0.5in) species is new to science as it is ""unknown and undescribed"". BMIG believe it is the first millipede species found in the UK since 1993. Mr Gregory said it belonged to the Turdulisoma and Haplobainosomatidae family. The creatures are usually found across the Iberian Peninsula and it is not known how the millipede came to be in south Wales. Experts said it could have been accidentally introduced via imported industrial goods. BMIG said the discovery of a new species in the UK is ""very unusual"" as ""there is not much left to find"" because the country has a long history of biological recording by naturalists. A scientist at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology research centre in Germany claimed the species was previously unknown and gave the creature the ""working title"" of the Maerdy Monster. ""The Maerdy species is distinct from the four similar species and, therefore, will have to be formally described and named as a 'new species' in due course,"" Mr Gregory told the BBC. ""It is not known whether this is a genuine native species, having colonised after the last Ice Age, or accidentally introduced into south Wales."" The Maerdy Monster was discovered at the site in December by millipede expert Christian Owen who was working with a group researching spoil tips in an informal event called BioBlitz. ""It's a great find and because the millipedes are new to science it puts the old coal tips on the map,"" said Liam Olds, who runs the Colliery Spoil Biodiversity Initiative. ""They are important places for wildlife and we should be conserving them.""","A millipede found at an old Welsh coal mine - dubbed the ""Maerdy Monster"" - is a new species, according to experts."
"By Kanika SaigalSeychelles Known for its coral reefs, mangroves and white sandy beaches, 360,000 tourists travel to the Indian Ocean archipelago each year for a holiday of a lifetime. But look beyond the private islands, the boutique resorts and high-end restaurants, and the small nation is battling a heroin epidemic of huge proportions. Between 5,000 and 6,000 people out of a total population of 94,000 - the equivalent of nearly 10% of the working population - are addicted to heroin, according to the Agency for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation (APDAR) in the Seychelles. Per capita, the Seychelles suffers from the highest rate of heroin abuse in the world. Jed Lesperance was 20 years old when he first started taking drugs. He is 34 now. ""I started smoking cannabis with my friends every now and again. At first it was fun,"" he said. ""But over time I graduated to heroin and it started taking over my life. I was smoking heroin two to three times a day, even stealing from my grandmother to pay for my habit. Within a few weeks, I had become addicted,"" he said. Heroin makes the long journey from Central Asia, especially Afghanistan, before being smuggled to the islands via East Africa. Made up of 115 islands, the Seychelles has many porous borders, which makes them hard to monitor and easy for drugs to come into the country. Morning methadone clinics But rather than attempting a ""war on drugs"", which would criminalise the large proportion of heroin users in the Seychelles, the head of the anti-drug agency has introduced a Portuguese-style drug policy - considering drug addiction as a chronic disease to be treated. ""The Agency for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation was established in August 2017 and we introduced the Methadone Maintenance Programme (MMP) in May 2018,"" Patrick Herminie told the BBC. Heroin users have two options: Individuals have access to medical and psychosocial support under both programmes. ""Currently, we have over 2,000 people registered in one of our programmes and 68% of those are now gainfully employed,"" Mr Herminie said. Mr Lesperance is one of those people who has benefitted from joining a rehabilitation programme set up by the agency. Each morning, he visits one of the country's roaming methadone clinics - white vans that are manned by drug counsellors and qualified nurses to give the correct dose of methadone to recovering addicts. Dozens of people line up outside the open windows of the white van ready to show their ID. Their name, the date and time are logged into a spreadsheet and on receipt of the information, the correct dose of methadone is distributed to them. Mr Lesperance, who has been clean for three months, now works as a pastry chef in a five-star hotel on Mahe, the largest island in the Seychelles. ""Since I found work, I have a lot more stability and it has encouraged me to stay on the programme. ""I have also been able to give some of the money I earn back to my grandmother, which has made our relationship a lot better,"" he said. More on drugs in Africa: Michelle Sabury, who helps recruit drug addicts on to rehabilitation programmes, agrees that ""he is a completely different person"". ""When he first came to us, he was underweight and had very little hope. Now he looks a lot healthier and is able to go to work each day. We are proud of what he has achieved,"" she told the BBC. After receiving methadone, many of those enrolled in the programme stay to talk with their peers or a counsellor before heading off to work or back home. Some arrive with family members in tow, illustrating how the stigma attached to treatment in the Seychelles is slowly disintegrating. 'My boyfriend was a dealer' One of the counsellors, Levina Mosses, is a reformed heroin addict who now comes to offer support to others hoping to get clean. ""I started talking heroin when I was 17 years old. My boyfriend was a dealer at the time, so I never had to pay for drugs. ""But after years of heroin abuse, I had had enough. My only option was to get clean."" Ms Mosses left her boyfriend, also the father of her children, 11 years ago - and has been clean ever since. ""I think it's important to get support from people who have been in similar situations so they can see what it is like to come out of it on the other [side]. ""The heroin epidemic has touched so many people in my country, it's only right to be open and honest about the problems we are facing,"" she said. Following the rollout of the rehabilitation programmes, the price of heroin in the Seychelles has plummeted. Five things about Seychelles: ""A line of heroin - around 0.1g - used to cost around 1,000 rupee [$73; £57] but now it can be bought for around 30 rupee,"" said the anti-drug agency head. ""The main aim [is] to undermine all of the work that we have done in rehabilitating the population and get people using again, but we are determined to keep up the fight,"" he said. However, there is another threat mounting in the Seychelles as the popularity of synthetic drugs is now on the rise. ""We don't have any official numbers as yet but anecdotally, we have heard that dealers are starting [to] get their hands on new drugs, drugs that we cannot treat with methadone,"" Mr Herminie said. ""But we hope that the agency will be able to adapt quickly and target new threats that come our way.""",The island paradise of Seychelles is suffering from a drug epidemic of huge proportions.
"Jack Whomes, 57, was jailed for life in 1998 for the execution of three men on isolated farmland at Rettendon, in December 1995. His sentence has been cut from 25 to just over 22 years, allowing him to apply for parole as early as 2020. A High Court judge said he had shown ""exceptional progress"" in prison. In one of Britain's most notorious gangland killings, drug smuggler Whomes was convicted of killing three men in a row over drugs. Patrick Tate, Anthony Tucker and Craig Rolfe were gunned down with a pump-action shotgun after their Range Rover was ambushed in Rettendon. Whomes's accomplice Michael Steele lured the trio to the country lane and ordered him to carry out the triple shooting, the original trial was told. The case gained national attention and became known as the ""Essex Boys murders"" after it inspired a film of that name starring Sean Bean. Steele, of Great Bentley, Essex, and Whomes, of Brockford, Suffolk, were both jailed for life at the Old Bailey in January 1998. In 2006, the killers failed in renewed appeals against their murder convictions. Reducing Whomes's sentence, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the 1995 murders as a ""dreadful crime"" but said he had ""demonstrated exceptional progress"" during his term at Wayland Prison in Norfolk. She said he had taught himself to read and write, achieved academic qualifications and work skills, and ""shown a natural ability to teach other prisoners"". Whomes had also made a bed for his niece and writing bureau for his daughter in the jail carpentry shop, the judge said. He was praised by the Prison Review Board for his ""consistently calm and mature behaviour, self-education and dignified way"". Prison authorities were unanimous in saying he deserved recognition for his ""unusual degree of progress"" in custody, the court heard.

"The first and deputy first ministers were at the attraction to mark its first anniversary. According to figures compiled by Stormont, more than 800,000 people from 128 countries visited Titanic Belfast in its first year. It had been predicted it would need 290,000 visitors a year to break even. The £100m project opened at the end of March 2012. First Minister Peter Robinson said: ""The exceptional success of Titanic Belfast continues to exceed all our expectations. ""The direct benefit to the Northern Ireland economy through tourism expenditure has totalled £54.3m. ""There can be no doubt that Titanic Belfast has proved a world renowned attraction and an achievement of which we should all be rightly proud."" Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness added: ""Titanic Belfast has drawn in almost 500,000 visitors to the city in 2012 and positioned itself as a key attraction in its own right as well as a key motivator for pulling in visitors to the city. ""Employment has grown as a result of Titanic Belfast's worldwide appeal with an additional 970 full-time jobs created in Belfast. ""Titanic Belfast has had a very positive impact on our economy with its visitors contributing an extra £27.2m to the city's economy."" The six-storey visitors centre is close to the slipway where the Titanic was launched a century ago. Its opening coincided with the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking, in which 1,502 people lost their lives.","The number of visitors to Titanic Belfast has exceeded all expectations, according to Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness."
"Tate said there had been 143,000 visits since the revamped and expanded modern art gallery opened on Friday. On Saturday alone there were more than 54,000 visits - around double the usual visitor number and the highest ever attendance for a single day. A new extension, a pyramid-like tower called the Switch House, increases the size of Tate Modern by 60%. The structure, boasting panoramic views of London, was part of a £260m redevelopment project. ""We are absolutely delighted that so many visitors experienced the new galleries and performances at Tate Modern over the opening weekend,"" said Frances Morris, Tate Modern's director. ""Although we have almost doubled the number of regular visitors to the galleries during our opening weekend, we have space for it to feel comfortable even when busy. ""There has been a tremendous response from the public and we look forward to welcoming many more visitors over the coming months."" A weekend of special events to celebrate the opening included a specially-commissioned choral work by artist Peter Liversidge, performed on Saturday by more than 500 singers from community choirs across London. Tate Modern's relaunch is accompanied by a complete rehang of the gallery's artworks which showcase more than 300 artists from about 50 countries. Half of the solo displays are dedicated to women artists.",A record number of people have visited the new Tate Modern in London in its opening weekend.
"He was there as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps (AAC), which provides air support to soldiers on the ground. Two squadrons from 4 Regiment AAC completed a four-month tour of duty in January operating Apache helicopters. Prince Charles presented 35 operational service medals, three for long service and good conduct and one meritorious service medal. He said: ""Having visited Afghanistan last March and having seen something of [Camp] Bastion, I at least have a vague idea of the sort of conditions you're enduring and putting up with. ""I had to be shown how to strap myself in and get used to what goes on in the aircraft by my youngest son. 'Very proud' ""The trouble was that I found out very quickly that I'm past my sell-by date on the instrumentation and just about everything else, because I haven't had the advantage of being part of the Playstation generation which, I suspect, is a vital need as far as flying the Apache is concerned. ""But, I did at least discover just what an extraordinarily sophisticated and remarkable machine it is."" Warrant Officer Class 1 Martyn Leadbetter, who received a meritorious service medal and is about to leave the army, said: ""You're nominated by your chain of command, you then go to the medals board and, if you're lucky enough, your name is listed in the Queen's honours list.

"The former News of the World editor resigned from his Downing Street role in January 2011 amid a row about phone hacking at the News of the World (NoW). In his witness statement , he said he only considered a possible conflict of interest over the shares after he quit. There was no ""grand conspiracy"" between the government and the media, he said. Asked if he had seen any contact between Prime Minister David Cameron and the media he regarded as too close, he said: ""I look at it from the perspective of whether or not there was improper conversations or a deal done, which I think is all part of this sort of grand conspiracy that sort of sits over this idea. ""I never saw a conversation, was party to a conversation that to my mind was inappropriate in that way."" Mr Coulson said he had been troubled by what he saw as a suggestion at the inquiry that ""friendship is always based on some ulterior motive"". Potential for conflict Speaking of his share holding, Mr Coulson said in his statement: ""Since resigning from my role as Downing Street communications director l have given thought to one issue which I now accept could have raised the potential for conflict."" Mr Coulson added: ""I was never asked about any share or stock holdings and because I knew that I wasn't involved in any commercial issues, including the BSkyB bid, it never occurred to me that there could be a conflict of interest."" In his witness statement, he said: ""In retrospect I wish I had paid more attention to it."" Mr Coulson told the inquiry he could not remember dealing with communications issues from the BSkyB bid other than the Daily Telegraph's revelation that Business Secretary Vince Cable suggested he was ""going to war"" on Mr Murdoch. The prime minister's official spokesman said it had been Mr Coulson's responsibility to declare the share holding when he started working for Mr Cameron, in compliance with the Civil Service Code. BBC correspondent Robin Brant said it would have been the then permanent secretary at Downing Street, Jeremy Heywood, who would have ultimately been responsible for ensuring compliance. In other evidence: Mr Coulson resigned as editor of the NoW in January 2007 after its royal reporter, Clive Goodman, was jailed for illegally accessing the voicemail of three Buckingham Palace officials. He became Mr Cameron's director of communications while the Tories were in opposition in May 2007. He moved into government when the coalition was formed in May 2010 and resigned in January 2011, blaming ongoing coverage of the phone-hacking scandal. 'Elephant in the room' Chancellor George Osborne first approached him to ask how he thought the party could get elected, Mr Coulson said. ""I went into it with a degree of reluctance. I wasn't thinking about politics at all. I gave an outline of what the party needed to do,"" he said. Mr Coulson said Mr Osborne had ""maybe"" asked about his links to News International but denied inquiry counsel Robert Jay QC's assertion that it was ""the elephant in the room"". The prime minister has repeatedly defended his appointment of Mr Coulson, who has always said he knew nothing about phone hacking under his editorship of the NoW. Mr Coulson told the inquiry the subject of jailed royal editor Clive Goodman did come up during further talks he had with senior Tories about taking the job. The subject also came up in a conversation with Mr Cameron. ""I was able to repeat what I had said publicly, that I knew nothing about the Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire case in terms of what they did,"" he told the inquiry. He said he had explained his background ""should not be seen as some sort of guarantee"" of the support of the NoW or the Sun. Frustration Mr Coulson said they had tried to talk to as many newspapers as possible as the Tories had an ""electoral mountain"" to climb. The PM ""frequently"" expressed frustration about the amount of time he needed to spend with figures from the media, Mr Coulson said. Mr Coulson revealed that he attended meetings of the national security council during his time as director of communications. Mr Cameron's spokesman said it would have been Mr Heywood's responsibility to allow Mr Coulson access to the most top secret information even though he did not have the top level of security clearance, known as developed vetting (DV). The spokesman said Mr Coulson had not received DV as the permanent secretary had made a ""conscious decision to reduce the number of people"" who had that level of security clearance. ""Security-checked people have top secret sight occasionally"", he said, adding: ""Some people need to see some top secret material sometimes."" Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks is due to give evidence on Friday. Both she and Mr Coulson have been arrested and bailed as part of Operation Weeting - the Met Police's investigation into phone hacking at the now-closed tabloid. They have also been arrested and bailed as part of the investigation into corrupt payments to public officials, Operation Elveden, which is being overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Inquiry lawyers will not be allowed to ask Mr Coulson or Mrs Brooks any questions that could prejudice the police investigation into phone hacking or any future trials.","Andy Coulson has told the Leveson Inquiry he held shares in News Corporation worth £40,000 while working as the prime minister's press chief."

"The new gadget toy appears to be selling like hotcakes in China - much to the horror of concerned parents across the country. The tiny crossbows fire toothpicks powerful enough to break cardboard, apples or even soda cans. Some cities worried the toys can cause serious injury have now banned them. According to Chinese media, cities like Chengdu, Kunming and Harbin have already banned sales of the toy, while parents in Hong Kong are also raising concerns. The small crossbows come as a cheap plastic version for about four yuan (£0.5; $0.6) while the metal versions of the mini weapon cost around 10 yuan. They are sold in shops and on the streets near schools and are also available online. Still available online Reacting to criticism from parents, the country's leading online platforms JD.com and Taobao.com have said they won't allow the toys to be sold any more. While they are indeed no longer available on those two online shops, they can still be found on other websites like 1688.com, which like Taobao belongs to online retail giant Alibaba. According to Chinese media, police are also cracking down on shops near schools selling the dangerous gadgets. Videos on social media showing the crossbows in action have them breaking into cardboard, apples or raw meat. If the toothpick is replaced with a metal needle, it can even crack through a can of soda. While the toys do come with a note saying they should not be aimed at people or animals, the packaging of one product claims it can even fight cockroaches, which many might say is no bad thing.","If you think fidget spinners can be dangerous toys, wait until you come across a kid playing with a toothpick crossbow - and then take cover."
"The company currently shares ad revenue with video-makers who are enrolled in its partnership scheme, when it shows ads before or during their content. But YouTube says it will start putting ads on some videos from channels that are not part of its partnership scheme. Changes to its terms of service mean YouTube will not share the revenue from those ads with the video-makers. It could also mean viewers see a higher number of adverts across the site. YouTube's Partner Programme is something that has to be applied for, and is only available to channels that have more than 1,000 subscribers and have clocked up 4,000 hours of people watching in a year. YouTube said channels not in the programme would not ""receive a share of the revenue from these ads"" though the makers would have the opportunity to apply for YPP as normal if they met the eligibility requirements. But YouTube's own explanation of the application process says applications are put in a queue to be reviewed by humans, which can take more than a month. ""This could mean that a smaller creator who isn't part of the programme gains viral success without receiving any ad revenue from it,"" said journalist and author Chris Stokel-Walker. While a creator might be able to spin that success into other income - such as sponsorships and appearances - the decision seems strange, he said. ""YouTube's already making inordinately large amounts of money,"" he explained. ""It's another policy change that seems likely to rankle with ordinary creators, who have often felt aggrieved that YouTube capitalises on their content without properly compensating them - or recognising their contribution to the success of the platform."" 'More ads' That seems to be the case online. Some YouTubers have accused the company of moving the goalposts on its ad policies. Others suggested that putting ads on all videos, regardless of earning potential, may be an attempt to push viewers to pay for YouTube's £11.99 a month ad-free premium product. ""Seems like a hard push to force more ads on users,"" one user on the help forum wrote. ""May have some negative effects, especially for users who can't afford to pay for YT premium service."" Another added: ""There is simply no other way to view this than YouTube telling its creator base that they're happy to make money off the back of work that certain creators aren't seeing a penny for themselves."" The changes are being rolled out in the United States, with YouTube saying the new terms will ""become available"" for creators elsewhere next year. But despite the backlash, Stokel-Walker said the site was unlikely to change its mind. ""The sheer number of creators trying to become popular on YouTube means there's always someone else willing to replace an unhappy creator who wants out,"" he said.",YouTube says it will start showing adverts on more videos - but won't necessarily pay the video-maker a cut.
"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Father Alexander Goryachev has boarded a plane every September since 2006 to mark the Russian Orthodox Church's Day of Sobriety, and flown over Tver armed with icons in the hope of tutoring his flock in the waves of righteousness, the Tver News site reports. But this year he and the local Bishop Savva decided extra measures were needed, and poured 70 litres of specially-sanctified water over the city from their creaky light aircraft - accompanied by the 19th century icon of the Inexhaustible Chalice that Orthodox believers maintain can heal alcoholics and drug addicts. ""I want my prayers to protect the city from the afflictions befalling it, from all accidents and social adversity,"" Bishop Savva told Tver News ahead of the flight. 'Confirmed success stories' Fr Alexander is convinced his previous flights have won real victories over alcoholism. ""A man saw our plane flying over head, and told his wife there and then that he would give up the drink - and he did,"" he told viewers while holding the icon. The airborne priest believes all physical ailments have a spiritual root - ""Every illness is caused by a virus, and viruses are demons. That's why every illness is first and foremost a spiritual illness"". A man called Vyacheslav endorsed this view. He said he managed to quit the drink after turning to the Inexhaustible Chalice icon for help during a pilgrimage to Tver - on which he also met his future wife Olga. They both joined the clerics on the latest flight over Tver. You may also be interested in: Fr Alexander insisted that the holy water had to be poured from a chalice, not the instrument called an aspergillum that priests use in church.

""Laugh if you must, you'll live longer. But what are you laughing at? Our efforts to help people heal themselves and stop drinking, taking drugs and fornicating?""

"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has over-ruled an inspector's recommendation to reject the Tithebarn shopping development. The move had been opposed by neighbouring councils Blackburn and Blackpool who saw it as a threat to their own trading future. But Mr Pickles said the development would not adversely effect the towns. The Tithebarn scheme plans include large-scale demolition and re-building work, creating a John Lewis store, a new bus station and a revamped market. A bid by English Heritage to save the 1960s bus station failed earlier this year. Blackburn Council had claimed the development could take away vital ""footfall"" from its businesses. Blackpool said Tithebarn could be a ""major threat"" to the resort. But Mr Pickles said he agreed with the planning inspector that ""neither Blackpool nor Blackburn town centre is so weak that it could not cope with some impact"". He said the proposal ""would not undermine any existing committed or planned investments, or have any significant adverse impact on the vitality, viability or turnover"" of other towns. Councillor Ken Hudson, leader of Preston City Council, said the council was delighted at the decision. ""The minister has clearly seen sense and on balance agreed that the development is in the best interests of Preston, Lancashire and the North West as a whole,"" he added. ""We all recognise that there is a lot of hard work ahead but getting planning permission is a huge boost for Tithebarn and a huge boost for Preston,"" said Mr Hudson.",A £700m plan to revolutionise Preston city centre has been given government approval.
"The government had announced a $0.20 (£0.16) daily charge on voice calls made through WhatsApp and other apps. But it scrapped the plans hours later amid clashes between security forces and protesters. Thousands have protested, calling on the government to step down over its handling of an economic crisis. Dozens were reported injured on Thursday as protesters burned tyres and security forces fired tear gas. The demonstrations were the biggest seen in Lebanon for years. On Friday, Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said the country was going through an ""unprecedented, difficult time"" but stopped short of resigning. He issued a 72-hour deadline to his ""partners in government"" to stop blocking reforms. Why are people protesting in Lebanon? Thousands of Lebanese people have taken to the streets amid an economic crisis that many blame on the government. ""I was sitting at home and I saw the people on the move and so I came out,"" Cezar Shaaya, an accountant protesting in Beirut, told Reuters news agency. ""I am married, I have mortgage payments due every month and I am not working. It's the state's fault."" Chants of ""the people want to topple the regime"" echoed around Beirut's Riad al-Solh square on Thursday. Many also expressed anger over perceived inaction by authorities to tackle the country's worst wildfires in decades. What about the WhatsApp tax? On Thursday, the government announced a new daily tax for calls made via voice-over-internet-protocol (Voip), which is used by apps including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple's FaceTime. The government backtracked hours later, but the protests continued. ""We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything,"" said Abdullah, a protester in Beirut.",Protests raged for a second day in Lebanon despite the government backtracking on plans to tax WhatsApp calls.
"When news emerged that some of the Chibok schoolgirls, abducted by Boko Haram in 2014, had declined to return home with the batch of 82 freed in May, the world found it difficult to believe. Not even the release of a Boko Haram video showing some hijab-clad, Kalashnikov-wielding girls saying they were happy in their new lives, was enough to convince people. ""They must have been coerced,"" some said. ""It must be Stockholm syndrome,"" others said. What else could explain why any girl, any woman, would choose to remain with such horrible men? Yet, some women rescued by the Nigerian military from captivity are willingly returning to Boko Haram's Sambisa forest hideout in north-eastern Nigeria to be with these same horrible men. 'Fairytale life' In January, I met Aisha Yerima, 25, who was kidnapped by Boko Haram more than four years ago. While in captivity, she got married to a commander who showered her with romance, expensive gifts and Arabic love songs. The fairytale life in the Sambisa forest she described to me was suddenly cut short by the appearance of the Nigerian military in early 2016, at a time her husband had gone off to battle with other commanders. When I first interviewed Aisha, she had been in government custody for about eight months, and completed a de-radicalisation programme run by psychologist Fatima Akilu, the executive director of the Neem Foundation and founder of the Nigerian government's de-radicalisation programme. ""I now see that all the things Boko Haram told us were lies,"" Aisha said. ""Now, when I listen to them on the radio, I laugh."" The pull of power? But, in May, less than five months after being released into the care of her family in north-eastern Maiduguri city, she returned to the forest hideout of Boko Haram. Over the past five years, Dr Akilu has worked with former Boko Haram members - including some commanders, their wives and children - and with hundreds of women who were rescued from captivity. ""How women were treated when in Boko Haram captivity depends on which camp a woman was exposed to. It depends on the commander running the camp,"" she said. ""Those who were treated better were the ones who willingly married Boko Haram members or who joined the group voluntarily and that's not the majority. Most women did not have the same treatment."" Aisha had boasted to me about the number of slaves she had while in the Sambisa forest, the respect she received from other Boko Haram commanders, and the strong influence she had over her husband. She even accompanied him to battle once. ""These were women who for the most part had never worked, had no power, no voice in the communities, and all of a sudden they were in charge of between 30 to 100 women who were now completely under their control and at their beck and call,"" Dr Akilu said. ""It is difficult to know what to replace it with when you return to society because most of the women are returning to societies where they are not going to be able to wield that kind of power."" Still in shock Apart from loss of power, other reasons Dr Akilu believes could lead women to willingly return to Boko Haram include stigmatisation from a community which treats them like pariahs because of their association with the militants, and tough economic conditions. ""De-radicalisation is just one part of it. Reintegration is also a part of it. Some of them have no livelihood support built around them,"" Dr Akilu said. ""The kind of support you have in de-radicalisation programmes does not follow you when you leave. They often come out successful from de-radicalisation programmes but they struggle in the community and it is that struggle that often leads them to go back,"" she said. Recently, I visited Aisha's family, who were still in shock at her departure and worried about her wellbeing. Her mother, Ashe, recalled at least seven former Boko Haram ""wives"" she knew, all friends of her daughter, who had returned to the Sambisa forest long before her daughter did. ""Each time one of them disappeared, her family came to our house to ask Aisha if she had heard from their daughter,"" she said. ""That's how I knew."" Some of the women kept in touch with Aisha after they returned to Boko Haram. Her younger sister, Bintu, was present during at least two phone calls. ""They told her to come and join them but she refused,"" Bintu said. ""She told them she didn't want to go back."" Life on track? Unlike some former Boko Haram ""wives"" I've met, who are either struggling to survive harsh economic conditions or dealing with stigma, Aisha's life seemed to be on track. She was earning money from buying and selling fabric, regularly attending social events and posting photos of herself all primped up on social media, and had a string of suitors. ""At least five different men wanted to marry her,"" her mother said, pointing out that there could be no greater form of acceptance shown to a woman, and presenting this as evidence that her daughter faced no stigma whatsoever from the community. ""One of the men lives in Lagos. She was thinking of marrying him,"" she said. But, everything went awry when Aisha received yet another phone call from the women who had returned to the forest, informing her that her Boko Haram ""husband"" was now with a woman who had been her rival. From that day, the vivacious and gregarious Aisha became a recluse. ""She stopped going out or talking or eating,"" Bintu said. ""She was always sad."" Two weeks later, she left home and did not return. Some of her clothes were missing. Her phones were switched off. She took the two-year-old son fathered by the commander in the Sambisa forest, but left the older one she had with the husband she divorced before her abduction. ""De-radicalisation is complicated by the fact that we have an active, ongoing insurgency. In cases where a group has reached settlement with the government and laid down their arms, it is easier,"" Dr Akilu said. ""But, when you have fathers, husbands, sons still in the movement, they want to be reunited, especially women."" Asta, another former Boko Haram ""wife"", told me that she has heard of the many women returning to the group, but has no plans to do so herself. However, the 19-year-old described how terribly she misses her husband, and how keen she is to hear from him and to be reunited with him. She insisted that she would not return to the forest, not even if he were to ask her. ""I will tell him to come and stay here with us and live a normal life,"" she said. But as with Aisha, the desire to be with the man she yearns for may turn out to be more compelling for Asta than the aversion to a group responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in north-east Nigeria, and for the displacement of millions who are struggling to survive in refugee camps.

"The Taliban said its militants had been ordered to take up arms again on Sunday night - now the Eid festival had ended. The government says it will continue a unilateral ceasefire for another 10 days, although security forces can defend themselves if attacked. There were unprecedented scenes of soldiers and Taliban insurgents hugging each other during the ceasefire. But the ceasefire failed to end violence entirely. At least 18 people were killed in a suicide attack in the city of Jalalabad, outside the office of the governor of Nangarhar province while officials were meeting Taliban insurgents. Dozens were injured. No group said it carried out the attack. On Saturday a suicide bombing in the same province, also on a gathering of Taliban and local officials, left 36 people dead. The Islamic State group said it carried out that attack. What have the Taliban said? The militants said there would be no extension to the ceasefire and fighters would be expected to leave government-controlled areas before sunset. In a statement, the Taliban said it had called the ceasefire to enable ordinary Afghans to enjoy a peaceful Eid, ""not in response to the ceasefire of the Kabul regime"". The group hailed the success of the ceasefire as a sign of its cohesion, and reasserted its determination to seek the ""withdrawal of foreign invaders and establishment of an Islamic government"". President Ashraf Ghani's plea on Saturday for the Taliban to prolong its truce has been rejected. His office said on Sunday that the government's extended truce would still allow Afghan security forces to ""defend themselves against any attack"". What happened over the holiday? In extraordinary scenes during Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on Saturday, militants embraced security force members and took selfies with citizens. Both sides had declared a three-day truce for the occasion. In his announcement on Saturday, President Ghani appealed to the militants to follow the government's lead and enter peace talks. During the ceasefire, Taliban militants were able to receive medical and humanitarian assistance and Taliban prisoners could see their families, he added. The government also released some Taliban prisoners, he said. How did the ceasefire come about? The Taliban announced the three-day halt to hostilities earlier this month, days after a unilateral ceasefire was ordered by the government. It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. ""It was the most peaceful Eid. For the first time we felt safe. It is hard to describe the joy,"" said Qais Liwal, a student in Zabul in southern Afghanistan. In February Mr Ghani offered peace talks ""without preconditions"" and recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political group if they respected the rule of law. Tens of thousands of Afghans have been killed since the US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power in 2001.",A widely welcomed three-day ceasefire between security forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan appears to be over.
"Meals must include one or more portions of vegetables or salad every day and no more than two portions of fried foods or pastry-based foods each week. The rules promote drinking water and limit fruit juice servings to 150ml. The new regulations are mandatory for local authority schools, new free schools and schools that convert to academy status. They stipulate: Details of the new school food plan were unveiled by ministers in June, following a review of school meals by founders of the Leon food chain John Vincent and Henry Dimbleby. In July 2012, the then-Education Secretary, Michael Gove, asked the restaurateurs to examine nutrition in England's schools and see how it could be improved. The new regulations are in response to those findings and replace ones introduced in the wake of a campaign by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to improve the standard of food in schools. Mr Oliver led a successful campaign to ban junk and processed food from school canteens and tight nutritional guidelines were brought in. However, he expressed frustration at the time that academy schools were exempt from these rules. Academy exemption Under the new school food plan, academies established before 2010 or after June 2014 are obliged to follow the standards set out. But those founded between 2010 and June 2014 remain exempt. The Department for Education said these schools were being encouraged to sign up to the plan voluntarily and hundreds had already done so. The department said the previous rules had done ""much to improve school food"" but ""were complicated and expensive to enforce"". The revised regulations were intended to give school cooks more ""flexibility"", it said. Dr Patricia Mucavele, head of nutrition at the Children's Food Trust, welcomed the new standards, saying variety was key. ""We tested the new standards with the people who would be using them - school caterers and cooks,"" she said. ""They told us the new standards were easier and more intuitive to use to plan interesting and creative menus, which has got to be great news for children and school food.""","New rules for school meals in England will come into force next week, at the beginning of the new term."
"Her party is making a deal with the Conservatives to keep them in power. Mrs Foster has plenty of experience of unlikely political marriages, having spent years in coalition government with unionism's long term political opponents, Sinn Féin. Given that the IRA once tried to murder her father, she knows more than most about political compromises. The DUP's deal with the Tories is likely to fall well short of a formal coalition - Mrs Foster's party is more likely to prop up a minority Conservative government. However, the opportunity to play a role at the heart of the UK government comes after a very difficult few months closer to home for the DUP leader, For many years, Mrs Foster was viewed as a strong and capable government minister, whose traumatic personal experiences shaped her passion for the unionist cause. She became leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in December 2015 and, the following month, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster is the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs. But she lost her job as first minister of Northern Ireland in January after Sinn Féin pulled the plug on their power-sharing coalition at Stormont in protest at her role in a controversial green energy scheme. Dubbed the ""cash-for-ash"" scandal, the cost of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme she set up in 2012 spiralled out of control and saddled taxpayers with a multi-million pound bill. The controversy brought both her leadership, and the very future of Stormont, into doubt. Born Arlene Kelly in 1970, Mrs Foster grew up on a farm in rural County Fermanagh, close to the Irish border. Her mother hailed from Belfast's Sandy Row while her father, farmer John Kelly, was also a reservist police officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The Troubles played a significant role in her childhood - when she was eight years old, the IRA attempted to kill her father by shooting him outside their family home. ""My father came in on all fours crawling, with blood coming from his head,"" Mrs Foster told the Belfast Telegraph in 2015. Mr Kelly survived the attack, but the family was forced to sell their farm and move away, under a government scheme set up for Troubles victims under threat. But leaving their home did not stop the attacks. About 10 years later, the IRA set off a bomb on her school bus. The target of the attack was the bus driver, who was also a part-time soldier in the Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The teenage Arlene Kelly was not hurt in the explosion, but a schoolgirl sitting next to her was seriously injured. 'Don't panic' Interviewed by BBC News in the aftermath of the bombing, the young Arlene said: ""Gillian fell on top of me, sideways, and then there was about two or three seconds silence. ""Then everybody started to scream, I got up and said: 'Don't panic, don't panic'... Everybody get out'. ""Ernie, the bus driver, was coming down, helping us all get out and Gillian said 'I can't move' and that's when I saw her arm; it was completely covered in blood."" When she left grammar school in Enniskillen, the future Mrs Foster became the first member of her family to go to university, taking a law degree at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB). She became politically active at university, joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and becoming chair of QUB Ulster Unionist Association. After university, she qualified as a solicitor and began working in private practice in Enniskillen and Portadown, County Armagh. On 24 August 1995, at the age of 25, she a married a nephew of the veteran UUP politician, Sam Foster. The couple went on to have three children. In 2003, Mrs Foster was elected as a UUP Assembly member for her home constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. However, she vehemently opposed the Good Friday Agreement and the following year, she defected to Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The DUP quickly recognised her as an asset and Mrs Foster was appointed environment minister when the party entered government with Sinn Féin in 2007. 'On time and on budget' The following year she was appointed minister of enterprise, trade and investment - a role she would hold for the next seven years, staying in post throughout Northern Ireland's deepest economic downturn through to the beginning of its recovery. One of the highlights of her Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) ministry was the opening of the Titanic Belfast - which has earned a reputation as one of the world's leading tourist attractions. The £77m exhibition centre was delivered on time and on budget, facts that she emphasised at its official opening. An indication of just how highly she was regarded by her party came in early 2010. The then DUP leader, Peter Robinson, stood aside as first minister for a few weeks in the aftermath of a financial controversy, following his wife Iris's affair with a teenage businessman.. He appointed Mrs Foster to replace him on a temporary basis, while he was investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing relating to his wife's business dealings. When Mr Robinson returned to his job, Mrs Foster enhanced her reputation as his key ally, often accompanying him to significant meetings and news conferences. And during rocky times, she was frequently the party's first choice to go on the airwaves. She had proved herself in high-profile government roles, and when Mr Robinson resigned as first minister in late 2015, Mrs Foster was elected unopposed as his successor. The mother-of-three passed her first electoral test in May 2016, when the DUP consolidated its position as the largest party in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin and the SDLP both lost seats in the 2016 poll, while her former party, the UUP, failed to challenge her dominance as the voice of mainstream unionism. The following month, Mrs Foster was on the winning side of the Brexit debate when the UK voted to leave the European Union. However, her critics, including Sinn Féin, regularly point out that 56% of the Northern Ireland electorate voted to remain in the EU. 'Money to burn' As first minister, she took a strong stand against terrorism, but her office has faced questions after it gave almost £2m to a community organisation led by a man with recent loyalist paramilitary links. In October 2016, Mrs Foster was photographed alongside with Charter NI's chief executive, Dee Stitt, who is also a leading member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Days later, Mr Stitt launched a foul-mouthed attack on the government in a Guardian newspaper interview, vowing to ""defend north Down against anybody"". Mrs Foster said he had become a ""distraction"" to Charter NI's community work, but did not add her voice to calls for Mr Stitt to step down as its chief executive. Mr Stitt has previous challenged allegations that he was a UDA leader. In December 2016, Mrs Foster found herself at the centre of a controversial green energy scheme, the so-called cash-for-ash scandal. The aim of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was to encourage businesses to switch to renewable fuel systems, such as wood pellet burners. Mrs Foster launched it in 2012 when she was Stormont's economy minister. However, a lack of cost controls and overly generous subsidies meant boiler owners could profit from the scheme - the more fuel they burned, the more money they earned. A whistleblower claimed the subsidy scheme was being abused, with claims that one farmer aimed to collect about £1m over 20 years for heating an empty shed - fuelling ""money to burn"" claims. It was never proven. The whistleblower wrote to Mrs Foster to report her concerns, and the then DETI minister passed the details to her officials for investigation, but the scheme continued to operate. RHI was closed to new applicants in February 2016 by Mrs Foster's successor in the DETI department, DUP minister Jonathan Bell. But in an extraordinary interview with the BBC 10 months later, Mr Bell broke ranks to claim Mrs Foster and two top DUP advisers tried to prevent him from shutting it down earlier. Mr Bell also claimed that Mrs Foster was verbally abusive when she ""overruled"" his attempt to close the scheme. In response, Mrs Foster apologised for the lack of cost controls in the RHI scheme but denied any wrongdoing. Despite being shut to new claimants, payments continue to be made to boiler owners whose RHI applications were approved before the scheme was closed. As a result, it was projected that more than £1bn of public money was to due to be paid out by the UK government over the next 20 years - with £490m coming from Stormont's block grant. Cost controls have since been introduced for 2017/18 which will greatly reduce that amount, but RHI recipients who will lose out are set to challenge cost-cutting measure in the courts later this year. The DUP leader faced calls for her resignation when the full implications of RHI were made public, but she resisted saying she had done nothing wrong. Sinn Féin then demanded that she step aside temporarily for an inquiry to take place, and when she refused, the late Martin McGuiness resigned as deputy first minister. The nature of their joint office meant that when he quit, she lost her job as first minister. The collapse of the coalition government in January 2017 meant Northern Ireland's secretary of state had to call a snap assembly election. During a bitter, and in her own words ""brutal"" election campaign, Mrs Foster repeatedly warned unionist voters that Sinn Féin could overtake the DUP as the biggest party at Stormont. 'Absolute disaster' Controversially, she compared Sinn Féin to a ""crocodile"" that would keep coming back for more when she was asked about their demand for an Irish Language Act. The reptilian insult resonated with republicans, with some commentators suggesting her remarks galvanised the Sinn Féin vote. In the end, the DUP won the election and retained their place as the biggest party at Stormont. However, Sinn Féin snapped at their heels, narrowing the gap to a single assembly seat and 1,168 first preference votes. Perhaps more significantly, the result brought an end to unionists' overall majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The SDLP overtook the Ulster Unionist Party for the first time, and nationalists now hold the same number of seats as unionists, in Stormont, with non-aligned parties holding the balance of power. Author and academic Prof Jon Tonge, who has written a book about the DUP, called the assembly election an ""absolute disaster for unionism"". ""They may never, ever regain their overall majority in Stormont. So, from going from a very powerful position only last May 2016, suddenly unionism is in crisis."" Mrs Foster remained in post as DUP leader, but appeared to adopted a more conciliatory tone. In April, she spoke in the Irish language for the first time at a school in Newry, County Down. Meeting staff and students at Our Lady's Grammar School, the DUP leader used the phrase ""go raibh maith agat"" [thank you] in a visit filled with political symbolism. However, week of talks between Stormont's biggest parties continued in deadlock, with Sinn Féin reiterating their demand that Mrs Foster step down or face another assembly poll. After the Easter recess, Prime Minister Theresa May pulled the rug from under all UK parties by calling a snap Westminster election. The shock move meant that the talks were put on hold during campaigning. The results of the Westminster vote further polarised politics in Northern Ireland, with the DUP and Sinn Féin carving up the map between them, with the exception of a single seat. Centre-ground parties - the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) - were wiped out at Westminster, losing all their seats. Mrs Foster hailed the result, saying unionist voters had responded to a ""wake-up call"" after losing their majority in the last assembly vote. However, it was the loss of another majority - that of the Conservative Party - which catapulted Mrs Foster into a position of considerable influence. After it became clear that Theresa May was a handful of seats short of a government, the DUP's 10 MPs suddenly became very important indeed. The party's website crashed on the day after the poll as a result of a surge of interest and the DUP became the most searched term on Google. Critics of the Mrs Foster's deal with the Tories expressed concern over they price the prime minister might have to pay to stay in power. National newspapers were scathing about some of the DUP's more controversial policies, including its opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly have voted five times on whether or not to introduce same-sex marriage, and on the fifth time of asking, in November 2015, they voted in favour by a slim majority of 53 votes to 52. However, the DUP then used a Stormont veto, known as a petition of concern, to block the motion and prevent any change in the law. Discussing the move the following year, Mrs Foster insisted her party was not anti-gay and claimed they had been the target of ""very, very vicious"" abuse on social media by some gay rights supporters. She said: ""Do they seriously think they are going to influence me by sending me abuse? ""No, they are not going to influence me by sending me abuse - in fact, they are going to send me in the opposite direction and people need to reflect on that."" Last weekend, her party became the target of some piercing satire on social media as the UK public at large wondered who their government was considering going into partnership with. However, the DUP leader, who refers to Westminster as the ""mother of parliaments"" has vowed to act in the ""national interest"".","Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), could be about to become the second most important person in British politics."

"The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that the unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 64 rose by 0.1% to 4.6%. This was higher than the the UK-wide rate of 4.1%. The proportion of people in employment was up slightly at 74.3%. The latest figures actually show very little change when you consider how much churn we all know there has been in the labour market. They do not reflect how big that churn has been because the Job Retention scheme, which we also know as the furlough scheme, has kept an awful lot of people technically in employment but not working. In the UK-wide figures out today, we see that towards the end of July there was a rise in unemployment. That was the point where the cost of the Job Retention scheme to employers went up. The scheme should finish at the end of October. That is the point where we are going to see the figures change quite dramatically. The expectation is that by the end of the year we could be moving up from a unemployment rate in Scotland of 4.6% to somewhere between 8% and 12%. While this looks really grim by any comparison we have seen before there is a fundamental strength to a lot of businesses who are in trouble. If we can get through this and out the other side with these companies intact then we could start hiring again pretty fast. But this is clearly a very tough time in the meantime. The Scottish government's Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said the figures did not reflect the full impact of the coronavirus lockdown as the furlough scheme had offered some relief to employers and employees. Mr Hepburn said the Scottish government's recent programme for government had been focused on protecting and renewing the country's labour market. He added: ""We continue to call on the UK government to also play its part and extend the Job Retention Scheme, particularly for sectors such as travel, tourism and hospitality that face significant long-term challenges, likely to remain when the scheme ends next month."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the UK government had done ""everything possible"" to support people through this difficult time. He said: ""Through the furlough scheme, the UK government has supported more than 930,000 Scottish jobs, a third of the workforce, and we are taking decisive action though our ambitious Plan for Jobs.""

""They say things like 'there were better candidates' or 'we have had 1,000 people apply for this role',"" Sophie says. ""It just sounds like it will only get worse."" Sophie was originally applying for jobs she really wanted but is now trying for anything she thinks she might have a chance of getting. ""I am still getting rejected,"" she says. ""Every time I find something I might be interested in I still have a bit of hope but that hope is quickly disintegrating."" Sophie says her generation are not being treated fairly over coronavirus, both being blamed for spreading it and suffering from its economic effects.

She says there is not enough help to get young people into employment. ""One job required eight years' experience for an entry level job,"" she says. ""All my friends are in the same position as me. I don't know many people who it has worked out that well for."" Sophie says that all her friends wanted to work after graduation from university. She says: ""We have got new ideas and we are passionate and we have not been jaded by 50 years of working yet so I think giving us a chance could be a really good thing.""","The number of unemployed people in Scotland increased slightly to 128,000 in the three months to July, according to new statistics."
"The new initiative aims to improve prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment and aftercare for cancer patients in Scotland. An action plan covering the next five to ten years has been drawn up, including funding for new equipment. Health Secretary Shona Robison said the strategy was ""a blueprint for the future of cancer services in Scotland"". The Beating Cancer: Ambition and Action plan lists more than 50 steps being taken, including £50m towards radiotherapy equipment and support for staff recruitment and training. It will also see £9m spent over five years to improve support for cancer patients and their families through link workers and charity groups, and £7.5m for improvements in surgical treatments. Diagnosis is also being targeted, with £5m to reduce inequalities in screening uptake and £10m to support quick access to diagnostics for people who suspect they have cancer. Ms Robison said: ""Cancer services have come a long way over the past ten years, with cancer mortality rates down 11%, however we know more needs to be done. ""Through this strategy we are aiming to reduce health inequalities and improve the experience of and outcomes for people with cancer across Scotland. ""A cancer diagnosis is a daunting prospect for those affected and their families, which is why it is vital that we support people throughout their journey, right from detection through to aftercare."" 'Ambitious measures' The plan was welcomed by a wide range of cancer research and support groups. Gregor McNie of Cancer Research UK said: ""The continued focus on early diagnosis is vital - funds to make sure all patients get the diagnostic tests they need should ensure they are treated without delay. ""Overall, the commitments outlined in this strategy are good news for patients, and we'll closely monitor their implementation to make sure they become a reality."" Janice Preston of Macmillan Cancer Support said: ""We urgently need cancer support to be built around the needs of the individual, and look forward to working with the Scottish government to look in detail at how the ambitious measures outlined in the plan will be achieved. Scottish Labour also welcomed the Scottish government taking ""action on cancer"", but equality spokeswoman Jenny Marra said the plans had been ""delayed by over a year"". She said: ""The facts show that the performance of the government on cancer simply has not been good enough. We have seen declining performance on cancer waiting times, worrying trends in screening and diagnosis, especially in poorer areas. ""While we welcome many of the initiatives in this report, there is little here to address the underlying issues of public health, and health inequalities, both of which are directly linked to cancer.""",The Scottish government has launched a new £100m strategy to tackle cancer.
"Retired Pacific Investment Management Company (Pimco) chief Douglas Hodge paid nearly $1m in bribes to get four of his children into top US colleges. Hodge has received the longest sentence of the high-profile parents convicted so far. Prosecutors called him one of the ""most culpable"" of the 35 parents charged. In October, Hodge pleaded guilty to money-laundering and fraud. He paid $850,000 (£660,000) in bribes over a decade to have four of his seven children win places at Georgetown University in Washington DC and the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits. Prosecutors say Hodge was also attempting to bribe his way into a seat for a fifth child at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. They had asked for Hodge to serve two years in prison. At the sentencing in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday, Judge Nathaniel Gorton said: ""There is no term in the English language that describes your conduct as well as the Yiddish term 'chutzpah.'"" The judge said he would have given a prison term of a year, as Hodge had participated in the scam repeatedly and for the longest time, but took into consideration Hodge's charity work. Hodge, who retired from his position as Pimco's chief executive in 2016 before the scandal broke, has expressed remorse for his actions. His defence team had argued the ex-CEO deserves a reduced sentence in light of his history of philanthropy. They said he has given more than $30m to causes benefitting children around the world. But prosecutor Justin O'Connell dubbed this the ""height of hypocrisy"". A tearful Hodge said in a prepared apology following the sentencing that ""ego"" or ""status"" did not drive his decision. ""Rather, I was driven by my own transformative educational experiences and my deep parental love."" The US college admissions scandal has seen dozens of defendants indicted for allegedly cheating and bribing to get their children into elite universities, like Yale and Stanford. The parents - many of whom are celebrities or wealthy business executives - allegedly paid a firm as much as $6.5m (£4.9m) to cheat on students' college entrance exams or bribe top coaches to offer fake athletic scholarships. The colleges have not been accused of any wrongdoing and are investigating the matter internally. Fifteen parents are still contesting the allegations, and their trials are expected to take place later this year. US actress Lori Loughlin, of the sitcom Full House is among the 50 total individuals - including coaches and other associates - is charged in the case. So is Michelle Janavs, the heiress to the Hot Pockets (a microwavable snack) fortune. Ms Loughlin and her husband, designer Mossimo Giannuli, allegedly paid $500,000 in bribes to have their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as fake rowing-team recruits. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison and a $30,000 fine last October for paying $15,000 to participate in an exam cheating scam. The ringleader, William ""Rick"" Singer, 58, is co-operating with the authorities. Authorities say the scam earned him $25m between 2011-18 through his firm Edge College & Career Network. Children of wealthy Americans often win places at elite universities after their parents make generous donations, an entirely legal practice.",The former head of a top US investment firm has been sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in the US universities admissions scandal.
"Appalling abuse Prof Jay's report describes the abuse as ""appalling"" and says it included the rape of girls as young as 11 by ""large numbers of male perpetrators"". Children were raped by multiple attackers, trafficked to other towns and cities in the north of England, abducted, beaten and intimidated, the report revealed. Some were doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, while others were threatened with guns, made to watch ""brutally violent rapes"" and warned they would be next if they told anyone. Blatant failures The report said the ""collective failures"" of political and officer leadership were ""blatant"" over the first 12 years covered by the inquiry. Senior managers within social care were said to have ""underplayed"" the scale and seriousness of the problem. Police were said to have given CSE no priority, regarding many child victims ""with contempt"" and failing to act on their abuse as a crime. The report found that three other publications in 2002, 2003 and 2006 provided ""stark evidence"" to the police and council. The first of these was suppressed, which the report said had led to suggestions of a cover-up, while the other two were ignored. Staff were said to have believed the extent of CSE had been exaggerated, while some were ""overwhelmed"" by the numbers of cases involved. Asian perpetrators The majority of those behind the abuse were described as Asian, while the victims were young white girls. Yet the report found that councillors failed to engage with the town's Pakistani-heritage community during the inquiry period. Some councillors were said to have hoped the issue would ""go away"", thinking it was a ""one-off problem"". The report said several staff members were afraid they would be labelled racist if they identified the race of the perpetrators, while others said they were instructed by their managers not to do so. Several councillors interviewed believed highlighting the race element would ""give oxygen"" to racist ideas and threaten community cohesion. Improvements and recommendations Despite identifying ""systemic failings"", the report highlighted ""many improvements"" by the council and police over the past four years. Police have been trained and resourced to deal with CSE, while there was now a central team in children's social care that worked jointly with police on the issue, the report said. It made 15 recommendations in total to Rotherham Council, its partners and the Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board. These included areas involving risk assessment, looked-after children, outreach and accessibility, the joint police and council CSE team, collaboration with Children and Young People Service, ongoing work with victims, post-abuse support, quality assurance, minority ethnic communities and the issue of race, and serious case reviews.","An estimate that 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 is among the key findings of an independent report by Professor Alexis Jay into the handling of child sexual exploitation (CSE) by social services and police in the South Yorkshire town."
"The civic building, which houses a theatre, register office and library, was built 2010 and has so far run over its £35m budget by about £12m. Corby borough councillors will be asked to release funds to cover the costs of the work at a meeting on Tuesday. Norman Stronach, acting chief executive of the council, said it was ""disappointing"". The figure does not include work to complete the building's fourth floor. 'Final one' The report to councillors, which was made by a team that included Mr Stronach, reads: ""It is very disappointing that this request for additional funding toward the Cube is having to be made. ""However, in order to complete the building in its current form it is necessary to increase the budget. ""Officers are keeping these costs as low as possible and it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that this request is the final one in this respect."" It is the latest in a string of problems at the Cube. In May there were problems with the water mains at the building, which led to tap water having a ""yellow tinge"" for four days. A report found the Cube was built with ""dangerous"" design flaws including a staircase described as ""like a helter skelter"", which had to be corrected. The MP for Corby requested a confidential report into the overspend on the building be made public. Conservative Louise Mensch said: ""If there has been failings on this project then the people of Corby have a right to know.""","An estimated £500,000 will be needed to complete Northamptonshire's Corby Cube, council officers have said."
"Leeds Crown Court heard James Carragher was jailed for seven years in 1993 and 14 years in 2004 for sex offences. He denies 50 counts of indecent assault between the 1970s and the 1990s at St William's in Market Weighton, East Riding of Yorkshire. Two other former staff at the home also went on trial earlier. The home for boys with behavioural problems was run by the Catholic De La Salle order. It has since closed. 'Cloak of respectability' Mr Carragher - who was head of St William's from 1976 to 1990 - and two other men are accused of abusing 19 former pupils between them. Opening the case for the prosecution, Richard Wright QC said Mr Carragher was a man who had a ""committed sexual interest in children and young boys in particular"". Mr Wright said: ""He hid behind a cloak of respectability. ""Who would believe the word of a delinquent boy set against those of a respected teacher of a Catholic order,"" Mr Wright added. Mr Carragher went on trial along with former chaplain at St William's, Anthony McCallen, 69, and former teacher Michael Curran, 62. The jury was told how Mr McCallen was convicted of abusing two boys in the 1990s. Mr Curran has no previous convictions, the prosecutor said. Mr Carragher, of Merseyside, denies 12 other serious sexual offences alongside the counts of indecent assault. Mr McCallen, also of Merseyside, denies 18 indecent assaults and seven other serious sexual offences. Mr Curran, of Teesside, denies one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and another of indecent assault. The trial continues.",A convicted sex offender who was a principal at a children's home and school has gone on trial accused of further sex offences against boys.
"Paul Conibeare said they were ""about £50,000 up on the fares budget which is just over £2m"". The county council is currently considering selling off Minehead's West Somerset Railway (WSR), which is run by West Somerset Railway plc. A decision is expected at the end of January. Independent councillor Mike Rigby has said previously that, whatever the outcome, the council needed to be ""very sure that the railway can continue to operate"". He said there was a bid in from the West Somerset Railways Association, a support charity, and a bid from the West Somerset Railway plc. Mr Conibeare said: ""That £2m in sales at the ticket office just about keeps the railway going with the coal, salaries and expenses we have throughout the year. Without that we couldn't survive. ""Any profit we make is reinvested in the business."" He said the heritage line had also been left more than £1.7m over the last five years through people's wills. The 20-mile (32 km) line between Minehead and Taunton was closed by British Railways in 1971 as part of the Beeching cuts. The following year, the council bought the branch line and leased it to the WSR.","The immediate future of a heritage railway in Somerset is secure because of an increase in ticket sales during 2013, its general manager has said."
"Chris Gard and Connie Yates had been expecting their 10-month-old's life support to be turned off on Friday. But Great Ormond Street Hospital said it will continue Charlie's care to allow the family to spend more time with him. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump tweeted his support on Monday. He wrote: ""If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so."" The Vatican said the Pope was following the case ""with affection and sadness"". A statement released on Sunday said the Pope wished to ""expresses his closeness to his [Charlie's] parents"". ""For them he prays, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored,"" it said. Analysis by Nick Triggle, BBC Health correspondent: Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage because he is unable to get energy to his organs. Doctors have said he now cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and has irreversible brain damage. His lungs are only able to keep going because of the treatment he is receiving. They have argued he should be allowed to die with dignity. But his parents and supporters have been fighting for him to be given an experimental treatment in the US. The treatment is not a cure - there isn't one - but it has been suggested it could reduce the effects of the disease. Although doctors in the US have since said the benefits they have seen have not been in cases as advanced as Charlie's. The statement came on the same day demonstrators gathered outside Buckingham Palace to protest against the decision to allow Charlie's life-sustaining treatment to be withdrawn. On 27 June, Charlie's parents lost their final legal appeal to take him to the US for experimental treatment. His parents also said the hospital had denied their final wish to be able to take their son home to die, and felt ""let down"" following the lengthy legal battle. Judges at the European Court of Human Rights concluded that further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"", in line with advice from specialists at Great Ormond Street. President Donald Trump said he would be ""delighted"" to help Charlie after his parents lost their legal battle. A spokeswoman for the White House said President Trump had not spoken to the family although members of the administration had. ""The president is just trying to be helpful if at all possible,"" she added. Doctors have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October 2016. Charlie's parents raised £1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for the experimental treatment in the US. Ms Yates previously indicated the money would go towards a charity for mitochondrial depletion syndrome if Charlie ""did not get his chance"".","Pope Francis has called for the parents of terminally-ill Charlie Gard to be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end""."
"This phase involves replacing the gates at Netham Lock, where boats from the River Avon can gain access to the floating harbour. Built in about 1809, the lock marks the end of the Feeder Canal. Back-up flood gates have already been installed at Junction Lock, and the swing bridge has been upgraded.

"The UK Peace Index, from the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), said the city had the highest rates of homicides and violent crime. The study, which looked at 10 areas, described it as ""the least peaceful major urban centre"", with London and Belfast in second and third place. However, researcher Steve Killelea said Glasgow had become much more peaceful over the past five years. Areas were ranked according to the number of homicides and levels of violent and weapon crime, public disorder and numbers of police officers per 100,000 people. In 2012 there were 2.7 homicides per 100,000 people in Glasgow. This compared to a 1.67 per 100,000 in London and a rate of 1.0 across the UK as a whole. However, in 2007 Glasgow's homicide rate was much higher at about 4.5. IEP founder and chairman Steve Killelea said: ""It's not all bad news for Glasgow. ""If you look over the last decade it's actually more peaceful. ""Homicide rates are down 40%, while violent crime is down roughly 30%."" He compared this to Scotland as a whole, where over the past five years the number of homicides had only fallen by 25%, and violent crime levels cut by 10%. ""So on that basis, Glasgow is outperforming the Scottish average,"" he said. ""But it's coming from a much higher base."" The index put the trend down to an ageing population, a decrease in alcohol consumption, a rise in wages and changes in police practices. The study said continuing problems with gangs and knife crime contributed to Glasgow's rating. Describing the city as was one of the poorest areas in the UK, it said there was a strong link between crime and poverty. Scotland had the highest homicide rate of any of the four UK nations, as well as the highest violent crime rate, at more than 1,500 per 100,000 people, the report said. However, London was rated the most violent region overall. Within Scotland, the Orkney Islands ranked the most peaceful followed by Aberdeenshire and Moray. West Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire were the most violent areas after Glasgow. Ch Supt Bob Hamilton, head of the licensing and violence reduction division for Police Scotland, raised questions over some of the analysis in the report. He said: ""Some of the statistics used in this report are not current and have been recorded, collated and analysed in different ways in each force area so it is difficult to make accurate comparisons."" He pointed to the latest official Scottish crime figures, which showed that from 2010/11 until 2011/12 violent crime in Glasgow and the West of Scotland reduced by 23.4%. He added that a ""stop and search"" approach had helped cut the number of people caught carrying an offensive weapon, and there had been 23% fewer fatal stabbings over the past year.",Glasgow has been ranked as the UK's most violent area in a new report.
"Who, What, WhyThe Magazine answers the questions behind the news Holidays are meant to be a break from the stresses of everyday life - unless you're standing at the airport's baggage carousel an hour after your flight touched down, everyone else has left, and you're facing two weeks on the beach with nothing but the clothes you're wearing. Since 2007, airlines have got better at sending on our luggage to the correct destination. For every 1,000 passengers who fly, there are 7.3 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers today, compared with 18.9 in 2007. But why do our bags disappear in the first place? Around half the bags that go missing disappear because of ""transfer mishandling"" - being moved from one aircraft to another, or across airlines. ""Bags don't tend to run as quickly as passengers,"" notes Nick Gates of SITA, an airline IT company. This is not the only way bags temporarily disappear. A surprising number make their way to the right destination, but are picked up in error by other passengers. ""The world is full of black Samsonite bags,"" Gates notes. And what happens once bags disappear? Passengers tell the airline or airport, and most log the missing bag on World Tracer, a software system used by more than 440 airlines, and other companies dedicated to reuniting lost bags with owners, as well as nearly 3,000 airports. At the same time, the absent bag usually appears somewhere else in the world - either it didn't make it on to the departing flight, was too slow to make a connection and so is stuck in transit, or was mislabelled and ended up at a totally different airport. ""Eventually it will get found by somebody,"" says Gates, ""and they will report it as being found in the World Tracer system."" Tag reference numbers, physical descriptions of the bag and its contents, and other identifying information such as its route before being lost are compared by the system, which then finds a match and reroutes the bag to the owner. But all the computers in the world don't help in some cases. Natalie Robbie, a London-based actress, was travelling from Gatwick to Edinburgh in July 2014. When she arrived in Scotland, her bag was missing. It didn't turn up on any computer system. Robbie pestered the bagging handling companies working at both airports. A baggage handler at Gatwick searched the airport's other lost luggage areas, and found the bag in another airline's collection. ""He took the effort to go and look around,"" Robbie says. ""He didn't just look through a computer system."" ""It's such a stressful thing,"" she admits. ""You don't realise how crazy it makes you not to have your bag.""

"The arrests came just days after the two, oil minister Eulogio del Pino and head of state oil company PDVSA, Nelson Martínez, were replaced in their posts with members of the military. A number of senior officials at Citgo, Venezuela's US-based refining company were detained last week. Critics of President Nicolás Maduro say this is part of a political purge. They say Mr Maduro, who is expected to stand for re-election in presidential elections due to be held next year, is sidelining influential and capable figures within his party who he thinks could become rivals for the presidency. Key industry Venezuela's oil industry is key for the government as it accounts for about 95% of the country's export earnings. But falling oil prices have seen earnings fall steeply and international credit ratings agencies declared PDVSA in default earlier this month. Critics of the Maduro government say the crisis in the country's oil industry is largely down to mismanagement and lack of investment. But the government has long maintained that it is the victim of an ""economic war"" waged against it by ""imperialist forces"". More recently, however, government officials have shifted the blame on to ""corrupt officials"". Chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab said in a news conference that Mr Del Pino was suspected of playing a part in a $500m (£370m) corruption scheme at Petrozamora, a joint venture between PDVSA and Gazprom. He also said that Mr Martínez had been detained for allegedly allowing a Citgo refinancing deal to proceed without the approval of the Venezuelan government.

The songwriter, who backed the charity project, said he hoped the model would be a ""huge hit"".

The pig sculpture was designed and painted by Norfolk artist Martin J Wall, and was commissioned by the county council as one of the official partners in the event.

It is hoped the auction of the 40 pigs at the end of the project will raise more than £100,000 and Ipswich's St Elizabeth Hospice, will benefit from money raised. Councillor Christopher Hudson, who lives in Sheeran's home town of Framlingham, said: ""Ed and his family are 100% behind this as he does a lot of fundraising work for local hospices.""

"Officers from Suffolk were among 6,000 from outside London drafted in to help police last week's disturbances. But the federation said plans to cut 100 officers and 200 civilian posts would make it harder to help in future. Matthew Hancock, Conservative MP for West Suffolk, said forces needed to cut red tape, bureaucracy and form-filling. ""It hampers them doing their jobs and that's where the chief constables have to find their efficiency savings, not at the front line,"" he said. Across England and Wales, 16,000 police officers are set to lose their jobs as forces make savings. 'Positive response' Mick Richardson, secretary of Suffolk Police Federation, said: ""We have been branded as inflexible and working Spanish practices and in need of gross reform. ""We say that's not the case and if they really think that 16,000 police officers can be replaced by not doing this form or that form then I'm afraid they are living with their head in a bucket of sand. ""Should we see such disorder in the future, we genuinely believe that we will be unable to mount such a positive response in such a timely manner."" The cuts to Suffolk Police are due to be made by 2015 as the force attempts to make savings of £13.5m. On Thursday Prime Minister David Cameron praised the efforts of officers from forces including Suffolk and Essex during the riots. ""The point I made about the deployment of officers is, I think, one of the lessons that we have to learn about the ability to surge up numbers when the circumstances require it,"" he said.",Suffolk Police Federation is warning that planned cuts to the force may hamper its ability to provide reinforcements at any future riots.
"Authorities say they are carrying out inquiries into other suspected cases. The news comes just over a week after Communist Party leaders agreed a list of ""cultural development guidelines"".

False stories The State Internet Information Office is quoted as saying that officials were still trying to trace the authors of a further three news stories that ""were not true"". The SIIO was created in May to supervise online content, including the regulation of news websites. The Chinese authorities have been concerned by a rise in the number of microbloggers - internet users who post short articles online to Twitter-like services. The country's most popular microblog operator, Sina Weibo, revealed that it had 250 million registered accounts sending about 90 million messages a day in August. The popularity of the medium gives Chinese citizens the opportunity to spread their opinions in a way that was not possible before. Earlier this month the SIIO's director general was reported to have told microbloggers that they would be punished if they spread lies, rumours or pornography. The warning came three months after the authorities blocked internet searches for retired President Jiang Zemin's name after online posts claimed he had died.

"By Glenn CampbellBBC political correspondent The party has yet to ask Transport Scotland officials for evidence in the case of a councillor who made controversial remarks about Transport Minister Humza Yousaf. Mr Yousaf said Labour's promise of swift action appeared to ""ring hollow"". Scottish Labour said investigations were continuing. It is understood the investigation is still at a ""preliminary"" stage. In March, Dumfries and Galloway councillor Jim Dempster was suspended by Labour following a complaint. He had apparently told transport officials that ""no-one would have seen (Mr Yousaf) under his burka"" when he visited the area. The councillor apologised and said he was ""ashamed and embarrassed"". But Mr Yousaf said he should be expelled by Labour. The party leader, Richard Leonard, ordered an investigation. But almost three months later, Transport Scotland said there had been ""no contact at all"" from Labour. In an interview with BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Humza Yousaf said: ""I was told there would be a swift investigation - I've not heard anything. ""I was heartened a few weeks after the complaint that I made, when Richard Leonard said there would be a zero tolerance approach and he'd be personally accountable for that. ""Almost three months later, for nothing to have happened, his words really ring hollow"". Diversity training It is understood the case is to be considered by Labour's ruling body - the NEC - next month. The party said it would inappropriate to comment. It's not the only racism case under investigation. In January, the Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said the party's council group leader in South Lanarkshire had told him ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown, Muslim, Paki"". The councillor - Davie McLachlan - categorically denied making the remarks but was suspended by the party. It's understood this case has been referred to UK Labour's national constitutional committee for a hearing later this year. In February, the MP Hugh Gaffney apologised for making what he said were ""deeply offensive and unacceptable"" remarks about Chinese and LGBT people. He was reprimanded by the party and sent for diversity training. In March, when Councillor Dempster's case was made public it led to further allegations against him. A Sanquhar man of Pakistani origin told the BBC that he had been repeatedly racially abused by Jim Dempster before he was elected. Councillor Dempster has strongly denied that allegation. Around this time, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard told an anti-racism rally that ""we need to be impatient and angry in our pursuit of justice and equality"". Letter of complaint A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: ""Investigations into alleged misconduct are continuing and as a result it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."" In May, five members in the Glasgow south-west constituency said they felt ""not wanted and not welcome"" in the Labour party because of their Asian background. They made the complaint in a letter to the party leadership and it's understood they have been invited to discuss their concerns with Mr Leonard after Ramadan. Scottish Labour adopted a plan to tackle racism at its Dundee conference in the spring and Mr Sarwar has established a cross-party group at Holyrood to tackle Islamophobia.","Scottish Labour has not contacted key witnesses in a racism investigation it began three months ago, the BBC has learned."
"A forensic psychiatrist who met with Gabrielle Friel told police the accused felt jealous and rejected and felt an affinity with Californian spree killer Elliott Rodger. Mr Friel, 22, denies charges of intending to commit acts of terrorism. He also denies expressing a ""desire to carry out a spree killing mass murder"". In a statement to the court, Dr Alexander Quinn's said: ""I asked him if he shared some of the ideals of Rodger, in particular his attitude to hating women for not being interested in him sexually. He agreed at times he did."" The High Court in Edinburgh heard the psychiatrist met Mr Friel in August last year. The accused was referred after being arrested by police in 2017 following an incident at Edinburgh College when he was armed with a knife. Mr Friel said he had thought about committing ""suicide by cop"" and became an inpatient at the Orchard Clinic secure unit at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. He was released back into the community in June 2018. Defence solicitor advocate Brian Gilfedder asked the psychiatrist if he was concerned that there might be a repeat of the college incident, whereby threatening to cause harm or actually causing harm to the public, Mr Friel would be shot by the authorities? Dr Quinn responded: ""That was my concern."" The psychiatrist said that during an interview with Mr Friel, things came up that he considered a risk - in particular when the accused talked about previous crimes by other people and the purchase of equipment. Mr Friel told him he had bought body armour and had been shopping for a crossbow. Forensic scientist Khaldoun Kabbani said that a crossbow recovered by police during the investigation was capable of killing someone. The weapon was found along with 20 inch arrows with pointed steel tips and a telescopic sight. A machete kukri knife with a 12 inch (30cm) blade and a protective vest were also recovered. Charges Mr Friel is alleged to have committed two offences under terrorism legislation between 1 June and 16 August last year at the Grindlay Court Community Justice Social Centre, the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and at his home in Comely Bank Road and elsewhere in Edinburgh. He is also accused of possessing the crossbow, scope, 15 arrows, a machete and ballistic vest in circumstances giving suspicion that his possession was for a purpose connected with ""the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism"". It is also alleged he researched online in an attempt to acquire a firearm and looked up spree killing mass murders and in particular mass murders committed by individuals expressing motivation from or affiliation with 'incels' (involuntary celibates)"". He is said to have ""expressed affinity with and sympathy for one incel-motivated mass murderer"" and he appeared to ""almost idolise"" US killer Elliot Rodger. He is also accused of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner between 12 July and 16 August 2019 by buying the weapons and equipment and storing them at the address in Comely Bank Road. Mr Friel is also accused of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 14 and 16 August last year at the social work centre and at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital by expressing an intention to commit a terrorist attack.

"Lawyers for David Turner had argued the doll was not covered by a law banning the importation of obscene items. But a judge dismissed that, saying ""any right-thinking person"" would find the doll obscene. Turner, 72, of Ramsgate, Kent, had already admitted possessing more than 34,000 indecent images of children. He will be sentenced in September. Other men have been convicted for importing child sex dolls, but this was the first case where the question of whether a doll is indecent or obscene had been tested by the courts. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was ""the first ruling of its kind"". Under the 1979 Customs and Excise Management Act it is against the law to import obscene or indecent items. NCA officers arrested Turner - an ex-church warden - in November last year after Border Force officers intercepted a 3ft doll that he was attempting to import from China. He claimed that it was intended to be a ""companion"" for him and his wife. Investigators said Turner already had two other child dolls at his home, one of which they claimed he had ""sex"" with. The charge was brought over a 3ft 10in sex doll already in his possession, which he bought clothes for. 'Unusual offence' In an earlier hearing, Turner also admitted possessing more than 34,000 indecent images of children, aged from three to 16, contained on 17 pen drives. Of the images, 138 were of the most serious kind, Category A. When interviewed, he also admitted ""secretly"" taking photographs of girls aged six to 11 in public places. Judge Simon James said the importation of a child sex doll was an ""unusual offence"" and that it ""adds a degree of complexity"" to the sentencing. Turner was freed on bail and will be sentenced on 8 September. The maximum sentence is seven years. The 'new phenomenon' of child sex dolls By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent More than 100 child sex dolls have been seized in the UK as part of a special operation set up by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Border Force. Investigators believe the dolls, which are made to be as life-like as possible, are being imported by people who have a ""sexual interest"" in children. Advertised as ""adult dolls"" on sites including EBay and Amazon, they are manufactured in the Far East and sent to Britain via courier, fast parcel and other delivery services. Hazel Stewart, operations manager for the NCA, said when people have been questioned by police about the dolls some have claimed they were bought for a ""joke"", others say they for ""companionship"". ""If it was a Marks and Spencer mannequin I wouldn't be stood here,"" she said. Read more from Danny Shaw. Call for action Hazel Stewart, from the National Crime Agency, said: ""We know [child sex doll] purchases can indicate other offences against children, as was the case against Turner who had a sickening stash of abuse images. ""Importers of such obscene items should expect to have law enforcement closing in on them."" Jon Brown, head of development for the NSPCC, welcomed the ruling, but wants more to be done to tackle the issue of child sex dolls. ""The NSPCC is calling on government to take action to criminalise the manufacturing, distribution and possession of these grotesque dolls, in the same way it does indecent images of children,"" he said. The NSPCC has previously called for sites selling the dolls to take them down, telling BBC Radio 5 live that it could lead into ""contact offending"" and ""normalises"" it.",A judge has ruled that a child sex doll imported by a former primary school governor is an obscene item.
"The event is part of an unprecedented international inquiry into disinformation and fake news. Richard Allan, Facebook's vice-president of policy solutions, appeared in Mr Zuckerberg's place. He said he took responsibility for deciding who appeared at which committee. The session was attended by parliamentarians from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Latvia, and Singapore as well as members of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Its chairman Damian Collins, has repeatedly asked Mr Zuckerberg to attend hearings. Lord Allan, who is also a Liberal Democrat peer, faced a grilling on various Facebook policies and actions in addition to the subject of why his boss wasn't there. ""We've never seen anything quite like Facebook, where, while we were playing on our phones and apps, our democratic institutions... seem to have been upended by frat-boy billionaires from California,"" remarked Canadian politician Charlie Angus. It had been thought that a cache of Facebook documents, seized by MPs from a US businessman on the grounds that they were relevant to the inquiry, might be shared - but Mr Collins said that they would not be published today. He later said that they will be published - possibly in the next week. Lord Allan said he believed it would be unfair to take ""internal conversations"" and ""robust comments"" as the company's official position. The Observer, which first reported the story about the documents being seized, said they included data about Facebook's privacy controls. They had been sealed by a US court, and Facebook has demanded their return. However, the contents of one email from 2014 were alluded to, in which a Facebook engineer reported unusual levels of Russian activity - namely that huge amounts of data were being pulled daily from devices with Russian IP addresses. Lord Allan was asked whether any action was taken, or authorities notified. He said the information he had was ""partial at best"" and that he would have to come back with more details. Facebook has since responded that its engineers had looked into the matter at the time and ""found no evidence of specific Russian activity"". The BBC understands that the data calls turned out to be legitimately coming from the social media platform Pinterest, and that there were not billions of them as suggested in the hearing. App bans Lord Allan was unable to name a single occasion when Facebook had banned an app for breaking its rules, despite saying that it was Facebook's policy to do so. In a later session, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the hearing that Facebook informed her it had banned 200 apps during the summer of 2018. ""I'm not aware of any case before the revelation [of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal]"", she said. Lord Allan also acknowledged that Facebook had ""damaged public trust"" through some of its actions and said the firm was in favour of a ""regulatory framework"" for the social media giant.",Politicians from nine countries reacted angrily to the absence of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing today.
"By Prof Donal O'DonoghueFormer National Clinical Director for Kidney Care The recent ""horrific"" case of 100-year-old Lydia Spilner who died of dehydration in a Leicester hospital led Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to call for a 'radical overhaul' of the NHS's patient safety approach. This followed the government's newly appointed patient safety tsar, Prof Don Berwick, diagnosing an ""enormous sickness"" within the NHS, caused by a deteriorating culture of safety in the wake of the disturbing events at Mid Staffs. Prof's Berwick patient safety group is expected to report in July on how the culture of the NHS and the care it provides can improve, and where not ""a single injury"" is tolerated. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one such ""injury"" - yet it it has a low profile, is poorly understood and also seriously under-prioritised within patient safety debates. What may have gone unnoticed in Lydia Spilner's tragic case was that her ultimate cause of death was AKI. AKI is the sudden loss of kidney function, which can easily develop in any sick person through infection such as pneumonia, diarrhoea or a heart attack. Dehydration, and some commonly used medicines prime the kidney for an acute shut down. 'Conservative' estimate For Lydia Spilner, just as for around one third of cases, AKI could have been prevented through the provision of basic clinical care. That's as simple as making sure that patients are hydrated, medication is reviewed, and infections are treated promptly and reliably. What is more, conservative estimates indicate that providing this care could prevent up to 12,000 deaths each year. To help put these statistics in perspective, the numbers of preventable deaths from AKI is exactly 10 times the number of people that died in Mid Staffs, and works out at 32 people each day in the NHS. AKI is clearly one of the major patient safety issues for the NHS. It affects the vulnerable and leads to thousands of unnecessary deaths because of failings in care. In spite of this, a report in 2009 from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death found that only half of patients with AKI had received 'good' care, with delays in diagnosis due to only a third receiving inadequate investigations. A fifth of fatal cases were caused by drug prescribing errors. 'Zero harm' aim Notwithstanding the need of addressing the human tragedy caused by AKI, there is clearly a practical reason for the government to focus on AKI. It is about ensuring that some of the most vulnerable patients in the NHS are treated with dignity and respect. We can therefore see AKI as the single measure which will tell us if we are making progress from the nadir of Mid Staffs. Put simply, if we can get it right for AKI, we will get basic care right across the NHS. To truly achieve a ""zero harm"" NHS, then the plans to tackle AKI and delivering good kidney care must be at the heart of the NHS patient safety approach. Ensuring that healthcare professionals think of the kidney as a marker of good quality care and consider the risks of AKI as a matter of course, will drive exactly the care needed to make certain that patients are treated with dignity and respect. Improving AKI treatment will therefore not only prevent many unnecessary and tragic deaths, but it will be the key to unlocking the culture shift that Hunt and Berwick are calling for and the NHS so clearly needs.","The quality of patient care in the NHS is once again under the spotlight as part of the investigation into complaints after deaths at Furness General Hospital. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Donal O'Donoghue, National Clinical Director for Kidney Care from 2007-2013, warns a simple-to-avoid kidney disorder is being missed leading to around 12,000 unnecessary deaths a year."
"Iain McSporran QC made the claim as he urged jury members to convict Edward Cairney, 77, and Avril Jones, 59. The advocate depute added ""greed, arrogance and lies"" had led to a murder charge. Mr Cairney and Ms Jones deny killing Ms Fleming at their house in Inverkip, Inverclyde, between 18 December 1999 and 5 January 2000. The couple had been Ms Fleming's carers since her father died in October 1995. She has allegedly not been seen for more than 19 years. On Tuesday, Mr Cairney told the court he was ""incapable of harming a kid or a lady"" as he denied the murder charge. The trial also heard claims of where Ms Fleming may be. Mr Cairney said she had gone with travellers, but would return when she needed money. However, Mr McSporran questioned why Ms Fleming had not been in touch in light of the trial to clarify matters. He also said: ""Margaret and her body hasn't been found and probably wouldn't be found. ""No one in the authorities noticed Margaret's absence. She disappeared and no one noticed or cared."" 'Fabricated' letters The prosecutor also mentioned error-strewn letters apparently sent to the couple by Ms Fleming from London. Jurors have heard how she had foundation-level literacy. Mr McSporran said: ""The Crown say they were involved in a cover-up and then writing letters. ""If you were going to fabricate a letter would you put it out beautifully or would you do it how someone with these difficulties would do it? ""You would put in spelling errors, no punctuation and you would want people to think this was the person she was like - backwards and slow."" Mr Cairney's co-accused Ms Jones also denies defrauding Ms Fleming of £182,000 in benefits between 18 December 1999 and 26 October 2017. Last week, prosecutors withdrew a number of charges against the couple, including that Mr Cairney defrauded Ms Fleming of the benefits. Charges dropped against both accused included abducting and assaulting Ms Fleming by locking her in a room, cutting her hair and binding her arms and wrists with tape on various occasions between 1 November 1997 and 5 January 2000. A charge that the couple attempted to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of Ms Fleming's personal effects and pretending she was alive was also dropped. 'Getting away with it' A major police investigation was sparked on 28 October 2016 after a benefits claim submitted by Ms Jones on Ms Fleming's behalf raised concerns about her wellbeing. Mr McSporran said: ""If Avril Jones wasn't a liar, hadn't exaggerated what Margaret was suffering from and if the government didn't ask to apply this new benefit, no one would have discovered. ""Sheer greed and arrogance and getting away with it for years."" He added: ""Criminals who are masterminds don't get caught, but those who make mistakes do. ""They covered up the truth and they caused it - Edward Cairney murdered Margaret Fleming and did try to defeat the ends of justice and was assisted by his partner and partner in crime, fraudster Avril Jones."" The trial continues.","A couple accused of murdering Margaret Fleming were involved in a ""cover-up"", a prosecutor has said."
"Luke Durbin was 19 when he was last seen after a night out in Ipswich in 2006. The play, called The Missing, had its premiere in London in November and the company behind it is seeking funding to take it on tour. Nicki Durbin said performing it in the Suffolk town may help the inquiry. Mr Durbin was reported missing on 13 May 2006 after he failed to return to his home in Hollesley near Woodbridge. Suffolk Police is treating the case as a murder inquiry, but no body has been found and no charges have been brought. 'Emotionally overwhelming' Ms Durbin went to see the play when it was staged for three nights at the 40-seat Etcetera Theatre, above a pub in Camden, north London. She said it was ""powerful and emotionally overwhelming"". ""I want to keep the profile of Luke's disappearance high and I'd welcome the play being staged in Suffolk,"" she said. ""We believe someone locally knows what happened to Luke and I would hope this play finally prompts them to go to the police."" George Evans, from the LotToDo theatre company, played Luke Durbin in The Missing. ""We are in the process of trying to get funding to take it on tour,"" he said. ""To perform it in Ipswich would be fantastic as I think it would raise the profile of the issue of missing people in a place that has been directly affected by it. ""Our aim was to raise general awareness through focusing on missing teenage boys or young men whose cases don't usually get a lot of national attention."" Ms Durbin said watching Mr Evans ""was like reliving the last time I saw my son"". ""George, who had never met or studied video recordings of him, astoundingly managed to capture an essence of Luke,"" she said. ""I was slightly anxious as to how they could construct the play, but my anxieties were not necessary."" Two men, who were arrested in connection with the murder inquiry earlier this year, have been released on police bail .","A play about a missing man thought to have been murdered should be put on in his home town and may help the police inquiry, his mother has said."
"The latest official tourism figures were up 0.6% on 2010. Senator Alan Maclean, the economic development minister, said it was very encouraging news at a time when fewer people were going on holiday. The figures showed people on holiday and business trips to Jersey spent £242m in the island last year, making the States more than £12m pounds in goods and services tax. The minister said this proved how valuable the hospitality sector was to Jersey's economy. He said it also reflected a trend towards higher-graded accommodation. 'Maximum return' Senator Maclean said niche markets including walking holidays and people visiting from Europe had been particularly important. The figures showed the biggest rise was from mainland Europe, with nearly a quarter more Germans and 10% more French visitors. About 98,000 people went to Jersey on business in 2011, also slightly up on the previous year. Senator Maclean said: ""I think we need to be cleverer in the way we spend our money, we need to get maximum return for every pound invested. ""I think we have to look at online marketing, which has been quite successful, social media, and PR. ""All these areas can target specialist and niche groups which has helped without doubt, to see these figures that we are able to unveil today.""",There was a small rise in the number of visitors to Jersey last year.
"By Sophie MaddenBBC News When eight-year-old Shadow was attacked by two dogs in the summer, she suffered a nasty bite to her stomach. Her owner, Jonathan Wall, said within two days it got infected and developed an abscess. Being homeless at the time, he said he didn't have the means to get her the treatment she needed. He said: ""The situation I was in, I couldn't make contact with vets, covering the costs was difficult. ""Street Vet provided everything - the antibiotics and emergency surgery if it was needed."" The nationwide scheme, run by volunteers, offers free veterinary care to homeless people and their animals. ""Their focus is on the wellbeing of the animal, if they see a need they will step in,"" said Jonathan, who lives in Birmingham. ""Without them, I wouldn't like to think what the outcome for Shadow would have been."" Jonathan and Shadow have been together for five years. The 37-year-old has recently found work with the help of another charity in the city, and his new boss helped find him a place to live. But on the street, it was his pet who helped him connect with others. ""Shadow and I are a partnership, a team,"" he added. ""She helps warm people who wouldn't normally speak to me, they will open up [with] her [around]."" At Digbeth charity HomeLESS One, Rocky the German Shepherd is sitting patiently, having his eye examined. Vet Sarah Chapman has just finished cleaning his ears, checking his teeth and listening to his heart. Rocky is one of her first patients, on her first night volunteering with Street Vet. The charity visits the site for a couple of hours every Sunday night, taking with them a bag containing the basics - thermometers, antibiotics, nail clippers, microchips, flea and worming treatments. Sarah, a freelance vet based in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: ""I think it is something all vets want to be able to do. ""The cost of veterinary medicine is so expensive, and it allows us to provide assistance to these animals which are so important to their owners."" Street Vet operates in cities across the UK, but the Birmingham branch launched in June, so this will be its first winter helping animals in the city. As well as visiting HomeLESS One, a group of volunteers will also walk around the centre on Sunday nights, looking for homeless people with animals who may need their help. They also visit hostels and are starting up a weekly clinic. Neil Smith, lead vet at the Birmingham branch, said they now have about 45 qualified vets or registered veterinary nurses who volunteer outside their normal jobs. ""The [owners] look after their dogs and cats really well and it is really a question of giving them access to veterinary services,"" he said. ""The problems tend to be quite minor - a little limp, an infected ear, another needs eye drops - but they are well looked after. ""The animals tend to sleep in the same bedding as their owners which keeps them quite warm, but at the moment we are also giving out dog coats."" Birmingham Street Vets has 40 to 45 animals on its books, but their owners tend to move around which means they aren't always seen regularly. If they need care the vets can't provide during their outreach work, they have partnerships with practices and laboratories that can do the necessary treatments and tests for free. You might also be interested in: Back at HomeLESS One, Rocky, who is six months old, was microchipped by the vets last time they saw him, and is wearing the coat, collar and lead he was given. Sarah discusses with his owner the possibility of arranging to have him neutered in the new year. She also gives advice about an eye problem Rocky has had since birth. Also working on the night is Sue Wildman, a registered veterinary nurse who has been with Street Vet since it started. She has brought some special food for Rocky and is handing out wrapped Christmas boxes for dogs, filled with toys, treats and food collected through donations. ""I love it,"" she said. ""You get to know the people and their animals. It is lovely, you look out for people."" Sue keeps records of all the animals that have been seen at HomeLESS One, so if they return the papers can be updated with their latest treatment. For Rocky, his check-up is done and he is free to go. His owner says the service the vets provide is ""great"". Sue added: ""We like to come every night, even if there aren't any animals, people will know we are still here to help."" Javid Iqbal, from Birmingham charity Homeless Heroes, said providing treatment for the animals was something that was really appreciated by the owners. ""Often it is the only friend that people have, living on the streets. ""If Street Vet wasn't there they wouldn't be able to do anything, they would just have to let the animals suffer - die in some cases. ""Their animals are often the one they have to rely on, to be there for them, something to cuddle up to at night.""

"The 6% rise came despite the waning popularity of ebooks, which saw sales fall by 3% to £538m last year. Sales of children's books rose 16% to £365m, with the increase due mainly to the purchase of printed works. Readers also flocked to fitness and self-help books, sending non-fiction sales up 9%. Revenues from fiction fell 7%, the PA's annual report said. Including journals, the PA said that the publishing industry - covering books and journals - saw a 7% increase in sales to £4.8bn. Exports rose 6% to £2.6bn, benefiting from a decline in the value of sterling, but also rising in line with domestic growth. Exports of children's books increased 34% to £116m. The export gains reversed three previous years of declines. 'Eye-catching' In 2015, adult colouring books and the 150th anniversary of Alice in Wonderland helped the swell in physical book sales, while ebook sales fell 1.6%. This time, books on the Danish concept of hygge, which is usually translated into English as ""cosiness"", assisted factual sales, as well as fitness books by personal trainer Joe Wicks. While ebook sales took a hit, digital distribution helped other media. Journals made a 10% gain last year to £1.2bn, led by a jump in electronic subscriptions. ""Last year, one of the most eye-catching figures from our statistics was that physical book sales were increasing while digital book sales dropped,"" said chief executive Stephen Lotinga. ""While many will debate as to whether this trend will continue, we should not ignore the fact that digital sales beyond the domestic ebook market are growing.""","Children's fiction helped drive UK book sales to a record £3.5bn last year, the Publishers Association (PA) has said."
"By Christina McSorleyBBC News NI Det Ch Insp David Henderson said casual drug use in Northern Ireland facilitates crime gangs. ""Anybody who is buying drugs at the weekend is contributing to the violence and intimidation that is happening in our communities,"" he said. He was speaking at the launch of an anti drugs campaign in Dublin. It will be rolled out in NI later this month. ""I didn't want an area that had an easier policing job."" Created by Safer Blanchardstown, and launched by the Gardaí (Irish Police) on Wednesday, the campaign links casual drug use with drug-related crime. The initiative originated from a Dublin community group, but caught the attention of a PSNI inspector when he was on secondment in the area. Det Chief Insp Henderson said the PSNI is dealing with the evolving nature of the drug gangs that do not recognise geographical borders. ""There are groups of drug gangs that work cross border - they work out of Dublin and supply drugs into Northern Ireland. ""We realised we cannot arrest our way out of the drug-gang problem."" He said he hopes the Think Before You Buy initiative will change attitudes in Northern Ireland. PSNI Insp Jonny Francey discovered the scheme when he was on an exchange programme to the gardai in Blanchardstown last year. ""I wanted to go somewhere that was going to be a difficult area to police; somewhere where drugs are a problem so I could get experience, and bring that back with me,"" he said. ""Blanchardstown is a very mixed area; there are some extremely affluent areas in it, however, I did get to see areas such as Ballymun and Mulhuddart where there is quite a bit of social decay and problems related to drugs and drugs supply,"" he said. Garda Insp Tony Twomey believes that the exchange schemes show that the two police forces have more in common than what differentiates them. ""You may think that because of the history of policing in Northern Ireland that things would be very different but the bread and butter issues on the ground are the same. ""We were well able to interlink and exchange ideas,"" he said. It was at a community meeting where Inspector Francey came across the Safer Blanchardstown and local drugs taskforce teams which had carried out research into drug debt intimidation. It is their campaign that will be rolled out by the PSNI in Northern Ireland. ""We are copying their project and bringing it north of the border,"" Insp Francey said. Philip Jennings is an addiction councillor and the co-ordinator of Safer Blanchardstown. He says the silence around drug abuse is feeding into stigma and fear. ""Last week, one man asked what he could do about his son. ""He just discovered that his son was spending all his earnings on weed, nothing else. ""The father didn't see it coming. ""It is very difficult to get people to speak openly."" Mr Jennings hopes the Think Before You Buy video will ""start the conversation"". However, before it comes north the PSNI will be making one minor adjustment; it will get a fresh local accent. PSNI Const Tom Phillips has just finished recording his voiceover for the piece. He was selected to take part in the video because while working on his day-to-day duties in his station he would deliver announcements over the internal speaker system with his own ""unique flare"". He said that ""education is massively important"" in making people realise the harm that is caused by recreational drug use.","About 90% of the income from illicit drugs comes from recreational use, the Police Service of NI has said."
"The idea has come from HAHAV (Hospice at Home Aberystwyth Volunteering) whose volunteers support GPs, nurses and other professionals providing palliative care in Ceredigion. The charity aims to take over the Plas Antaron Hotel to offer therapies for patients and respite for carers. Ceredigion County Council will consider the application in the coming months. HAHAV currently involves about 80 volunteers supporting between 20 and 30 families at any one time. Chairman Dr Alan Axford said: ""So far we have only been able to support people in a home setting - sitting with them, doing shopping or taking them out on trips. ""This would offer more of a respite opportunity for carers, and also bring people back into the community. ""It would change our work quite remarkably."" The charity has agreed to lease the building from its owners, who are retiring from the hotel business, with the aim of raising £600,000 to buy the property within three years.",An Aberystwyth hotel could be turned into a day hospice providing services for people with life-limiting illness.
"By Andy VerityBBC economics correspondent He made the admission to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday. They were taking evidence on a leaked regulator's report that found an ""intentional, co-ordinated strategy"" to put RBS's interests ahead of customers. Mr McEwan said RBS ""successfully turns round the vast majority of businesses that it works with"". He added: ""The bank, through its restructuring team, helped minimise those losses where it could, successfully turning round thousands of businesses, safeguarding hundreds of thousands of jobs."" However, Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan forced an admission from Mr McEwan that his statement was wrong in the light of an official report leaked to the BBC. ""You made a statement in 2014 about GRG turning around the vast majority of businesses that it works with and I'm asking you - that statement was not true?"" she asked. ""In 2014, absolutely when you look at the stats that have come through - that is not right,"" Mr McEwan said. The 2014 statement drew from findings by solicitors Clifford Chance, appointed by RBS to conduct what it claimed was an ""independent inquiry"" into allegations of mistreatment of business customers. Mr McEwan claimed at the time: ""Our first priority then and now is to try and help our customers recover."" That statement was contradicted by the central finding of an inquiry commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which concluded in 2016 and was leaked to the BBC last August. The inquiry, conducted by consultants Promontory and Mazars, found the bank had twin objectives: its own commercial interests on the one hand, and helping business customers turn their fortunes around on the other. It concluded there there were conflicts of interest between those objectives. The leaked report also found that only 10% of business customers put into the Global Restructuring Group were subsequently returned to normal banking. It also found 86% were subject to some form of inappropriate treatment - which in important respects should be viewed as ""systematic"". More small businesses get access to Financial Ombudsman Santander boss named in RBS scandal Following the hearing, the FCA said it was happy to release the report into GRG in full after Mr McEwan indicated that the bank would not object. However, it said publication would require the consent of those who provided the information as well as any individuals identified. ""We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish,"" the FCA said. 'Considerable distress' Tony Boorman, managing director of Promontory consultants who authored the FCA report, told MPs that the effect of their actions on small business customers was not ""uppermost in the minds"" of GRG staff. ""We were very conscious in speaking to many of the customers in our sample of the very considerable distress that was caused by some of the events that we witnessed,"" he said. Mr McEwan repeated apologies first made in 2016 that RBS ""didn't get everything right"", but refused to accept that staff had been ""insensitive and aggressive"". That drew an angry response from Alister Jack MP, who cited his own experience as a business owner in conflict with the bankers from the GRG division in 2009. ""The manager who came to see me with his assistant … was not only aggressive, he was thuggish. He shouted at his assistant because she couldn't make her numbers stand up, reduced her to tears, and as he left my office and headed down the stairs, he was still shouting at her. ""So don't tell anyone that you don't for a minute think that your staff were not aggressive, please. It's just offensive.""",RBS boss Ross McEwan has admitted a statement he made claiming that bank's Global Restructuring Group helped most of its business customers was wrong.

Mr Mueller had originally tried to sue the pop star, saying that her claims had cost him his job. But that lawsuit was thrown out by a judge last week. On Monday, the jury also rejected similar claims Mueller had made against the singer's mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell. In a statement following the verdict, Ms Swift said: ""I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. ""My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves."" The assault took place during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour. Mr Mueller, then a host on the radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show. The singer complained to KYGO and the station fired Mr Mueller two days later.

"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News You browse online, click on something you fancy, and lo and behold often as little as 24 hours later it's on your front door step. This seemingly magical process - a relatively recent phenomenon - is being made possible by one of the oldest industries on the planet - shipping. Most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how what we buy gets to us. Yet most of the clothes you wear, much of the food you eat, the TV you watch, your phone and even the materials for the house you live in will have come to you via a ship. ""You can put anything in a box more or less,"" quips James Leeson, head of port commercial, at DP World London Gateway. The boxes here mostly contain frozen foods such as chicken and beef, and fruit such as bananas. Occasionally they may contain the lifelong belongings of a family moving overseas, expensive cars, or even, as was the case recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson's yacht. The port officially opened for business just four years ago. The windswept, vast space has literally redrawn the Essex landscape. Situated 20 miles down the River Thames from London, in Thurrock, Essex, the port sits on a bed of sand and silt dredged from the Thames on the site of a former oil refinery. The £1.5bn construction saw a staggering 350,000 animals moved off site into new habitats. At one stage DP World's office building on the site homed tanks of great crested newts before they were moved into newly created ponds. It was planned long before the financial crisis when the world economy was booming and ports were struggling to handle the sheer volumes of goods coming in. The two busiest container ports in the south east are Hutchison Whampoa's Felixstowe, in Suffolk, and DP World's other port in Southampton. And so far the number of containers London Gateway has handled in its short existence has been dwarfed by its rivals. Last year, Felixstowe handled almost six times as many containers as London Gateway. Mr Leeson is undeterred - saying the company is in it for the long term. ""It takes a bit of time to get moving. Shipping volumes are up and we've got big names signing up to leases in logistics park,"" he says. The port's deep channels means it can handle the latest biggest ships, the so called Neo-Panamaxes. These giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, are increasingly the way goods are shipped. Its other big advantage is that most of the port's operations are automated. In a space which is twice the size of the City of London just 500 people are employed. 'Frictionless trade' This means faster ""frictionless trade"", says Mr Leeson. It is this that London Gateway believes will help it to gain more customers. Incoming trucks have to pre-register and are scanned on arrival, before being sent to a specific bay where an automated crane removes or adds their container, meaning they can be in and out in half an hour. The containers themselves are organised by huge cranes which stalk the landscape like Star Wars At-Ats. Like an oversized game of Jenga, where each container goes is carefully organised to make sure that the boxes which need to unloaded or loaded first are near the top. A sophisticated computer system continually tracks where the containers are in the port. Mr Leeson says this is crucial. ""It used to be that your box would arrive at port and you'd have no clue what happened. Now you can track it through port and see when it's ready for collection. Consumers are more and more demanding and we had to respond to that,"" he says. But it is the scale of its logistics park which DP World is betting on to be London Gateway's biggest lure. Currently most of the goods imported into the UK are taken by road, and some by rail, to big distribution centres in the Midlands, the traditional logistics hub for the country. This means shipped goods are often driven from the south, up north to be packaged or priced, and then driven back to the south where the majority of items are bought and sold. DP World believes the space it is offering will enable firms to process goods immediately after arrival, speeding up their deliveries to shops and to consumers increasingly used to Amazon Prime's 24-hour delivery promise. Environmentally it will cut carbon emissions, but crucially DP World also expects it to cut costs. So far, parcel giant UPS and discount supermarket Lidl have taken space, with Dixons Carphone also reported to soon be opening up a warehouse. And fruit importer SH Pratt Group is getting ready to build a giant refrigerated facility for its new venture Halo, which will package chilled and frozen goods. Currently, the space is a muddy patch of wasteland, but Halo's managing director Gavin Knight says it will be up and running by next summer. He says the decision to choose London Gateway was ""quite simple"". ""As soon as you put a container on wheels it adds cost. [This way] we're saving time, food miles and money,"" he says. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But Neil Davidson, shipping consultancy Drewry's senior analyst for ports and terminals, says firms will have to weigh up the advantages against the potentially higher cost of renting space and hiring staff in the south east. With the shipping market growing ""steadily but not hugely"", the only way for London Gateway to succeed will be to steal market share from its local rivals, Mr Davidson says. It's something that London Gateway has already started to do, albeit on a small scale. But Mr Leeson is confident its growth will continue, ""We built London Gateway as a future proof model for future trade,"" he says. And its other big advantage as Brexit looms is that 99% of its trade comes from outside the EU. ""We are confident that whatever happens we will see an upturn in trade,"" he says.","Just five years ago, DP World London Gateway was still being dredged from the Thames. Now the UK's newest port is trying to lure the world's biggest ships to its quayside to get us our shopping quicker."
"Mr Mawarire was taken from his home and charged with inciting violence. Offices and businesses remained closed on Wednesday and the streets of the capital, Harare, were largely deserted. Several people have been killed and hundreds arrested in the protests. Mobile networks, acting on government orders, have suspended internet access. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare says many Zimbabweans are questioning what happens next, especially as they can no longer access popular messaging platforms such as Whatsapp - a major source of information. Earlier on Wednesday, police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered at the only supermarket currently operating in Harare's business district. However, there have not any fresh reports of protesters manning barricades on Wednesday - as seen earlier this week. Pastor Mawarire was arrested by armed police at his house on Wednesday morning. The pastor gained fame as a figurehead of the #ThisFlag protests against the former president, Robert Mugabe, in 2016. He was cleared in 2017 on charges of attempting a violent overthrow of the government. The latest street protests have coincided with a three-day strike called by unions angered by a more-than-twofold increase in the price of fuel. President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the price hike was aimed at tackling shortages caused by an increase in fuel use and ""rampant"" illegal trading. Popular anger over the decision has been spurred by discontent over runaway inflation and a decline in living standards. The protesters have accused the president - currently on a tour of Russia and Asian countries - of failing to live up to his promises. Mr Mnangagwa came to power in November 2017 after Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations.

The hike means petrol prices rose from $1.24 (£0.97) a litre to $3.31 , with diesel up from $1.36 a litre to $3.11.

"The line was set to open in May and had been in use for test runs. About 300m of the embankment in Qianjiang city collapsed last Friday, Xinhua news agency says. News of the incident only emerged on Monday. China has embarked on an ambitious project to expand its high-speed rail network across the country. But this is just the latest incident to tarnish the reputation of the new network, says the BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing. The collapsed embankment is part of the Hanyi High Speed Railway, which links the provincial capital Wuhan with Yichang to the west. Hundreds of workers have been sent to the site to repair the damage.Photos from a local newspapershow workers removing rails and sleepers from the scene. Heavy rain apparently caused the foundations to give way on the railway line, which forms part of the trunk route of the national high-speed network. But one report from the local official news portal says the owner of the railway has rebuked initial local reports, saying they are ""untrue"". ""It is part of the process to rectify quality problems spotted on the embankment in pre-launch tests,"" the railway company claims. Some internet users in China, however, are not convinced by the explanation. They ask if there are any flaws in the construction process. On microblogging site Sina Weibo, a user from Yichang said: ""Thank goodness that it collapsed early enough, or it would be yet another tragedy if it happened after launch."" Another user, from Wuhan, said: ""I was longing for a more convenient journey home, now I'd better have no expectations.""

"By David SilverbergBusiness reporter Pennsylvania bank boss John Spier was fed up with looking like a ""stuffy banker"". So after decades of wearing loose-fitting pinstripe suits and anonymous ties, he decided he wanted a fashion makeover. Taking a leap of faith, Mr Spier enlisted the help of a corporate stylist Toi Sweeney. Overnight his old wardrobe was binned, to be replaced with ""warmer ties and a more fitted suit"", says Mr Spier. ""She was able to preserve the professional look I wanted without making me seem like a stuffy banker."" Mr Spier says he went from an executive who rarely thought about what he was going to wear, to someone who likes wearing colourful ties. More importantly, he says the makeover has put a spring in his step, and made him more confident. The saying, ""you never get a second chance to make a first impression"" perhaps resonates most in the workplace, where bosses must exude authority but also friendliness, and the rest of us want to look professional, but stand out. Ms Sweeney believes ""we are all products and your personal brand steps through the door before you do"". She may have a point. According to research from Princeton University, when we see a new face, our brains decide whether a person is attractive and trustworthy within a tenth of a second. Ms Sweeney says that the colours you wear also have a big impact on how others quickly perceive you. For example, she says red is a powerful colour that implies confidence and leadership qualities. Whereas, blue apparently connotes a warmer approach, since ""it's the colour of trust and being a peacemaker"". And black can suggest authority and sophistication, but Ms Sweeney advises that it should be mixed up with a splash of colour. She recommends a bright handkerchief in a suit pocket for men, or a colourful handbag for women, so as the person can stand out from the crowd. Meanwhile, the colour brown should also not be discounted since it often suggests that the wearer is reliable. ""Ever wonder why United Parcel Service workers only wear brown?"" says Ms Sweeney. Kara Kuryllowicz, a 57-year-old corporate writer based in Toronto, hired a stylist last year to help modernise her look. ""I thought everything I owned was fine, but she came to my place and went through my closet and threw out 80% of my clothes,"" she remembers. Ms Kuryllowicz says she had ""a long-time love affair with black and white, but now I'm wearing more colours"". ""Now I'm [also] wearing more jewellery with colour, and I feel really comfortable wearing it."" Her new colourful look makes her feel more ""professional and confident"" and has helped her to win more work, she says. While the cynical might question whether wearing a certain colour to work can really make a difference, a number of studies have actually shown that it can affect how we feel. In a report published earlier this year in the European Journal of Social Psychology, participants who wore red reported feeling more physically attractive and sexually receptive than those who wore blue. Also, in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, subjects who donned white coats that they thought belonged to doctors did better on tests than those who wore casual clothes, or those who thought the coats belonged to artists. ""What you're wearing affects your mood and builds your confidence. It's worth it to always dress a little better than those around you,"" says Toi Sweeney. Someone who knows about dressing better, is Kim Winser, a former chief executive of the UK fashion brands Aquascutum and Pringle of Scotland. She now runs Winser London, a luxury women's fashion label which also advises clients on what to wear in the office and for overseas meetings. Ms Winser says that using colour is important, but doesn't override the overall need to look as smart and presentable as possible.

The homeowners hiring out their houses as film sets ""Since executives are travelling more now than ever, they want to ensure they can make a great first impression in front of clients and colleagues when they don't have their full wardrobe with them,"" says Ms Winser. She also stresses the importance of polishing your shoes, especially before a job interview. ""I know many interviewers who say they first look at someone's shoes, if they're scruffy or clean,"" she says. Though once your shoes are in good shape, she cautions there shouldn't be a hard-and-fast rule when it comes to what to wear. Instead your fashion voice will be determined by your position and company. A start-up in California will have a different dress code than a law firm in Paris, for example.

"By Arturo WallaceBBC Mundo, Bogota There are a few broken windows and passers-by tend to stare at the site of the explosion, but otherwise it is business as usual at the corner of 74 Street and Caracas Avenue. Pedro Salamanca is there, selling mangoes and papayas, as he has for the past five years. He was doing the same when the bomb went off on 15 May. Two people were killed and dozens injured, including Fernando Londono, a former interior minister who, according to the authorities, was the intended target. ""I was here, working, when I heard the blast,"" Mr Salamanca, 65, told the BBC. ""We hadn't had bombs like these for several years,"" he said. For many Bogotanos, the attack brought back memories of the many bombings ordered by drug baron Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then the tactic has also been widely used by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), but the Colombian capital had not been hit as badly in a long time. And in this case it is proving much more difficult to determine who is to blame. The guerrillas were quickly accused of being responsible for Tuesday's attack by a police commander. But shortly afterwards President Juan Manuel Santos adopted a more cautious approach. ""We don't know who is behind this attack,"" said Mr Santos. ""But this government will not be thrown off course by the terrorists,"" he added. Mr Santos' caution is a good indicator of how much is at stake. His political rivals, especially those to his right, like former president Alvaro Uribe, are using the attack to lambaste his security policies. Mr Londono, a close ally Mr Uribe, is himself fiercely critical of Mr Santos' willingness to consider a negotiated solution to the long-running civil conflict. Back to routine If the Farc are indeed responsible, the Colombian president might have to kiss goodbye any possibility of dialogue. Such an outcome, however, would go against the rebels' declared intentions. It is difficult to establish whether the Farc really want peace, but they have certainly been pushing for peace talks. And for many analysts this means the extreme right groups opposed to the talks cannot be ruled out as potential perpetrators of the bombing. ""The aim is to bring the country to a state in which talking about a negotiated peace is simply no longer possible,"" said Ivan Cepeda, a deputy from the leftist Polo Democratico party. ""It's obvious there are forces that are against the possibility of peace,"" he told the BBC. In the meantime, as the investigation progresses, the Colombian government is not taking any chances. The streets of Bogota are filled with police searching vehicles and pedestrians. Among other security measures, an anti-terrorist committee for the Colombian capital has been set up. Another group will have the job of identifying security risks to specific politicians. The citizens of Bogota, however, are trying to get back to normal. ""I do feel unsafe, but we have to carry on, don't you think?"" 20-year-old student Jessica Rincon told the BBC. ""You cannot let this sort of thing intimidate you, especially if you're a student and want to help to build a better, different country"".",Only a couple of days have passed but the scene of the first deadly bombing in Bogota in three years already looks pretty much like any other busy spot in the Colombian capital.
"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales The exchanges followed a familiar pattern. Labour MPs are still angry about July's decision to scrap rail electrification to Swansea. Jessica Morden, filling in at the front bench as shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees nurses her broken foot, raised recent comments by Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies suggesting he thought the line should still be electrified and hadn't given up the ghost that it would be. Alun Cairns stuck to last month's script about bi-modal trains and, not for the first time, ignored Mr Davies's remarks. Guto Bebb came closest to committing news with his declaration that EU funds for the poorest parts of Wales had been a ""failure"". The UK government plans to replace EU funding with a UK-wide ""shared prosperity fund"" after Brexit. 'Difference' Mr Bebb told MPs: ""The reality is that structural funds in Wales did not make the difference that we anticipated. This government is committed for a shared prosperity fund for the entire United Kingdom."" He was challenged by shadow Wales Office Minister Chris Ruane, who complained there was a lack of clarity about the future of the funds and asked for the funding to be maintained after Britain leaves the EU. Mr Bebb told him: ""You raise a question about EU structural funds as if they were a success in a Welsh context. They were actually a failure in a Welsh context. £4bn of investment and yet our comparative economic performance fell. ""This government is committed to a shared prosperity fund, a shared prosperity fund which will work for the benefit of the Welsh economy rather than being wasted in the way that the Welsh Government wasted our structural fund over the past 18 years."" Mr Ruane called for a meeting between Wales Office ministers, their Labour shadows and the chancellor to ""sort these issues out"". 'Permanently' Still on Brexit, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said foreign direct investment into Wales had declined by 44% during the EU referendum year. She asked Alun Cairns: ""What will it take the secretary of state to admit that the only way to protect jobs and wages is through maintaining economic links with the EU by staying in the single market and customs union permanently?"" (Slightly clearer language, to my eyes, than we heard from Plaid Cymru during the general election or in the joint white paper with the Welsh Government). Mr Cairns replied: ""Last year was another successful year; 85 projects came to Wales creating 2,500 new jobs."" He said exports to the EU had risen by 15%, those outside the EU by 20%. He didn't address the question about the single market and customs union but the UK government's position remains (I think) that staying in them would mean not really leaving the EU at all.",Alun Cairns and Guto Bebb have been taking MPs' questions in the House of Commons.
"An inquest has been opened into the death of Jacob Billington, who was stabbed on a night out in Birmingham.

Zephaniah McLeod is charged with murder and seven counts of attempted murder. Two critically ill He allegedly left the city centre after there had been two knife attacks to go to his home in Nately Grove, Selly Oak, before returning to the area of the attacks, Det Supt Samantha Ridding from West Midlands Police told Birmingham Coroner's Court earlier. Mr Billington, a library intern, was one of eight people stabbed at four locations in and around Birmingham's Gay Village in what Det Supt Ridding told the inquest was ""an unprovoked attack"". Two of the victims remain in a critical condition in hospital - including a friend Mr Billington was enjoying a night out with, senior coroner Louise Hunt was told. The hearing has been adjourned until the conclusion of the criminal investigation.

"Sheffield council is severing ties with developer Hammerson after the company failed to deliver the £400m Sevenstone scheme in the city centre. The council had intended to continue with the scheme and find a new developer but it has now decided to go back to the drawing board. Hammerson has said ending its work with the council had been a mutual decision. New plans are expected to be unveiled by next spring. The council said it had set a target for completion of the scheme during the 2018/19 financial year. 'Decisive action' The development, currently called New Retail Quarter, will cover the same area as the Sevenstone proposal, between Barker's Pool, The Moor and Wellington Street. Councillor Leigh Bramall, cabinet member for business, skills and development at the city council, said: ""We are taking decisive and clear action to deliver a New Retail Quarter for Sheffield. ""We will bring a brand new scheme forward for the people of Sheffield, a high-class regional shopping and leisure facility that would compete with other city centres such as Manchester, Leeds and Nottingham."" The council is seeking a new development partner or investor for the scheme and said it had already been approached by several companies. Peter Cole, Hammerson's chief investment officer, said: ""We have worked very hard to achieve a retail scheme which creates a thriving city centre environment in Sheffield. We believe the city can build on our work to date.""",Plans for a new multi-million-pound retail development in Sheffield are being scrapped and completely redrawn.
"A draft strategy has been published by Bristol City Council in response to concerns the River Avon could flood regularly due to climate change. It says more than 4,100 homes and businesses in the city will be at risk of flooding by 2125 if nothing is done. A £249m flood protection scheme has been drawn up and put out to public consultation. The Bristol Avon Flood Strategy document shows about 1,100 homes and businesses near the city centre, and 200 properties in neighbouring communities, are already at risk of being flooded in either a severe river or tidal flood. It predicts 2,253 residential properties and 1,880 non-residential properties will be at risk by 2125 if no action is taken. The document states ""tidal and fluvial flooding from the River Avon represent an increasingly significant risk to Bristol and its neighbouring communities with the potential for severe consequences"". ""The city is at risk from both tidal surges from downstream and high river flows from upstream. ""Climate change is increasing sea levels and peak river flows meaning that widespread flooding of central Bristol likely to become a relatively frequent occurrence."" The report outlines plans costing £249.3m to create new flood defences or raise existing ones in places along the banks of the River Avon. It also states the tidal flood gates of Bristol's Floating Harbour are ""increasingly vulnerable to operational failure, overtopping and outflanking by flood water"". A public consultation into the strategy launched by the council is due to end on 20 December.","The centre of Bristol could suffer severe flooding each year by the end of the century, a report claims."
"Ms Rees, from Penarth, was on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child when she was made redundant. ""It stinks but it happens to women all the time,"" said Ms Rees, whose employer was a national women's charity. Ms Rees joined campaigners in the Senedd on Thursday to call for more flexible working hours for parents. Shortly after she went on maternity leave, Ms Rees described how her employer ignored her e-mails and calls. ""I assumed they were just really busy. But I was sat in bed breastfeeding my daughter when I realised they had enough time to remove my name from the website,"" she explained. Ms Rees was eventually told she was being made redundant. After a discussion with her husband, Tom, Ms Rees decided not to fight the decision. She could have taken her former employer to tribunal, but she says there is a three-month cut-off for making a claim. ""I didn't know what to do. I had lost my job and having a baby is the most expensive time of your life,"" she said. Ms Rees, who has since had a second child, Danny, who is now one, said she struggled to find work. After a brief spell self-employed, Ms Rees found the £100 a day cost for childcare too expensive and went back to being a full-time parent. ""I know so many women in senior positions who have told me that they had to make that choice,"" she added. Ms Rees, who is now studying law to help people like her, believes parents should be entitled to share the burdens of parenthood and earning. But she admits that the gender pay gap will continue to favour mums staying at home rather than dads. A 2016 survey by the Equality and Human Rights Commission revealed that the employment rate for women with dependent children in Wales is 75% compared to 91% for men. The same survey found 71% of mothers reporting negative or discriminatory experiences as a result of having children. A Welsh assembly report published in July, entitled 'Work it Out', made several recommendations to combat the problems, including: Ms Rees joned a number of campaign groups, including Mother Pukka, Pregnant Then Screwed and A Mother's Place at the National Assembly of Wales on Thursday to call on Assembly Members to implement the report's recommendations. The groups will also be staging a 'flash dance' protest outside the Capitol shopping centre on Queen Street, Cardiff, at midday on Friday.",The first Sarah Rees knew about her imminent departure from the job she loved was when her name disappeared from her employer's website.
"At least 20 roads in the county have been closed in the wake of Storm Desmond at the weekend. Michelle O'Neill said the problem is one that the local community ""will have to deal with time and time again"". Further flooding is possible as heavy rain continues to raise water levels at Upper Lough Erne, the Rivers Agency has warned. The minister rebutted criticism that it has taken her five days to visit the county and review the damage. ""I think people would prefer to see that the work is done rather than me coming down to get my picture taken,"" she said. ""For me, the priority has been to ensure that my agencies played their role and the Rivers Agency have done tremendous work on the ground. ""After any big flooding incident, you have a review of the situation and I'm sure that Transport NI will have a look at what has failed in the last week and what can be done in the future. ""One of the things the task force in 2009 highlighted was that there isn't an engineering solution to the problem in the lough. ""It's going to be a long-running problem. It's going to be here forever and a day, so what we need to do is make sure we tackle the issues when we can with things like raising roads and pumping stations."" Mrs O'Neill said she could understand the frustration of the local community. ""They have a right to be frustrated - I would be frustrated if I faced the challenges that some of the people in rural Fermanagh face. ""But to put it in context, over 110mm of water fell in one day in Fermanagh. That's the monthly average in one day. So that shows why there are significant problems this week. She commended staff who had been ""working around the clock"" to ensure roads could be opened so that the community had access to vital services. ""I think everybody understands the nature of the lough and the problems it poses for the people of Fermanagh,"" she said. ""But I think what's important is that all the agencies work together and that has very much been evident this week.""",The minister for agriculture says there is no engineering solution to flooding in County Fermanagh.

On Monday, Euell, of Catford, was jailed for three and a half years while Payne, of South Croydon, was sentenced to two years and nine months. A third suspect has not yet been found. The footage of the assault in Kingswood Road showed one officer being dragged around on the floor, while the other was left yards away from a passing bus after being kicked in the chest. The female officer was left with head injuries, while her male colleague suffered cuts and a broken rib. The Met Police said the ""despicable"" assault had a ""considerable"" impact on the two officers, as well their families and colleagues. Euell admitted two counts of assault causing actual bodily harm (ABH) and was given two sentences of 42 months and 33 months, to run concurrently. Payne pleaded guilty to one count of assault causing ABH as well as further charges of driving without insurance and driving other than in accordance with a licence. The video of the attack featured several cars driving past the encounter without stopping.

"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News They were shouted breathlessly during a now infamous presentation in 2000 in which a whooping Ballmer bounded across the stage to gee up Microsoft's employees. The clip - which saw him dubbed Mr Monkey Boy - went viral. In another performance, he perspired his way through a chant of ""developers, developers, developers"". As he announced his retirement, the 57-year-old reaffirmed his passion via a company-wide email. ""I love this company,"" he said again - but now the debate has turned to whether his company loved him. Born in Detroit, Ballmer studied mathematics and economics at Harvard, where he became close friends with Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder. In 1980, Gates hired Ballmer to be the company's first business manager at a time when the firm had just 29 people on its payroll. He held various different roles at the company over the years, including senior vice-president of sales and support, senior vice-president of systems software and vice-president of marketing. And in 2000, he took the top job, succeeding Gates as chief executive. 'Email machine' But the ""vision"", as the company put it, remained very firmly with Gates - Ballmer's legacy in technology will not be as a Steve Jobs-like innovator, but instead a salesman. Indeed, it was a slew of bad calls that critics say have been Ballmer's weakness throughout his tenure. ""Microsoft has had a lost decade, missing every big thing that has come along,"" said Dan Lyons, former technology editor at Business Week. ""When you look at the string of opportunities that Microsoft has let slip through its fingers, it's incredible."" His time at Microsoft has been peppered with foot-in-mouth moments. In 2007, in the days after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' presentation unveiling the iPhone, Ballmer dismissed the device as being ""not a very good email machine"" which wouldn't appeal to businesses because of its lack of a keyboard. ""We've got great Windows mobile devices,"" he said. Today, Apple and Google-powered phones dominate the smartphone market - while the Windows Phone is growing but minuscule in comparison. And in other areas - such as tablets - the company has been equally slow off the mark. According to the most recent figures, Microsoft has made just £562m from sales of the Surface, its tablet launched last year with great aplomb. Last month, it wrote down $900m worth of unsold stock. ""We built a few more devices than we could sell,"" Ballmer admitted. Xbox success Yet there have been several success stories during his time at the company. As chief executive, he nurtured the entertainment and devices division into a major arm of the business - the Xbox being one of the standout successes to come out of the company in recent years. In his own words, it is Microsoft's work with PCs that Ballmer regards as his greatest achievement. But it is a perceived over-reliance on this part of the business that often irked investors. Other industry leaders believe that Ballmer's oversight saw Microsoft become a company that depended on people needing its products, rather than wanting them. ""He pretty much oversaw the decline of Microsoft,"" says Jim McKelvey, co-founder of mobile payments firm Square. ""Microsoft continues to slide into more irrelevance. It's a big company, there's a lot of change that's needed there. ""I think they were very dependent on a monopolistic control. When the internet made operating systems less relevant, Microsoft could no longer force mediocre products on people."" Under Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft tripled its revenues and doubled profits. He himself will leave with a personal wealth estimated to be $15.2bn. Investors, meanwhile, are optimistic - shares in the firm jumped by 9% at the news.

"Linda YuehChief business correspondent These deep reforms to the way that the Japanese economy operates are crucial to getting growth going. Will he do enough to show that ""Japan is back""? That was his promise as he has sought to revive Japanese growth since taking office 18 months ago. Recall that Japan was the economy poised to overtake the US before the 1991 crash. Japan grew at an impressive 4% on average during the 1980s before the real estate bubble burst. Mr Abe isn't aiming for that rapid pace but for growth of 2%. That's a modest growth rate for an advanced economy, but would double the pace since the crash. It's a tall order. The OECD estimates that the potential growth of the economy is just 0.75% and points out that Japan has suffered three recessions in the last five years - due to two major shocks of the global financial crisis and the tsunami of 2011. To raise the growth rate of an economy requires more output through adding more factors and using them more efficiently. Obstacles ahead Japan has challenges on both fronts. In terms of workers, the labour force is estimated to decline by 40% by 2050 which means fewer workers to produce output. Adding women to the workforce, dubbed Womenomics, would help but a restrictive immigration system limits the other avenue of importing productive workers. The Prime Minister has announced a relaxation of immigration rules for highly skilled foreign workers but that may not be enough. Also, he's aiming for a robotics revolution. Robots as workers would be an interesting development. A rigid employment system also prevents better ""matching"" of workers to jobs. Better matching of skills to work can raise productivity. That flexibility, though, also implies higher unemployment as employees seek jobs and are ""frictionally"" unemployed and employers can hire and fire more freely. Higher unemployment is never politically easy to accept. Vested interest In terms of business, Prime Minister Abe has vowed to tackle special interests and de-regulate. As the Japanese system has been built on the basis of keiretsu corporate structures with interlinked businesses, transforming it into a more decentralised market with lots of competing firms won't happen quickly and will require taking on some of the most powerful companies to change the way that they operate. Raising investment is a key way of adding capital that can boost growth. Abe intends to cut the corporate tax rate from over 35% to below 30% and perhaps close to the OECD average of 29%. Whether taxes are holding back investment is an open question. After all, Japanese firms have high savings rates that they've invested overseas. Plus, there is a knock-on effect on government revenues that matters as Japan's government debt exceeds 200% of GDP and its primary budget deficit (budget gap minus interest payments) is estimated to be a sizeable 9% of GDP. Among a slew of announcements, there will also be reforms of the healthcare system and the Government Pension Investment Fund - a sizeable fund of $1.26 trillion that aims to invest more in stocks to better support the greying population. An attempt to raise a consumption tax to perhaps 10% by next year though has been controversial as the government seeks to raise demand to entice firms to invest and produce at home. Accurate arrows Finally, when the first iteration of this plan was unveiled last year, the reaction was lukewarm as lots of the details were left vague and to be implemented. There's still a sense of that with the formal unveiling of this plan. This is despite the success so far in the first two arrows. Notably, inflation is still to reach the 2% target but is rising by 1.3%. Deflation discourages consumers from buying as they put off purchases and thus firms will also not produce more and invest in production, so it is an important target to hit. Japan has done that through aggressive monetary easing with the central bank injecting cash until the target is met. Combating deflation requires a change in consumer attitudes and firm behaviour, so it's a more complex process than it appears. The structural reforms are likely to be even more complex. But, they, and not the first two arrows, will determine whether Japan is truly back.",Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's structural reforms comprise the third arrow which lies at the heart of his economic reform policy dubbed Abenomics - the first two arrows fired were monetary and fiscal policies.
"Detectives say the attacks happened in holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Algarve. The man, described as tanned with dark hair, is suspected of breaking in to 12 properties from 2004 to 2010. Madeleine was three when she went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Algarve, in May 2007. The five girls - aged between seven and 10 - were sexually assaulted in their beds. On one of these occasions, the man assaulted two girls in one villa. 'Serious offences' Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said the man had an ""unhealthy interest in young white female children"" - and tracing him was a priority. ""We need to establish the identity of this man,"" DCI Redwood said. ""These offences are very serious and no one has been charged in connection with them. We also need to eliminate this man from our enquiries and ascertain whether these offences are linked to Madeleine's disappearance."" Police said the man was bare-chested in some of the attacks, and some witnesses said he had a pot belly. Three victims said he had a ""noticeable odour"". Two of the families said the intruder had worn a distinctive burgundy long-sleeved top, and one family said the top had a white circle on the back. The man was said to have spoken English slowly, with a foreign accent. While not identical, many aspects of the sexual assaults were similar, police said. In most of the cases, the intruder appeared in the early hours of the morning and there were no signs of forced entry to the properties. The suspect may have been in the villa or looking around for some time before committing the offences or being disturbed, either by a parent coming in or the child waking up, officers said. He remained calm even when disturbed, they added. The incidents had previously been discounted by Portuguese investigators because they were spread over a wide geographical area and there had been no apparent attempts at abduction. Four of the 12 break-ins took place in Carvoeiro, two in Praia da Luz - where the McCanns had been staying - and six in Vale da Parra and Praia da Gale. There are currently 38 people classed as ""persons of interest"" linked with the inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance. Detectives are also sifting through details of 530 sex offenders whose whereabouts are unknown. Of those, 59 are classed as a high priority, and some of those are British. Police 'frustration' Scotland Yard launched a new investigation - codenamed Operation Grange - into Madeleine's disappearance last July, two years into a review of the case, and made renewed appeals for information. A high-profile campaign run by Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann, from Rothley, Leicestershire, and a Portuguese police investigation had so far failed to locate the missing child. The search for Madeleine was given fresh impetus in October when a BBC Crimewatch appeal that aired in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands prompted 5,000 calls. In January, British detectives flew to Portugal and spoke to local police officers there. DCI Redwood said: ""This is an offender who has got a very, very unhealthy interest in young, white, female children who he is attacking whilst they are on holiday in their beds. ""It is really critical for us to identify this offender and prove or disprove whether he was involved in Madeleine's disappearance."" Investigators in the UK have so far sent three international letters of request to Portuguese authorities over the inquiry in to Madeleine's disappearance. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said the slow legal process had caused ""frustration"". ""We know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that. But the process is the process,"" he said. Clarence Mitchell, spokesman for the McCann family, said: ""Kate and Gerry still believe that Madeleine is alive and out there to be found, and that is why they are so pleased that the British police are doing such a good job on this.""",UK police probing the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are seeking an intruder who sexually abused five girls in Portugal between 2004 and 2006.
"Locals said he had done very little to help Cobargo in New South Wales (NSW), where two people died earlier this week and many lost their homes. The PM said he was ""not surprised people are feeling very raw"". NSW's premier has declared a week-long state of emergency in response to the escalating bushfire threat. Since September, bushfires have killed 18 people and destroyed more than 1,200 homes across NSW and neighbouring Victoria. At least 17 people remain missing after fires this week alone. Thousands of people are already fleeing a vast ""tourist leave zone"" in NSW, with supplies running low in some cut-off towns. It's been called ""the largest relocation out of the region ever"". Troops are also preparing to evacuate some of the 4,000 people trapped by fires in Victoria. What happened in Cobargo? Mr Morrison was approached as he visited Cobargo, near the coast in southern NSW. ""How come we only had four trucks to defend our town? Because our town doesn't have a lot of money but we have hearts of gold, prime minister,"" one woman called out. Others joined in as Mr Morrison turned away, calling him ""an idiot"" and saying he was not welcome. ""You won't be getting any votes down here, buddy. No Liberal [party] votes - you're out, son,"" heckled one man. ""What about the people who are dead, prime minister? What about the people who have nowhere to live?"" the woman asked Mr Morrison as he was ushered away. Responding later to the hostile reception, Mr Morrison told the ABC broadcaster: ""I understand the very strong feelings people have, they've lost everything, and there are still some very dangerous days ahead. ""My job is to ensure that we steady things through these very difficult days and support the states in the response that they are providing."" Mr Morrison has also been criticised for his climate change policies. He insisted that Australia was meeting the challenge ""better than most countries"" and fulfilling international targets. But opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the government was not doing enough. ""Here's the contradiction in the government's position - they say, 'Oh, well, we're just 1.3% of [global] emissions, therefore we don't have a responsibility to act, it won't really make a difference',"" he said. ""But the truth is that, if everyone says that, of course, no-one will act."" Mr Morrison had earlier been criticised for going on holiday to Hawaii as the bushfire crisis worsened. The rising public anger at his absence eventually forced him to cut that trip short. A perfect storm There's never a single reason why wild fires escalate and, in the case of Australia, a perfect storm of different factors is involved. The country regularly sees fires but they are usually centred on bushland while the current blazes are striking forests, which burn hotter and higher so are harder to tackle. There's plenty to ignite. A programme to create firebreaks - deliberately clearing vegetation to prevent it from catching fire - has unfolded less quickly than hoped. It's slow, labour-intensive work, and expensive too. On top of all this, a pattern of unusually dry weather over the past three years culminated in the driest spring on record at the end of last year. That left many areas vulnerable to fire, particularly when 2019 also proved to be Australia's hottest on record - and warmer conditions cause more evaporation, adding to the risk. All this has sharpened Australia's divisions over climate change. A coal-rich economy that depends on fossil fuels faces new questions about its own hand in raising temperatures. What about the evacuations? The NSW state of emergency will kick in at 08:00 on Friday morning (21:00 GMT on Thursday) and last for seven days, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Thursday. It will allow local authorities to carry out forced evacuations, road closures ""and anything else we need to do as a state to keep our residents and to keep property safe"", she said. ""We don't take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we're taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday."" High temperatures and strong winds are forecast for the weekend, leading to ""widespread extreme fire danger"". The state government has warned that conditions were likely to be ""at least as bad"" as New Year's Eve, when hundreds of homes were destroyed. Earlier, fire officials told holidaymakers to urgently leave a 260km (160-mile) stretch of NSW coast before Saturday. Long lines of cars have clogged highways leading back towards Sydney and Canberra. Local media reported hour-long queues for petrol in the town of Batemans Bay, while fuel was being trucked in to the region as supplies dwindled. In some places fuel supplies ran out altogether. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of disaster for six areas and resorts, including parts of East Gippsland and the north-east of the state. A naval vessel has arrived off the coastal town of Mallacoota, near the border with NSW. Mr Andrews said the ship would take up to 800 people early on Friday. He said it could do ""multiple trips"". Defence Minister Linda Reynolds tweeted that the HMAS Choules was in position. What is happening elsewhere? In the capital Canberra - an administrative region surrounded by NSW - bushfire smoke meant air quality there was rated worse than any major global city on Thursday, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual. An elderly woman died after being exposed to the smoke as she exited a plane at Canberra airport, local reports say. Australia Post has suspended deliveries in the city ""until further notice"". Two regions of Western Australia (WA) were also facing catastrophic fire danger on Thursday, and parts of South Australia were expected to see extreme conditions on Friday. ABC reported that bushfires had forced the closure of a 330km stretch of a highway in WA, causing traffic jams. Emergency supplies including water and toilet paper were flown in to a remote guesthouse located about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Perth which has been cut off from the city by bushfires. About 120 people were on the Caiguna Roadhouse site, where temperatures were forecast to reach 48C. In Tasmania, a fire burning on the outskirts of the state capital, Hobart, was downgraded from emergency to watch and act status. Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia. However, many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow. Have you been told to evacuate?

"The power outage at the Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother (QEQM) hospital in Margate, Kent, lasted for three hours on 20 February. James Kiely, 37, admitted conspiracy to steal before the trial but denied being part of a plan to damage the cabling. He was cleared of damaging property and being reckless as to whether life was endangered at the QEQM. Four other men have pleaded guilty to causing damage after arriving at the hospital site in a stolen van and a Vauxhall Zafira with false registration plates. They will be sentenced alongside Kiely, of Shipston-on-Stour in Warwickshire, on a date yet to be fixed. Birmingham Crown Court heard cable thieves had damaged an external generator at the hospital. Jurors heard the three-hour power outage disabled a lift, forcing nurses to wrap a stroke patient in blankets and push his wheelchair around the site's perimeter Lighting, telephones and call bells were affected by the power cut, which left medical staff unable to see patients in some areas of the hospital.

"By Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News National science academies from 15 countries have called on the leading industrialised economies to pay greater heed to science and technology. The academies include those from the US, China, India and the UK. The organisations agreed three statements on tackling Earth's most pressing problems. According to Dr Michael Clegg of the US National Academy of Sciences: ""In the long term, the pressing concerns are managing the environment in a way that assures that future generations have a quality of life that's at least as equivalent to the quality of life we enjoy today."" As the host G8 nation, the US national academy has taken the lead this year, working with counterparts to draw up a co-ordinated message for the summit. For the past seven years, science academies representing countries that are attending the summit have issued statements to inform delegates of vital science and technology matters. This year, they are targeting leaders attending not just the G8 summit but also the G20, the Rio+20 environmental summit, and other important events. 'Influential' message In past G8 summits, the views of the collective academies have been influential. World leaders including Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy have previously met with representatives of the global science community and the text from their statements has ended up in the final summit communiques. ""I think most governments pay attention to science,"" says Dr Clegg ""The fact we have a consensus of a great diversity of countries is an indication of the importance of priorities that we as leaders of the global science community place on these issues"". The three so-called ""G-Science"" statements say that priority should be given to finding ways of finding a coherent way of simultaneously meeting water and energy needs, building resilience to natural disasters and developing better ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions in order to see if individual countries are meeting their international obligations to reduce emissions. The first G-Science statement called on leaders to consider water and energy as closely linked issues. Otherwise, it says, there will be shortages of both. The statement recommends that governments pursue policies that integrate the two, emphasise conservation and encourage regional and global cooperation. The second statement says more can be done to minimise the impact of major international disasters, such as a tsunami or nuclear accident. In addition to regular risk surveillance, the G-Science statement recommends building ""resilience"" to catastrophic events by, for example, improving public health systems. The third statement calls for more accurate and standardised methods to estimate human and natural sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. It recommends that all countries produce annual reports of their greenhouse gas emissions and sinks. The academies also call for greater international cooperation to share new technologies and scientific data. The statements have been signed by the leaders of the national science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the US.

"Ashya King, who has a brain tumour, was taken from Southampton General Hospital and was last seen on a ferry to France. He was allowed to leave the ward under the supervision of his parents. It has also been confirmed the family are Jehovah's Witnesses, but there is no suggestion this is why he was taken. Brett King, 51, and Naghemeh King, 45, removed him from the ward on Thursday. Assistant Chief Constable of Hampshire Chris Shead, said Ashya was fed through a battery operated tube and the battery was likely to have expired. While information had placed the family in France, he said: ""By now, we cannot be certain they have not moved on"". A spokesman for the hospital, which contacted police six hours after they left, said: ""Ashya was a long-term patient who was permitted to leave the ward under the supervision of his parents as part of his ongoing rehabilitation. ""When the length of time he had been absent became a cause of concern to staff yesterday afternoon they contacted police after a search of the site and attempts to contact the family were unsuccessful."" Interpol has issued a missing persons alert to all 190 of its member countries. It was ""treating all incoming information relating to the case as high priority"", it said. Earlier, Mr Shead said ""time was running out"" for Ashya. ""It is vital that we find Ashya today, his health will deteriorate,"" he said. ""If he doesn't receive urgent medical care, or the wrong treatment is given, his condition will become life-threatening. ""If Naghemeh or Brett or any of their children see or hear this appeal please take Ashya to the nearest hospital."" Mr Shead said they were told by the hospital the youngster was missing at 20:35 BST on Thursday - more than six hours after he had been taken by his parents. On why the hospital did not alert police sooner, he said: ""That is something that we need to look at."" Officers were keeping an ""open mind"" on the motives behind Ashya being taken, Mr Shead said. The Office of Public Information for Jehovah's Witnesses said in a statement: ""There is absolutely no indication, as far as we are aware, that their decision is in any way motivated by any religious convictions."" Checking hotels ""Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to seek the best medical treatment for themselves and their children,"" it added. It is believed Ashya's parents and six siblings boarded a cross-Channel ferry from Portsmouth to Cherbourg at 16:00 BST and arrived at 20:00. Police said Ashya, who recently had surgery, cannot communicate verbally and is immobile. He is likely to be in a wheelchair or buggy. Becky Kelly, BBC News According to Ian Pople, a consultant neurosurgeon, the battery in the feeding machine used by Ashya can't be changed easily. It is integrated within the machine, much like an iPhone, and it means the machine has to be taken apart to replace the battery. It's also not designed to be run on batteries for a long period and is usually plugged into mains. In other words, it's only battery-reliant for short periods, such as going to the toilet, or moving between wards. Cherbourg Police has confirmed it is searching locally for Ashya, checking hotels and CCTV. But vice-prosecutor Cyril Fournier said: ""They may have stayed in Cherbourg, but they may be 500km from here, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack."" An image of Ashya being wheeled out of the hospital by his father has been released by police. The force said it was working with police in France to activate emergency child rescue alert procedures. The family, from Southsea, Hampshire, were travelling in a grey coloured Hyundai I800 Style CRDI, registration KP60 HWK. Det Supt Dick Pearson, of Hampshire Constabulary, said: ""If we do not locate Ashya today there are serious concerns for his life. ""He is receiving constant medical care within the UK due to recent surgery and ongoing medical issues. Without this specialist 24 hour care, Ashya is at risk of additional health complications which place him at substantial risk. ""He needs to be taken to a medical facility for his urgent health requirements as soon as he is located."" Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Parents have the right to remove their children from hospital unless they are prevented from doing so by a court order - it has not been confirmed whether Ashya was subject to an order. If doctors are concerned that parents intend to remove a child, deny it the medical treatment it needs, and expose it to the risk of serious harm, they can seek a court order. This will normally involve CAFCASS (the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service), the non-departmental public body which provides guardians to represent the best interests of children in family court proceedings. Once an order is in place, any parent who removes their child in breach of the order is committing a contempt of court for which they could be imprisoned. Police have launched a social media appeal and are urging people to share it, particularly with friends or relatives in France and bordering countries. Ashya's paternal grandmother, Patricia King, said his parents were ""wonderful"" and had been left beside themselves at their child's plight. Speaking from her home in Southsea, she said of her son: ""He's the most caring and wonderful father you could ever have. The kids love him."" She praised her daughter-in-law, saying she had kept a bedside vigil while Ashya was in hospital. She said she did not know whether Ashya's illness was terminal, saying: ""I knew he was seriously ill, we all knew that."" Ashya's brother Naveed King posted a YouTube video on 23 July speaking about the five-year-old's illness. He said: ""I haven't slept anything really, I've been awake all night worrying. ""Everyone is sending their love now. We love you so much and we want to see you very soon and I love you so much and can't wait to see you. ""No kid at the age of five deserves to have a brain tumour.""","The health of a five-year-old boy taken from hospital by his parents against medical advice will deteriorate rapidly as the battery on his feeding system is likely to have run out, police said."
"The government pilot culls aimed to kill 70% of the badger population to test how effective, humane and safe a cull could be. Government ministers and the National Farmers' Union believe culling badgers will curb TB in cattle. Opponents say shooting the animals is not as good way to control TB. According to figures from Care for the Wild, £2.6m was spent policing the cull, farmers' costs were £1.49m, and the cost to the government was £3.2m. It said the number of badgers killed was 1,771, meaning a cost of £4,121 for each animal killed. Both Avon and Somerset Police and Gloucestershire Police refused to answer Freedom of Information requests from the BBC over the cost of policing the cull. In declining, both organisations said they ""did not have the most up-to-date costs available"" and that they ""intended to publish the figures in the future"". The cull in Gloucestershire was ended early as it had not met its targets. But the BBC understands in Gloucestershire the force spent £1.9m and in Avon and Somerset the figure was £900,000. Dominic Dyer, of Care for the Wild, said the government had delivered one of the ""most disastrous and expensive wildlife culls in history"". He said: ""It has wasted millions of pounds on a badger cull which has no scientific, animal welfare or economic justification and was carried out in an outrageously sloppy manner which would have been laughable if it hadn't cost so many badgers' lives. ""The way to solve bovine TB is by radically improving farming practices, ensuring that TB testing actually works , and ensuring infected cattle aren't moved from farm to farm."" In a statement Defra said the costs of the badger cull pilots ""are vastly outweighed by the impact that bovine TB is having on our farming industry and taxpayers"". ""Each bovine TB cattle outbreak costs an average £34,000, and if left unchecked this disease will cost the taxpayer £1bn over the next 10 years,"" it said.","Badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire have cost more than £7m - equivalent to more than £4,000 per badger killed, an animal charity says."
"Tyler Broome passed out while being spun at high speed on a park roundabout using the back wheel of a moped. His mother Dawn Hollingworth said doctors told her his injuries were usually seen in fighter pilots suffering the effects of g-force. She warned others not to copy the ""silly prank"", which could have had ""life-changing consequences"" for Tyler. The schoolboy was with a group of older children at the park in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, when he suggested they imitate the stunt, which features in hundreds of videos shared online. A video released by Ms Hollingworth, 51, shows him spread-eagled across the top of the roundabout as it spins around. At the end of the recording, he appears to fall down, his head flopping forward as the equipment comes to a stop. 'Could have had stroke' Blood rushed to the youngster's head, causing swelling and bruising to his face, Ms Hollingworth said. ""The clips I have seen, everybody gets chucked off,"" she said. ""In Tyler's case he passed out from the g-force. ""His vision is all blurred and his eyes are red, filled with blood,"" she said. ""He got off, he was sick and dropped to his knees and passed out again on the field."" The teenagers Tyler was with left him alone in the park when he became unwell. But he was helped by another boy who was passing by, his mum said. ""The doctors said if he was not fit and healthy he could have quite easily had a stroke and died."" Ms Hollingworth said she wanted to raise awareness of the dangers of the stunt . ""Tyler is aware he has done wrong and his injuries are caused by his own stupidity. ""But once he was unconscious he was unable to consent but they carried on and left him."" Doctors likened Tyler's injuries to those sustained by fighter pilots when they are not wearing an oxygen mask, Ms Hollingworth said. Medics asked for her consent to write a medical paper, as they had never seen a case like it, she said. Nottinghamshire Police has appealed for witnesses, or anyone else with video of Wednesday's incident, to come forward. The force said Tyler sustained serious head injuries and remained in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News For the first time, scientists at the new MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection at Imperial College London have used scanning equipment to watch an infection unfurl, in real time, inside an animal. ""I saw this and just said wow!"" was the instant response of Prof Gadi Frankel, when he first viewed the scans. ""This allows us for the first time to visualise infection in 3D in real time."" The video shows bacteria infecting the small intestine, retreating to a small pocket in the digestive tract and the booming in numbers as they spread to the rectum then all over the large intestine. The later scans show the immune system driving the bacteria back and the mouse clearing the infection. Bacterial light It works by measuring tiny quantities of light produced by the bacteria, which escape from inside the mouse. The researchers used a genetically modified version of a mouse bug, Citrobacter rodentium, which produces light. Dr James Collins, who works in Prof Frankel's lab, then puts the infected mice inside the scanner. ""It is a dark box which keeps the animals warm and blocks any other light from coming in. It has a camera at the top so we can very sensitively measure any light that's emitted through the mouse by the bacteria."" He then uses the measurements to build up a map of the exact location of the bacteria in different parts of the body. The amount of light escaping shows how many bacteria there are. More light means more bacteria and if the light starts to go out then that means the bacteria are being killed off. Repeating these scans, with the same mouse, day after day, builds a complete picture of an infection. The equipment can also be configured to look in exquisite detail at the immune system. Dr Collins said: ""We can image where the bacteria are and where and which types of immune cells have been recruited to that area."" 'Revolution' Prof Frankel said: ""It is something which will revolutionise the way we study bacterial infection, this is the future."" He hopes this technology will help with some of the most pressing issues in medicine. ""The big problem of course is the rise of antibiotic resistance, this is the major challenge we are facing at the moment,"" he said. There are also issues about new emerging bugs such as the E. coli O104 outbreak in Germany last year and the constant need for new and better vaccines. ""We would be able to visualise how antibiotics and vaccination works in a living animal - that's something which was never done before. ""It will give us incredibly important tools to develop better vaccines and better antibiotics, which will allow us to tackle bacterial infections in the future,"" Prof Frankel added. The scans would show how different vaccines and antibiotics change the way bacteria take over different parts of the body, which could help researchers screen for the most promising options. They have also done some experiments with probiotic yoghurts. They have shown that using ""good bacteria"" changes the way an infection takes hold, which may benefit the mouse. Dr James Collins concluded: ""We're only just scratching the surface of what we're able to do with it really.""",What does an infection look like as it takes hold in the body? Where does it spread to and when? When does the immune system kick in and drive the infection off?
"The Fed has only raised interest rates three times in the last decade - most recently in March - in a bid to encourage economic growth. But Ms Yellen said the US economy was now ""healthy"" and required less help from the central bank. Investors were unmoved by Ms Yellen's comments, with yields on US Treasury bonds little changed. Ms Yellen said that ""before we had our foot pressed down on the gas pedal trying to give the economy all the oomph we possibly could"". ""Now allowing the economy to kind of coast and remain on an even keel - to give it some gas but not so much that we are pressing down hard on the accelerator - that's a better stance of monetary policy,"" she said at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy.

"Oliver McGowan, 18, from Bristol, was being treated for a seizure at the city's Southmead Hospital in 2016 when he was given Olanzapine to sedate him. His inquest said a rare side-effect of the drug contributed to his death. Avon and Somerset Police said it would ""interview a number of individuals"" as part of its inquiry. The force said it would then seek advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. It is understood no arrests have been made. Oliver, from Emerson's Green, was mildly autistic and had epilepsy and learning difficulties. 'Ignored in life' He was admitted to hospital on 22 October 2016 after suffering a seizure and was prescribed Olanzapine on 25 October to manage any potential psychosis. At his inquest, in 2018, his parents said they had repeatedly insisted he should not be given the drug because he had reacted badly to it in the past and because he did not have a mental health diagnosis. Oliver's temperature rose after being give the drug and he showed signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) - a rare side-effect. He died on 11 November. The coroner ruled the medication was appropriately prescribed but concluded Olanzapine had caused Oliver to suffer from NMS, which was a ""a significant contributory factor"" in his death. In a statement, his mother Paula McGowan said: ""Oliver's voice was wilfully ignored in life and up until now has been muted in death. ""We embrace the police doing a full and thorough investigation. Oliver made it clear to paramedics and doctors he was not to be administered anti-psychotic medication. ""We, as Oliver's parents, knew him best and told all doctors that we did not give permission for anti-psychotic medication to be administered."" A North Bristol NHS Trust spokesperson said: ""We will not be commenting on an ongoing police investigation.""",The death of a teenager who was prescribed medication against his and his parents' wishes is being investigated by police.

"Some are potentially overpaying by more than £400 a year, according to the consumer watchdog. Last year Ofcom asked operators to reduce prices to out-of-contract customers from February this year. Operators, however, said they were offering customers plenty of choice. Many customers choose to get a new smartphone through a monthly bill contract, effectively paying off most of its cost over a year or two. After the contract term ends, there is no longer a need to pay off a handset, so prices could drop. But that is not always the case. 'Worst offenders' According to Which, the worst-affected were customers of Three, where about four in 10 customers whose contracts ended in the last six months claimed they saw no price drop. Two in five EE customers and three in 10 Vodafone users said the same. On the other hand, O2, Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile told customers that when their contracts ended their bills would reduce to the best available airtime deal. Examples given by Which? included: Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, said: ""While some mobile firms have taken action to end overpayments, our research suggests that others could do a lot more to ensure that customers are not being exposed to rip-off charges. ""Ofcom should ensure that all providers are treating their customers fairly and have taken enough steps to stop people overpaying. ""In the meantime, it is really important that customers don't wait. If you think you might be out of contract or overpaying, check your phone bills to see if you can save money with a sim-only deal or with an upgrade to a new phone."" Discounts EE said that the out-of-contract payment assumptions used in the report were ""misleading"". Instead of comparing prices with year-long contracts, it said ""it is fairer to compare out-of-contract pricing with a 30-day sim-only deal, as that's the equivalent notice an out-of-contract customer gives"". It said such a ""closer comparison"" meant that the sim-only customer paid about £5 a month more than an out-of-contract one. ""Since May 2020, we automatically give handset customers a 10% discount off their monthly bills once they have been out-of-contract for three months,"" it said, adding that it makes sure customers are ""fully informed"". Three said: ""Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping customers find a contract which is both best suited to their needs and priced fairly."" It said it allowed customers to choose what they wanted to do at the end of their contract. ""To ensure that they can make an informed choice, we send all customers a notification before the end of their contract which shows them what they are paying for now, what an equivalent sim-only tariff is, and also a sim-only tariff based on their actual usage."" Vodafone also questioned the survey, telling the BBC that Which? had only spoken to 81 Vodafone users ""with no guarantee any of them was the account holder"". It added: ""We have sent more than 1.3 million alerts so far this year. For those customers who don't respond within three months of their contract ending, we automatically apply a 5% discount to their bill.""","Mobile customers are being ""ripped off"" by operators who continue to charge them the full price of their contracts even when they have paid off the cost of their phone, says Which?"
"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News The main automotive sponsor of the Games wants to use the event to showcase its green technology. Some 4,000 BMW vehicles will roam the streets of the UK capital next summer, with many of them electric or petrol-electric hybrids. In addition, conventional diesel-powered cars will be used, BMW said. Unveiling the largest car that will be used, a BMW 520d that can travel 63 miles on a gallon of diesel whilst emitting just 119 g/km carbon dioxide, Ian Robertson, BMW Group's global sales and marketing director, insisted the company has ""driven our carbon dioxide emissions down more than any other car company, particularly in the premium sector"". BMW has reduced its average emissions by 5.1% in the last year alone, versus 3.4% for Audi and 3.3% for Mercedes. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index has named BMW Group the ""most sustainable automobile company worldwide"" six years in a row. This, Mr Robertson pointed out, helped BMW to win the Olympics contract, as the company complied with London's demand for a fleet of low emission vehicles. It should also be a distinct competitive advantage that could help it to boost sales from 1.6 million cars this year and to two million by 2020, he predicted. ""Just like safety was part of premium in the 1970s, sustainability is part of premium today,"" Mr Robertson said. In Europe, where there is a greater focus on emissions than elsewhere in the world, average carbon dioxide emissions from the BMW fleet have fallen to 146g/km, though this belies the company's reliance on sales of larger and considerably thirstier models in the markets where growth is the strongest, such as Asia and the US. Indeed, while putting considerable effort into making low emission models, BMW is also clinging to its image as a producer of high-performance cars with big, powerful - and thus thirsty - engines. Such apparently conflicting values are likely to result in further ""brand separation"" in the future, where the company adopts different marketing strategies for, for instance, its electric sub-brand BMW i and its high performance, and far from green, sub-brand BMW M. Bikes and scooters BMW is also moving beyond its core activities of building cars and motorcycles, and working on different products. In cities in particular, cars may not always be the best vehicles to get around, so the company is working to develop both different vehicles and new services. BMW is using the Olympics as a platform to launch products in new market segments. It is adding a pedelec - or an electric bicycle - to its range of bikes, and is launching a range of scooters. ""The scooter market around the world has been growing dramatically in recent years, particularly in urban environments,"" Mr Robertson said, pointing to how small motorcycle and scooter sales have doubled to about 40 million a year in recent years, while large bike sales have dropped in the past five years from about 1.5 million to about 750,000. Some 200 electric Mini and BMW cars will also be part of the 2012 Olympic fleet. ""Electric vehicles are definitely part of the future solutions,"" Mr Robertson said, though he forecast that conventional petrol and diesel engines would remain the dominant technology for several decades yet. 'Mobility solutions' The range of new services, as opposed to products, is still being developed. Many of them have been dreamt up by partners operating outside the motor industry, Mr Robertson said. To encourage them, BMW has created a $100m venture capital fund, named BMW i Ventures, that will invest in small start-up companies. So far, the fund has invested in a project called MyCityWay, which allows people to look at live traffic cameras on their smartphones to help them chose whether to drive, take the tube or ride a bike to where they are going. It has also invested in ParkatmyHouse, which makes more parking available for drivers while earning home owners a crust. With about a third of drivers in cities looking for a place to park at any one time, this should help improve traffic flow and thus cut overall emissions, Mr Robertson reasoned. ""Mobility solutions of the future have become an integral part of the car industry, so either you get onboard or you're in real trouble,"" he said.","BMW has unveiled a range of cars, motorcycles and bicycles that will be used during the 2012 Olympics in London."
"Prosecutors had argued that Dara Singh should face death - the sentence originally awarded by a lower court. Australian Graham Staines and his sons were burned alive by a mob in 1999 in a village in the eastern state of Orissa, where he worked with leprosy patients. Hardline Hindu groups had accused him of forcibly converting poor Hindus. The two-judge Supreme Court bench turned down federal prosecutors' demands for the death sentence, saying the case of Dara Singh was not ""the rarest of the rare"" - the only justification for handing down the death penalty in India. ""We hope Mahatma Gandhi's vision of religion playing a positive development integrating into a prosperous nation will be realised,"" the judges said. ""There is no justification for interfering in someone's belief through force, conversion or false premise that one religion is better than the other."" Mr Staines had spent 30 years working with leprosy patients in Orissa. His sons were aged eight and 10 at the time of their murder. Christian community leaders accused a militant Hindu group, the Bajrang Dal, over the killings, but an official inquiry found no evidence that any one group was behind the attack. After a lengthy trial Singh and 12 others were convicted in 2003. But the High Court in Orissa commuted his death sentence two years later. It also freed 11 others given life terms in prison, saying there was not enough evidence to support their convictions.",The Indian Supreme Court has upheld the life sentence of a man convicted of killing Christian missionary Graham Staines and his two young sons in 1999.

"As part of the Wales Bill, ministers would get the power to vary income tax after a Yes vote in a referendum. The UK government has insisted on a ""lock-step"" system that stops Wales varying tax bands individually. But Mr Crabb said planned powers for Scotland if it remains in the UK after the referendum could spark a re-think. ""I've always been open minded,"" he said. ""I think as Scotland is getting a new swathe of tax powers I think it is right that we look again at the lock step and probably sooner rather than later."" Short-changed Under current plans, if the Welsh government decided to cut the basic rate by 1p, it would have to cut all other rates of income tax by 1p too. First Minister Carwyn Jones has described the system as ""pretty much useless"" and the plan caused a split in the Conservative assembly group. Mr Crabb also suggested there could be moves to deal with a perception that Wales is short-changed by the system for distributing money around the UK, known as the Barnett Formula. The three UK party leaders have promised not to alter the formula for Scotland in a bid to encourage a No vote. A cross-party commission in 2009 found that while Scotland was well-served by the system, Wales was under-funded by about £300m a year. ""The work of the Holtham Commission which identified this £300m figure, that's important work we're looking at closely at UK government level,"" said Mr Crabb. ""I think going forward as part of this re-think of the British constitution, yes we do need to be looking at funding issues as they apply to Wales."" Public spending in Wales is £9,709 per head, per year; in England it's £8,529 per head but in Scotland it is £10,152.","Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb says planned restrictions on new tax powers for the Welsh government could be removed ""sooner rather than later""."
"They marched from the US embassy to Trafalgar Square - as part of UK-wide rallies to highlight women's rights. Organisers said up to 100,000 people took part in London, although that has not been independently verified. It comes on a day of global protests, with the biggest demonstration taking place in the US capital, Washington DC. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Washington - one of more than 600 rallies taking place worldwide on the new US president's first full day in office. UK demonstrations have also been held in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol. Protesters left the US embassy, in London's Grosvenor Square, shortly after midday and chanted ""build bridges not walls"" as they made their way along Piccadilly. TV presenter Sandi Toksvig and Labour MP Yvette Cooper later addressed crowds, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was also in attendance. London organisers announced on stage that between 80,000 and 100,000 women and men had taken part in the rally, but police have not given an independent estimate. Eleanor Hallam, 26, was among those marching in London. She said she was there ""out of solidarity for all the women and other groups marginalised by Trump's politics"". Hannah Webb, 26, who travelled from South Wales to London, added: ""When social media feeds you fear, it feels good to march together shoulder to shoulder."" Nic Bash, an American now living in London, said he had attended ""because if you don't like something you have to try and change it"". Politicians, activists and celebrities took to the stage to address the crowds in Trafalgar Square. Ms Toksvig, who co-founded the Women's Equality Party, said: ""I am here today because I believe in a woman's right to choose."" Ms Cooper told the rally: ""When the most powerful man in the world says it's okay to sexually assault women because you are rich and powerful, we have to stand up and say no way."" Hollywood actress Rebecca Hall said it was ""important for me to march in solidarity"" in London. The half American, half British actress added: ""Yesterday was a confusing day and a sad day - I was sad to see Obama leave."" At the scene Cherry Wilson, BBC News ""Stand united, we will never be divided"", was the message chanted by the crowd as people marched through central London. Cheers erupted every few minutes as the crowd held up placards to the beat of drum and bass music from a portable sound system. Pink, heart-shaped balloons and messages to Donald Trump were carried by the crowd with people travelling from as far as Scotland to attend the march. ""It's sending a message of solidarity,"" said Valuska Andrews, 49, who had come from Edinburgh. ""We want progressive politics and the truth. It's about people supporting each other."" Her sister Ludi, from south London, added: ""Women's rights is a huge issue. We have had choice and we want our daughters to have that."" Read more from Cherry. A protest against Mr Trump also took place at London's US embassy on Friday night. Singer Lily Allen joined demonstrators, local politicians and trades unionists to highlight concerns raised by his election campaign on issues including nuclear weapons, climate change and immigration. Protests also happened in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester as Mr Trump was being sworn in as the 45th US president. Celebrities such as Katy Perry, Scarlett Johansson, Amy Schumer, Ugly Betty star America Ferrera, Patricia Arquette and Michael Moore are all expected to have attended the Washington DC rally. Events are also being held in cities across the US - from New York to Seattle - while hundreds of so-called sister marches are held around the globe. Protests have already taken place in Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as Asian cities such as Bangkok. Several thousand women and men joined a rally in central Sydney, with a similar number in Melbourne. Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam, Geneva, Budapest, Prague and Berlin were among European cities holding rallies.",Thousands of protesters have taken part in a Women's March in London as part of an international campaign on the first full day of Donald Trump's presidency.
"Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also urged an intensification of efforts to find a political solution to the war. Mr Lavrov was speaking after meeting his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US. On Thursday, President Putin suggested the Syrian regime could be ready to work with some rebel groups against the so-called Islamic State. Mr Putin said President Assad had agreed to the idea on a recent visit to Moscow, Speaking at the start of talks in Vienna on Friday, Mr Lavrov said: ""Our common position is that we need to boost efforts for the political process in the Syrian settlement. ""This foresees the start of full-scale talks between representatives of the Syrian government and the full spectrum of the Syrian opposition, both domestic and external - with the support of outside players."" Mr Lavrov did not define exactly which opposition groups should be included. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who also attended, said the talks had been ""constructive"" and that an expanded round of negotiations could take place next week. The US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia all support rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. Russia backs President Assad and hosted him on Tuesday in a visit criticised by the US. Russia has been bombing targets in Syria since last month. It says it is primarily hitting IS, but Western powers say most of the air strikes have hit rebel groups, including those backed by the West and Gulf states. 'Successful offensive' However, Vladimir Putin's spokesman said on the BBC's HARDtalk programme that Russia's intervention in Syria was not an attempt to prop up President Assad but rather an attempt to save the country and the region from falling under the sway of terrorists. Dmitry Peskov said a political settlement was impossible without dialogue with the ""legitimate president"" of Syria. And he echoed Mr Putin's speech at the Valdai discussion forum by saying all the ""serious"" rebel forces in Syria were ""terrorists"". Mr Peskov said the West had so far failed to identify any ""balanced opposition"" to Mr Assad that did not have links to jihadists. The US-led air campaign against the so-called Islamic State had led to IS controlling two-thirds of the country's territory, Mr Peskov argued, but there were now signs the Syrian army - backed by Russian air strikes - was mounting a successful offensive against rebels. Mr Peskov also said Russia wanted to exchange military information with the US, including about targets of air strikes, but this had not been forthcoming. Controversial weapon - Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic and defence correspondent YouTube video from the fighting in Syria has thrown up images of a rarely seen Russian weapons system - the TOS-1 ""Buratino"" multiple rocket launcher. Described by the Russians as a ""heavy flame-thrower"", it is a highly controversial weapon and its appearance in Syria raises the question as to who is actually operating it. The TOS-1 fires a 220mm rocket that is designed to carry a thermobaric warhead. Sometimes known as a ""fuel-air explosive"" the rockets detonates at a set altitude above the ground, releasing a cloud of fuel which is then ignited by a second explosion. This creates a huge temperature and pressure wave whose impact has been likened to a low-yield nuclear explosive. It is very much an indiscriminate weapon, typically used to support offensive operations by blanketing given areas with fire. Thermobaric weapons were used to devastating effect by the Russians in Afghanistan. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. What's the human cost? More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.","Syria's ally Russia says there should be talks between the Syrian government and the ""full spectrum"" of opposition."
"By Andres SchipaniBBC News, La Paz The leaves were seized in numerous operations by Bolivia's police to stop them reaching cocaine producers. But Bolivia's anti-drugs chief Felipe Caceres warns that ""we are running out of storage space"". For many in Bolivia and elsewhere, this is clear proof that the country's cocaine industry is growing at an alarming rate. There is further evidence. Cocaine seizures have been increasing and laboratories using processing methods long used in Colombia are mushrooming. And, for the first time in Bolivia, there is drug-related violence. Recent months have seen a number of shoot-outs between gangs of drug-smugglers. ""We are seizing more and more [cocaine], and more and more traffickers, that are increasingly violent. That's true; we cannot deny that,"" the head of Bolivia's anti-drugs force, Col Felix Molina, told the BBC. ""The processing labs are increasingly sophisticated and can produce more and more cocaine."" Jose Carlos Campero, a leading political economist, says cocaine trafficking is already a major problem and will continue to be so for the next decade. ""We've seen a 70% growth in the cocaine industry in recent years. That means that, today, the coca-cocaine circuit is the third largest source of revenue for the country, right after the exports of traditional products such as hydrocarbons and mining."" Re-think From Colombia and Peru through Mexico and on to several West African states, the cocaine trail is littered with violence. That is not yet the case in Bolivia, but the recent shoot-outs are ringing alarm bells. ""What we fear are the increasing levels of violence; we fear this could turn into something similar to what Colombia was suffering 10 years ago, or what Mexico is suffering right now"", Mr Campero says. The violence is forcing a partial re-think of the drugs policy adopted by President Evo Morales since he came to power in 2006. Like many in the indigenous Indian community, Mr Morales grew coca for traditional uses - such as tea, medicine and indigenous rituals - and, as president, he has allowed cultivation for such purposes. He is also a critic of Washington. He has summed up his attitude several times in public, saying: ""Long live the coca leaf, death to the Yankees."" Two years ago, he expelled the US anti-drugs agents invited in by previous presidents and made local security forces entirely responsible for all rooting out the cocaine business. It is a policy of ""zero cocaine but not zero coca"". But Bolivian police are struggling to contain the spread of cocaine production in what is a strikingly poor country. UN, US and independent local studies estimate that coca is being grown illegally on around 30,000 hectares. Many believe more coca will inevitably mean more cocaine. Since the early 1980s, Bolivia has been the world's third-largest producer of cocaine after Colombia and Peru, with Europe as its main market. But now increasing amounts of cocaine are being produced in Bolivia, as Colombian producers set up shop deep in the Bolivian jungle. ""The situation is in danger of getting out of control… we are very worried,"" European diplomatic sources told the BBC. They added that, in their view, the departure of US agents has left Bolivia vulnerable to the emergence of drug cartels in isolated coca-growing areas. Bolivian anti-drugs forces acknowledge the scale of the battle. ""We are doing the best we can, but we lack resources and we feel abandoned by the international community, and this should be a concern for them,"" says Col Molina. President Morales has recently responded by turning to an old friend and big neighbour, Brazil, and one of Bolivia's newest allies, Russia. Russia is set to supply helicopters to Bolivia to help in the fight against the illegal drugs trade while Brazil, another major destination for Bolivia's cocaine, will help with intelligence and anti-drugs forces. However, with new foreign help or not, the reality is that in one of South America's poorest countries coca leaves fetch far higher prices than most food crops. The temptation to sell them to the highest bidder is hard to resist. ""Fighting drug criminals is difficult,"" says Col Molina. ""But what it is even more difficult is fighting people who are trying to get out of poverty.""","In a basement in La Paz used as an improvised warehouse, millions and millions of coca leaves - cocaine's raw material - are stockpiled in white, grey and blue bags."
"New York based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said both Karuna group and the Tamil Tigers continue recruiting children onto combat despite repeated assurances to the international community. The HRW activists have witnessed armed children under 17 working in Karuna groups offices in Batticaloa. The Sri Lanka security force personnel have failed to take any action against the group, the watchdog said in a statement. Sri Lanka government pledged to investigate after a United Nations special envoy accused elements of armed forces of supporting Karuna group's child recruitment. Allan Rock report Defence Affairs spokesman, Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, repeatedly said the government would launch an investigation into Alan Rock's special report on child recruitment. But the HRW says it witnessed many armed children working in the Thamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) offices in eastern Sri Lanka. ""When government troops at a military base look across the street at children standing guard at a Karuna office and do nothing, it's hard to believe the government is taking any meaningful steps to end this abuse,"" said HRW's Asia director, Brad Adams. The Rights group says the group led by former senior LTTE leader Karuna have re-abducted some of the children after releasing them. The record of the Tamil Tigers on child recruitment is not different tho that of Karuna group, according to HRW. Sanctions against LTTE Quoting UNICEF figures the rights group says while Karuna group has abducted 45 children since last December, the LTTE has forcibly recruited at least 28 since January. Authorities at sacred Madhu church also accused LTTE of forcibly recruiting young adults who have sought refuge in the church. ""We have strongly told the LTTE not to come and recruit people here because this is shrine this is only for religious activities,"" Rev. Fr. Emilius Pillai told bbcsinhala.com. Though there were no reports of child recruitment, young adults as young as 17 years have been forced to join the LTTE, according to Fr. Emilius Pillai. ""Access to LTTE-controlled areas remains difficult, but credible reports indicate that the group is increasingly recruiting and deploying girls as front line soldiers in the East,"" the HRW statement issued on Thursday said. The HRW has called on the UN to impose targeted sanctions on Tamil Tigers as they have a ""long history of recruiting children in violation of international law"". The watchdog says both groups have repeatedly broken their pledges to stop the illegal practise. ""The LTTE is a notorious repeat offender of child recruitment,"" Brad Adams said. ""It's a shame that government forces complicit with the Karuna group are now involved in the same ugly practice."" There is also strong evidence that the government forces are colluded with the Karuna group, according to the LTTE. Karuna- SLA 'colaboration' ""In February, Human Rights Watch saw a Karuna commander named Jeyam riding atop a Sri Lankan armored personnel vehicle outside Valaichchenai. In Batticaloa town, residents have seen Karuna cadre patrolling jointly with the police,"" the statement said. The HRW has accused the government of deliberately preventing family members of the abducted children when a one man commission travelled to Batticaloa in January. The military also pressurised the families to say their children were taken away by ""unidentified group,"" according to the HRW. The watchdog urged Sri Lanka authorities to take actions against Karuna group's child abductions. ""The Karuna group is doing the government's dirty work,"" HRW said.",The Sri Lanka government is accused of failing to live up to its pledges to investigate child recruitment by LTTE splinter group led by V Muralitharan alias Karuna.
"It is the first step towards overturning the convictions of postmasters accused of fraud or theft after using the Horizon IT system. Their lawyer said they could ""now walk with their heads held high"" after the ruling which ends years of campaigning. It comes after the Post Office had said it would pay £58m to settle claims. Last week the Post Office had acknowledged problems with the IT system but Monday's judgment has been made as part of a court case launched before that settlement was reached. In the case, brought by six lead claimants, the judge looked at allegation that the system contained a large number of software defects, which caused shortfalls with sub-postmasters and postmistresses' accounts. In Monday's High Court judgment, Mr Justice Fraser said the Horizon IT system was not ""remotely robust"" and even when improved it had a significant number of bugs. He said there was a ""material risk"" that shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts were caused by the system. The Post Office workers blame the system for creating big shortfalls in their accounts, discrepancies which led to some being made bankrupt and others prosecuted and sent to prison. Homes, businesses and reputations have been lost, as well as years spent in prison. Among those involved in the case is Seema Misra, who was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She was accused of theft after using the Post Office Horizon IT system, which is provided by Fujitsu. Seema became a sub-postmistress in West Byfleet in Surrey in June 2005 and was suspended in January 2008 after an audit found a discrepancy of £74,000 in her accounts. She had been feeding at least £100 per day from her shop into the Post Office tills, because of discrepancies in balancing the accounts. One day there was a £10,000 hole. This went on for two years, she said, with very little support from the Post Office. ""If I hadn't had been pregnant, I definitely would have killed myself,"" she said. ""It was the worst thing. It was so shameful."" She is now focused on trying to get her conviction overturned. Another worker, Rubbina Shaheen is also among those fighting to clear her name. She ran the Greenfields post office in Shrewsbury and was convicted and jailed in 2010 and while she is not one of the 557 Post Office claimants, but is now hoping her conviction will be overturned. Long-running dispute The 400-page judgment comes after the Post Office had agreed a payout with 557 claimants after a long-running dispute over the system. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates miscarriages for justice, is looking into more than 30 criminal convictions of former sub-postmasters. James Hartley, partner at Freeths law firm which represented the claimants, said: ""This judgment is vindication for the claimant group of postmasters - they have finally been proved to have been right all along when they have said that the Horizon system was a possible cause of shortfalls in their branch accounts. ""These claimants can now walk with their heads held high after all these years. ""This judgment, together with the settlement reached last week, are important stepping stones to achieving much-needed closure for these postmasters. ""They can now start to move on with their lives."" Mr Justice Fraser said he would refer the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions after evidence given by employees of Fujitsu, which developed and maintained the Horizon system, in previous court cases. He said: ""Based on the knowledge that I have gained, I have very grave concerns regarding veracity of evidence given by Fujitsu employees to other courts in previous proceedings about the known existence of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system."" 'Re-set relationship' Post Office Chairman, Tim Parker, said the judgment acknowledged that the current Horizon system was robust and related to previous version of the systems. ""In reaching last week's settlement with the claimants, we accepted our past shortcomings and I, both personally and on behalf of the Post Office, sincerely apologised to those affected when we got things wrong. We have given a commitment to learning lessons from these events, and today's judgment underlines the need to do so."" ""Importantly, our new chief executive [Nick Read] has made clear the need to reset our relationship with postmasters and started the process to build a much better relationship with them.""",Hundreds of post office workers have won a key victory against the Post Office and the controversial accounting software they were forced to use

The government said social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they serve substantial meals. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including Conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The tier three regulations, which came into effect earlier this month, appeared not to include private members clubs because they operate under a different law which means, in effect, the members own the drink already. Preston Council posted advice stating membership based social clubs ""do not sell alcohol, instead they supply alcohol to their members"". ""Therefore the requirement to close does not apply to these premises and nor do these premises need to provide a substantial meal to club members or their guests when they are drinking"". The British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive Emma McClarkin said the organisation was ""aware of this inconsistency and are raising it with government to get clarity"". ""Given the circumstances they find themselves in, it is vital, more than ever, that pubs have a level-playing field with clear guidance,"" she added. Mill Hill Working Men's Club in Blackburn posted on Facebook that it is planning to reopen on Friday, prompting some to celebrate and others to condemn the move. Blackburn with Darwen has the highest rate of new cases of Covid-19 in England, with 1,176 new cases recorded in the seven days to October 23 - the equivalent of 785.6 cases per 100,000 people. One person commented on the post, saying: ""Surely can't be able to open without selling substantial meals. If this is allowed it will without doubt open a can of worms. If clubs can open then why not pubs?"" Another said: ""Out of respect for other publicans you should stay shut"". Club owners responded to one of the comments, saying: ""Please read the statement! We contacted the Council!"" Blackburn with Darwen Council said it is ""awaiting urgent clarification"" from government ""and will provide an update as soon as possible"". 'Muddled' Wallasey Conservative Club treasurer Charlie White, 75, said he was ""happy to re-open"" and ""didn't agree with being locked down in the first place"". He said the Wirral club has all the Covid measures in place and is safe but that he thinks the loophole is ""likely to be closed soon"". The Association of Conservative Clubs (ACC) noted the confusion on its website but said it does not consider this interpretation of the rules to be ""the government's intention"". The ACC, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". It is unclear whether social clubs choosing to remain closed will receive the enhanced tier three financial support packages. The ACC said it ""will be heavily pushing"" for such clubs to get the enhanced support ""even if the actual legislation has become muddled"" about whether it had to close. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are asking everybody to play their part to reduce potential periods of exposure in an indoor environment. ""For areas in very high local alert levels, any pub, bar or other business, including social or members clubs, cannot sell alcohol for consumption on the premises unless it is served alongside a substantial meal."" On Saturday, South Yorkshire joined Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Liverpool City Region in the highest level. Warrington moved into tier three on Tuesday and will be followed by Nottinghamshire on Friday.",An apparent loophole in government rules has caused confusion over whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol.
"By Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland education correspondent Members of the EIS Further Education Lecturers' Association want to see more action taken to end differences in pay between colleges. The first 24-hour strike is planned for next Thursday. Colleges Scotland, which represents colleges, said the dispute was ""unnecessary"" and progress was being made to address the union's concerns. But, the union said if the dispute was not settled by the middle of next month they will strike for three days every week. The proposed strike dates are: The dispute is, in effect, a continuation of one which last year led to the first national strike in Scotland's colleges for decades. A similar programme of escalating action was planned then but a deal was struck after one day of action. Senior figures within the union are hopeful the dispute will be resolved without the need to escalate action. They believe there could be political pressure to solve the dispute quickly because of both the council elections and the general election campaign. Colleges have been through a huge shake-up in recent years, merging into so-called regional super-colleges with national pay bargaining reintroduced. Colleges had previously been free to set their own terms and conditions. But the union has highlighted examples of lecturers doing virtually identical jobs at different colleges, but with pay as much as £10,000 apart.",Scottish college lecturers are planning an escalating programme of national strikes in a dispute over pay.

"Francis Corr was giving evidence to the inquest that is examining the deaths of 10 people at Ballymurphy in 1971. He was speaking about the deaths of Father Hugh Mullan and Francis Quinn. They were shot near Springfield Park on 9 August 1971 - they had been trying to help another man, Bobby Clarke, who had already been wounded. Mr Clarke had been spending time taking children from the area to safety as their homes were being attacked. He survived the incident and is due to give evidence in person to the inquest tomorrow. Mr Corr said he had heard of rioting in the area and wanted to check that a friend who lived there was safe, even though he had never been to the Springfield Park area before. When he arrived, shooting broke out and he took cover near a patch of waste ground. He told the inquest he saw Mr Clarke being shot and went to try and help him, with Mr Quinn running behind him to help. He found Fr Mullan also trying to help Mr Clarke and giving him the last rites. Who were the victims? Mr Corr said that Mr Quinn eventually made a run towards the grounds of a factory, in spite of being told that he might be shot. Mr Quinn almost made it, said the witness, before being shot and falling to the ground. 'Waving white hanky' Mr Corr told the inquest that the death of Mr Quinn had bothered him ""because for a long time I felt responsible"". He said that shortly after the shooting, Fr Mullan was shot and flipped over, starting to moan in pain. He said the priest had been shot while waving a white handkerchief. A man beside the priest had a clearly visible first aid box with a large red cross on it, he added. It was after that that Mr Corr crossed himself, said a prayer and ran for safety, making it to flats at nearby Moyard Park, he said. He said that after darkness that evening a man showed him a safer way to his own home by another route. 'Can't deal with it' Mr Corr was asked by a barrister for the Ministry of Defence why he had not made a statement about the incident to anyone for almost 40 years. Visibly upset and dabbing at tears with a tissue, Mr Corr replied: ""It's not that I want to forget what happened. ""I can't live with the pain of it... people can't deal with it."" ""I'm only coming to terms with it myself now,"" he added. Mr Corr will continue his evidence on Tuesday.","A man who witnessed the shooting of three men - two of whom died - in west Belfast almost 50 years ago has said he ""can't live with the pain of it""."

"Plans could see an extra two million passengers fly from the airport a year. North Somerset Council planners have recommended approval of the scheme - despite the authority declaring a climate emergency a year ago. The council has received more than 8,000 comments on the plans. Those will ""all be considered"" by councillors on 10 February, a spokesman said. Natural England and the Environment Agency have warned 2020 will be ""the last chance"" to tackle climate change. Bristol band Massive Attack has previously highlighted environmental issues, saying they will only tour Europe using trains rather than planes. The band, whose songs include Unfinished Sympathy and Teardrop, tweeted that councillors should ""act now"" and reject the expansion to ""uphold"" their declaration of a climate emergency in July last year. They added: ""In the face of Climate Emergency does a city with a population of 460k really need to expand an airport that already provides capacity for 10 million flights?"" Bristol Airport said it had responded to the climate emergency declarations by bringing forward its plan to make it ""carbon neutral"" by 2025. It also plans an increased use of electric vehicles, a shift to renewable energy and increasing the cost of its drop-off parking as this is the ""least sustainable way"" to get to the airport. The scheme includes a multi-storey car park and expanded baggage handling areas but plans for a new terminal have been shelved. Neighbouring parish councils have said local roads would not cope with any increase at the airport. Campaigners also clashed with local councils after plans to expand to 12 million passengers was recommended for approval last month. Campaigner Liz Reese told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""You cannot endorse the expansion of the airport at the same time as really acknowledging and understanding that there is a climate emergency.""",Eco-campaigning band Massive Attack has called for Bristol Airport expansion plans to be rejected.
"Housing Secretary James Brokenshire told MPs that of the 210 households affected, 201 had accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation. Labour said only a third of families affected were in a permanent home. Meanwhile, the government announced it will fund a £400m operation to remove dangerous cladding from tower blocks. Only buildings owned by councils and housing associations will qualify. Mr Brokenshire told a Labour-led debate that of the 201 households which had accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation, 138 have moved into their accommodation. Of these 138, 64 are in temporary accommodation and 74 in permanent homes. Weeks after the fire on 14 June last year, which killed 71 people, the government said survivors would be offered permanent furnished social housing within 12 months. Mr Brokenshire acknowledged that progress had been ""too slow"" and that it was ""understandable"" that some in the community would feel ""let down"" but said the local council now had 300 properties available ""to those who need them"". 'The State failed' Shadow housing secretary John Healey said residents had spoken about being offered properties which were damp, with insufficient bedrooms or on tenancy terms which were different to those they had in Grenfell. ""No-one wants to bring up children in a hotel room,"" he said. During the debate, Labour former minister David Lammy paid tribute to family friend Khadija Saye, a 24-year-old artist who died in the fire. ""She died, frankly, because the state failed her,"" he said. ""The state told her to stay put and she stayed put and when she did leave, even though she got split up from her mother, she didn't quite make it out. ""Had she set about leaving earlier, she probably would be with us today."" Conservative backbencher Kwasi Kwarteng said the government will be judged on its response to the tragedy and warned that the Tory party was at risk of losing the good will of victims of the fire. He told the debate that there was an issue of a ""polarised society"". ""The suspicion today is that as the royal borough has got wealthier and wealthier, the political class, the people running the borough have really forgotten some of the less advantaged members of their community,"" he said. Announcing the funding for replacing cladding during Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May told MPs that fire and rescue services had visited more than 1,250 tower blocks around the country since the fire. Another resident - who suffered from long-term health issues prior to the disaster - was rescued from the fire but died in hospital in January. Cladding on 228 buildings failed safety tests after the disaster. On Thursday, Dame Judith Hackitt, the senior engineer responsible for reviewing the building regulations in the wake of the Grenfell fire, will publish her final report. ""As we approach the anniversary of the appalling tragedy that was the Grenfell Tower fire, our thoughts are with the victims and survivors and all those affected by that tragedy,"" added Mrs May. The prime minister said that while councils and housing associations ""must remove dangerous cladding quickly"", the new scheme should not undermine other ""important maintenance and repair work"". Privately-owned tower blocks will not be covered by government funding with residents in some buildings covered in the cladding initially being asked to cover the costs. Leaseholder residents in the Citiscape building in Croydon, south London, were asked to pay up to £31,300 each in order for the cladding to be replaced but the tower's developer, Barratt Developments, then said it would pay instead.","Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire will still be living in emergency accommodation 12 months after the tragedy, the government has confirmed."
"By Simon BrowningBusiness reporter, BBC News It turned down the requests from airlines because of concerns about queues at passport control. The airport told the BBC that it did not want to exacerbate existing pressures at the border by allowing more passengers to fly in. From 0400 on Friday many arrivals from India will be refused entry. British and Irish passport holders, and people with UK residence rights, will be allowed in, but must quarantine in hotels for 10 days. Last week, a director at the airport said the situation at the border - which is operated by the Home Office - had become ""untenable"" because of delays in processing arriving passengers. Eight flights Four carriers requested to operate an additional eight flights from India as travellers seek to fly before the enforced quarantine comes into effect. Currently, 30 flights a week are operating between the UK and India. The Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that it also received applications for charter flight permits from India to the UK - but these had been declined or withdrawn as they did not meet the qualifying criteria. A government spokesperson said: ""We are in a global health pandemic - people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary. ""Every essential check helps avoid the risk of importing dangerous variants of coronavirus which could put our vaccine rollout at risk."" On Monday the Department for Transport announced that India would be added to the government red list because of rising infection rates and a new variant. Since then, online travel agent Skyscanner said searches for flights returning to the UK from India had increased by more than 250%. When the new rules come into effect, anyone arriving in England or Scotland from India will need to stay in a government-sanctioned quarantine hotel for 10 days and follow a strict coronavirus testing regime at their own expense. There are currently no direct international flights from India into Wales or Northern Ireland. In England, a stay in one of the quarantine hotel costs £1,750 per passenger travelling alone. That includes transport, tests, food and accommodation. Every additional adult, or child over 12, must pay £650, while children aged five to 12 pay £325. A briefing document drawn up by officials at Public Health England shows that between 25 March and 7 April, 3,345 arrivals from India were registered in UK border travel data. Of those 161 - or 4.8% - tested positive for Covid-19 after a PCR test. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled a planned trip to India, which had been due to take place on 26 April.",Heathrow Airport has refused to allow extra flights from India before the country is added to the UK travel red list on Friday.
"Conservative Mervyn Loynes, of South Cambridgeshire District Council, made the comment about the Smithy Fen site to fellow councillors in February. The council has now published the remarks in a report. Mr Loynes, who had been told to complete equalities training, was unavailable for comment. A council spokesman said the incident had been ""mutually resolved"" after Mr Loynes agreed to the training. The BBC learned of Mr Loynes' remarks two weeks ago, but the council refused to confirm what he had said at the time. 'Tackle prejudice' The published report details an independent investigation carried out on behalf of the council by solicitor consultant Robert Swinfield. It considered a number of complaints about comments allegedly made in front of council officers prior to a meeting to discuss travellers' issues. Mr Swinfield agreed one comment had breached the council's code of conduct. ""I have concluded that councillor Loynes went on to say 'I'd put a minefield round all of them',"" said Mr Swinfield. ""By 'them', he meant the traveller community at Smithy Fen."" Mr Swinfield said the comment had breached various clauses of the code of conduct relating to ""respect, equalities and disrepute"". He added: ""In my view the comment made by councillor Loynes does cause the council to breach the equalities enactments, in failing to have due regard to the need to foster good relations, tackle prejudice and promote understanding between persons who are travellers and those who are not."" Following initial complaints, Mr Loynes had resigned from two planning committees, a move described by Conservative council leader Ray Manning as the ""honourable thing"" to do. The council's Civic Affairs Committee, which covers a number of areas including ethical standards, met on Monday to determine what information relating to the case would be made public.","A councillor breached equality laws when he suggested putting a minefield around a travellers' site in Cambridgeshire, a report has said."
"Independent councillor Terry Chivers said it was ""bad timing"" while the council was making redundancies. But deputy leader John Thomson said the independent reviewing panel could equally decide to reduce allowances. The basic allowance is £11,403, but most councillors get more by making additional claims. Leader Jane Scott received more than £47,000 last year. Earlier this week the council discussed a four-year business plan which projects budget cuts of £122m. Last week, the authority accepted 220 staff applications for voluntary redundancy as part of plans to cut 400 posts from the workforce. 'Wrong messages' Mr Chivers said: ""You cannot be cutting services, you cannot be sacking staff, and giving yourself a pay rise. ""It sends out all the wrong messages to our staff and to the public. ""I think all councillors work very, very hard, I'm not saying we don't deserve a rise. ""Being a councillor at the low rate of allowances we get does put an awful lot of people off being a councillor and it actually bars some people from being a councillor. ""I just don't think we can justify [a rise] at this present time."" Mr Thomson said: ""I believe it was last reviewed in 2009 because it was a new unitary council and we had gone down from 250 councillors to 98, which I think has led to nearly £3m of savings in members' expenses and allowances. ""We guessed some of the rates for people and it was felt that after four years, when it had all settled down, we needed to have an independent panel to make sure we were not paying people too much, that people were getting the right rates."" The results of the review will go before the council in November. Mr Thomson said: ""I will be voting against any increase at this stage, but there's 98 members and they can make the decision themselves. ""I think a lot of people who are councillors do it because they want to put something back into society, I don't think they do it for the money. ""The money is meant to make sure you're not out of pocket for the time you put in.""",A review of Wiltshire councillors' allowances has been criticised as it could result in an increase.
"A 17-year-old boy died after opening a parcel and a woman in her 40s was wounded in the explosion, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. A 75-year-old Hispanic woman was also hurt when a parcel exploded elsewhere in the city on Monday, he said. Police say they have yet to determine a motive in the three attacks. The two explosions on Monday came less than two weeks after a similar blast killed a 39-year-old black man at his home in the Texas capital. ""This is the third in what we believe to be related incidents over the past 10 days,"" Chief Manley said while speaking to reporters near the site of Monday's second explosion. Authorities are looking into whether race played a role as the victims in two of the cases were African American while the third blast injured a Hispanic woman. Mr Manley had earlier suggested that the attacks could have been hate crimes, but later said police have yet to establish a motive. ""We are not ruling anything out at this point,"" he said. ""We are willing to investigate any avenue that may be involved."" Investigators said at the time they believed that the explosion in north-east Austin on 2 March was an isolated incident. But on Monday Austin police said they suspect the earlier fatality, initially treated as a suspicious death, was linked to Monday's death. Both are now being investigated as homicides. Monday's first blast happened at 06:44 local time (11:44 GMT) on Monday. The Austin police bomb squad, the Austin Fire Department, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and postal inspectors responded to the scene. Mr Manley told reporters: ""Early this morning one of the residents went out front and there was a package on the front door step. ""They brought that package inside the residence and as they opened that package both victims were in the kitchen and the package exploded causing the injuries that resulted in the young man's death and the injuries to the adult female."" The house sustained significant damage, according to Chief Manley. Authorities were called to another residence where a separate explosion injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman. She was taken to hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries. He said investigators had determined in all three cases the parcels did not go through the US Postal Service, meaning they had probably been hand delivered. Chief Manley said the bombs were in an ""average-size letter box"" and ""not particularly large"". The police chief advised the public to be wary of un-franked and unexpected packages.","Two parcel bombs that left a teenager dead and two others injured in Austin, Texas are believed to be linked to a case earlier this month, police say."
"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter at the Eurovision Song Contest The 25-year-old singer from County Clare failed to impress with her retro pop tune 22, becoming one of eight acts to be sent packing. In contrast, contest favourites Russia, Sweden and the Netherlands progressed to the final with ease. Azerbaijani representative Chingiz also went through, with a little help from two laser-pointing robot arms. Thursday's second Eurovision semi-final followed official confirmation that Madonna will perform during Saturday's final in Israel. McTernan gave a confident performance against a backdrop of colourful comic book imagery inspired by US artist Roy Lichtenstein. Yet the singer, who has spoken openly about her struggles with post-natal depression, still did not make the final - unlike Ryan O'Shaughnessy, her country's 2018 representative. Australia's Kate Miller-Heidke, who qualified for the final on Tuesday, has also spoken candidly about her battles with the condition. Ireland has won Eurovision more times than any other country - seven in all - but has not notched up a victory since 1996. Other acts left disappointed included Croatian singer Roko Blazevic, who wore a pair of golden angel's wings during his performance. This was despite his dramatic number The Dream being written by Jacques Houdek, Croatia's representative in 2017, and Charlie Mason, co-writer of Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix. There was little love for this year's Austrian entry, a wispy, whispery ballad performed by a blue-haired singer dubbed Paenda - real name Gabriela Horn. And having acclaimed Ukrainian sand artist Kseniya Simonova create an artwork during her performance did not help Anna Odobescu from Moldova. But there was better luck for Danish singer Leonora, who performed her song Love is Forever perched on a giant blue chair. North Macedonia also went forward, just a few months on from its new name being approved by the international community. Albania, Norway and Switzerland also advanced thanks to a combination of jury and public votes. Maltese teenager Michela, meanwhile, was left crying tears of joy when the final spot available in the final went in her direction. Other Eurovision stories The 10 qualifying acts will join Miller-Heidke and nine others that went through on Tuesday in Saturday's final. The line-up will be completed by the ""big five"" nations who bypass the semi-final stage - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom - and host nation Israel. Thursday's show, broadcast live in the UK on BBC Four, featured a performance from The Shalva Band, a group of eight musicians who all have disabilities. The band were favourites to represent host country Israel but pulled out when the dress rehearsal was scheduled for Friday - the Jewish holy day of rest. Their performance of A Million Dreams, from hit musical Greatest Showman, was warmly received by the audience in Tel Aviv's International Convention Center. The semi-final also featured a trick from ""world-famous mentalist"" Lior Suchard, who appeared to correctly predict a series of numbers apparently chosen at random by four of this year's hopefuls.

"Local authorities find out in December what their settlement is for 2013/14. The leaders of Southampton, Portsmouth and Brighton and Hove City Councils have said it is too late. They claim they are unable to budget properly, leading to ill-informed decisions and pressure on finances. 'Rushed decisions' Green councillor Jason Kitcat, Leader of Brighton and Hove council, Liberal Democrat councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth council, and Labour councillor Richard Williams, leader of Southampton council, have written jointly to Mr Pickles. Mr Williams said: ""We acknowledge central government's approach to reduce public spending, but we need some degree of certainty about the level of reduction to be able to plan properly. ""The difference between cuts of 0.8% and of 12% or more is millions of pounds for our councils. ""To leave telling councils how much money they will receive so late in the budget process can only lead to rushed decisions."" 'Trust the public' The council leaders have also questioned the government's move to make local authorities call a referendum if they want to raise council tax by more than 2%. Mr Kitcat said: ""Government must trust us to make the right decisions for our cities. In some cases this might mean modest increases to council tax, often preferable to reducing or stopping services as we work to deliver radical new models of public services."" Communities Minister Brandon Lewis said councils should trust in the public. He said: ""They need to go out to their population and to their residents and say 'Look, we want more money from you, we want to charge you a higher rate of tax - are you happy with that'? ""If those councils feel they have a good case to put they should go to the public, ask the public and trust the public are happy to pay that money for the service they provide.""",Three council leaders have written to Communities Secretary Eric Pickles urging him to speed up the process of telling councils how much money they will receive from the government.
"By Kev GeogheganEntertainment reporter, BBC News Of all the credits attached to the name Bruce Lee, one of the bolder claims made in the documentary I Am Bruce Lee, is that he was the de facto father of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). Often criticised for its brutality, MMA, and its most popular form the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), has overtaken boxing as the most watched full-contact sport in the world. Its invention is credited largely to the Gracie family of fighters from Brazil, who founded the Brazilian jiu-jitsu utilised in ""anything goes"" combat of the early 20th Century. However, Bruce Lee's daughter Shannon Lee agrees it is unlikely that one man or family single-handedly invented something as universal as mixing different forms of combat. ""Certainly, there are very few wholly original ideas in the world, there are usually people coming to the same conclusions or carrying out experiments, whether publicly or privately."" But she adds: ""One thing I will say about my father is that he was very much out in the forefront talking about his beliefs about being a complete fighter and attaching a philosophy to that and teaching it. ""While there may have been people prior to him who thought about mixing one or two forms, it was really my father who took it to a public level."" If Lee was responsible for mixing fighting styles together, he also married the physical and the philosophical, thanks to his studies at the University of Washington as a young man. ""You know how I think of myself?"", he said once in an interview. ""As a human being.... under the sky, under the heavens there is but one family."" Next year marks the 40th anniversary of his death, from a cerebral oedema, a fatal build up of fluid on the brain. He was just 32 and the father of two young children with his wife Linda Lee Cadwell. It is also the 40th anniversary of his most famous film, Enter The Dragon, released months after his death, bringing him international, albeit posthumous, acclaim. In fact, his tragically short career has prompted other documentary makers though the years to examine his life, begging the question of whether there is any need for another one. ""There have been many documentaries,"" admits Shannon Lee, who acted as executive producer of I Am Bruce Lee. ""In fact, when the idea of this documentary came about, even I was a little wary. ""What's so great is that my father is extremely present in this film, it's not just people talking about him. You get a sense that he's there and he's offering the viewer an opinion on himself."" I Am Bruce Lee also omits more obvious talking heads, such as fellow martial arts stars like Jackie Chan and Jet li, in favour of aficionados such as Modern Family actor Ed O'Neill, basketball player Kobe Bryant and Black Eyed Peas star Taboo. Lee's friend and student Dan Inosanto also speaks movingly about him. The pair fought against each other in Game of Death, a film only half completed by Lee before his death. Much of what is known of Lee's life and philosophy comes from a 1971 interview with Pierre Berton, probably now the definitive interview with the late superstar, certainly the only surviving television interview, done just two years prior to his death. Clips from the interview feature extensively in I Am Bruce Lee, as he explains his beliefs to an increasingly bemused presenter. ""He was being himself to such a high degree,"" says Shannon. ""In fact sometimes Pierre is looking at him as if to say, 'What is this guy talking about?'. But I do think it's a special piece of film."" Initially an actress who made her film debut in Dragon, the 1993 biopic of her father, Shannon Lee is now president of the Bruce Lee Foundation , a non-profit organisation aimed at protecting the star's legacy and offering educational scholarships to ""students who... exemplify Bruce Lee's passion for education"". Four decades after his death, his name is still a business worth up to $5m a year. However, the figure is small fry in comparison with the estates of other top earning dead celebrities. The problem, Lee says, is that her father is still one of the most iconic film stars of the 20th Century and it is a daily battle tackling the illegal use of his image and piracy of his films. ""We'll spend a week getting everything taken down and two weeks later, all new stuff is up,"" she says. ""We have a little running joke in the office, which is 'don't go on the internet'."" Joking aside, avoiding the internet is not necessarily a bad thing if Lee wishes to avoid long-running speculation about remaking Bruce Lee's most famous film. ""I don't think Enter The Dragon should ever be remade,"" she says flatly. ""I don't think that anyone could try to be my father, I think he was extremely unique and if anybody were to try to act like him and pull off the action in the same way, that would be a mistake. ""Trying to give a Bruce Lee-esque performance would be an epic failure."" With talk of releasing a remastered version of the film for its anniversary next year, perhaps it is a failure that can be avoided for now. I Am Bruce Lee is on limited release on 20 July and is out on DVD and Blu-ray on 23 July.","Almost 40 years after his death, a documentary on the life of martial arts legend Bruce Lee is being released, showing him as a film star, fighter and philosopher, and produced by his daughter Shannon Lee."

He loved to play with toy cars and Thomas the Tank Engine, and was always accompanied by Woody and friends from Toy Story, his family said. ""His cuddles made us feel loved and special, and made our hearts melt. He was always asking for Nanny's chocolate pennies and if you gave him one he would ask for two, and then three, in his cheeky, cute, sweet way,"" they added. The fire broke out at about 01:20 BST on Tuesday, but the property was unstable, and it was not until Wednesday the pair were recovered. A post-mortem examination on Friday revealed they died of smoke inhalation. Sussex Police continues to appeal for witnesses. No arrests have yet been made.","The family of a ""free-spirited"" woman, and her ""cheeky"" son have paid tribute after the pair died in a house fire."
"The provisional figures were released on Tuesday by the PSNI. The 2010 total was the lowest since records began in 1931. Environment Minister Alex Attwood said that one death was too many and that more remained to be done to educate road users, prosecute offenders, impose the right penalties and reduce risk. He urged people across Northern Ireland to take more care while driving. ""I am committed to ensuring that everything possible is done to prevent further deaths and serious injuries during 2012,"" he said. ""I continue to urge road users to pay attention, expect the unexpected, slow down, always wear your seatbelt and never drive having consumed drink or drugs."" The minister also revealed that in the last five years, pedestrians accounted for 18% of deaths and serious injuries on the roads, compared to 62% for car drivers and passengers. Preventable While there have been significantly fewer road deaths over the past two years, PSNI assistant chief constable Alistair Finlay warned against complacency. ""The stark reality is that the majority of road traffic collisions are preventable,"" he said. ""Excessive speed for the conditions is still the most common single cause of fatal and serious injuries on roads in Northern Ireland, followed by the consumption of alcohol or drugs by drivers or riders and inattention or diverted attention."" In all, 14,522 people have been killed on the roads in NI since records began in 1931.","Fifty-nine people were killed on Northern Ireland's roads in 2011, compared to fifty-five in 2010."
"The new system has been placed on four buildings in Aberystwyth following complaints from people that nuisance gulls had ""aggressively"" taken food. But it will not be turned on until September because it is feared parents might desert fledgling birds. It is also being used to stop gulls from nesting on roofs on campus. The so-called bio-acoustic deterrent system broadcasts a gull's distress call, which is designed to scare the birds. A university spokesman said: ""The aim is to discourage seagulls from nesting on buildings in this area so that they will then be discouraged from foraging for food to feed their young in the area. ""The work has been undertaken following a number of reports received by the university of seagulls aggressively taking food from people in the vicinity of the arts centre piazza and also in order to gain safe access to roofs for essential maintenance of equipment. ""It is planned to switch the units on in September 2010 to provide a permanent deterrent to gulls nesting on the roofs of buildings."" Jim Hughes works at the univesity's arts centre piazza cafe and has witnessed numerous attacks on customers, and has been a victim. He said the seagulls were cunning. He added: ""Attacks can happen a few times a day. The gulls prey on people, stalk and linger around. They can even stand at one end of a table while people are sitting eating at the other end. ""They started by working in pairs. One diverted a person's attention while the other stole the food, but they now attack on their own."" Mr Hughes said he had been a victim as well. ""I was carrying some food and a gull swooped down. I dropped some of the food, but managed to save the rest. ""Last week the same thing happened again, but I managed to avoid the seagull and save the food.""",Speakers mimicking the sound of distressed seagulls have been installed at a university to prevent hungry gulls from bothering diners near a cafe.
"By Niall GlynnBBC News NI The idea for the Silver Santa campaign was sparked by the loss of her 92-year-old mother from Covid-19. Its success means that rather than a one-off, gifts will be delivered for many years to come. ""I'm completely and utterly overwhelmed by people's generosity - it blew me away,"" Ms Houston told BBC News NI. An original Facebook appeal for presents, worth £10, for 120 elderly people has been transformed into gifts for almost 900 people, many of whom would otherwise not have received anything this Christmas. As well as those living alone in the community, more than 40 care homes and agencies for the elderly are involved in the scheme. Due to coronavirus restrictions, loneliness has intensified for many elderly people. ""With the current circumstances it will mean absolutely everything to them,"" said Hannah McVeigh, of Phoenix Clinic in Newtownards. ""They definitely do get forgotten about, especially the ones who don't have family, because everyone else is thinking about their own family, they don't think about the ones who have no-one. ""So it's really nice for them to be thought about. ""It's been really difficult for them, because it's been [Covid-19] testing every week, they don't get to go out on their day trips, they can't go on their shopping trips, they can't go out with family on their trips, so the home is all they know. ""So it would even brighten up the staff's days just to see them smile, even for that one time of the year that someone's actually thought about them, other than us that look after them day in day out."" Michelle Twist, manager of Towell House in east Belfast, said that the gifts ""will definitely raise morale"". ""Our residents are coping very well at the moment,"" she said. ""We do have a lot of activities in house and try to keep them as entertained as possible, but I think that they would appreciate that they're being thought of. ""They're not just a number, they mean something to somebody."" 'People have been extremely generous' It is not just the number of presents that has astounded Heather Houston, but the thought that went into each one. ""It's not just as if people have gone out and bought a wee present,"" she said. ""People have been extremely generous, spending much more than £10, decorating boxes with pine cones and ribbons. ""Some of the gifts are just absolutely beautiful and really personalised to the person. ""One gentleman loved wildlife, so the person got him a DVD and a book and slippers and sweets - it was just a goodie bag packed with everything. ""Another man, who had served in the war, somebody had bought him books and things about Northern Ireland and Belfast and, because he was hard of hearing, had gone to the trouble of getting him an audiobook made. ""So people have really gone above and beyond, it's not just a wee present thrown together."" She said that as well as presents, people have also included messages to the recipients. Local businesses have got involved too, as well as a lot of young people. ""We've had teenagers come to the door and a six-year-old boy gave a present,"" she said. ""He had made his card, he had gone with his mum and bought the present."" ""One teenager was just very emotional, because he had lost his grandmother and just felt 'this year I'm not going to be able to buy the present for her', so it connected with him in the same way it connected with me. ""Right through them to elderly people coming and saying 'I'm fine, I've got family, but I want to give something to somebody who hasn't', so it's really spanned every age."" 'They just love kids' Michelle McMillen, manager of Comber Care Home, said that for young people to take the time to give gifts to elderly residents would make Christmas even more special. ""It's absolutely fantastic, it really is, because I think sometimes nursing homes get forgotten a wee bit,"" she said. ""We did discuss it and said that we're going to participate in it and they [the residents] were really, really excited and when we said they might get a gift from children - they just love kids."" Heather said the response to her appeal had been a fitting tribute to her mum. ""For me, as it comes closer to Christmas, I'm thinking more about my mum,"" she said. ""So the thought of 900 elderly people being able to open something on Christmas Day is lovely, just very special. ""My brain's already going with how I can roll this out to make this even more straightforward next year,"" she said. ""Silver Santa will be back in 2021 and my mum's memory and legacy will live on each year in making our elderly feel special at Christmas time.""",When County Down woman Heather Houston launched a campaign to help bring Christmas to lonely elderly people she did not dream how it would take off.
"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent Shakespeare's grave in Holy Trinity Church in Stratford upon Avon has never been excavated, but a scan has been carried out to search below ground. This allows an investigation without physically disturbing the site. The findings are expected to be revealed in the next few weeks. There are believed to have been discoveries in the grave, in a church where five members of the Shakespeare family are buried. There has been speculation about a possible family vault under the stones - and questions about whether such a ground-penetrating scan would show other items buried with Shakespeare. The grave, where the playwright was buried in 1616, carries the warning: ""Good friend, for Jesus' sake forebeare, To digg the dust enclosed heare; Bleste be the man that spares thes stones, And curst be he that moves my bones."" The investigation into the grave was revealed ahead of this summer's World Shakespeare Congress. The congress, likened to an Olympics for Shakespearean scholarship, is held every five years. This year's event will be split between Stratford upon Avon and London. Michael Dobson, professor of Shakespeare studies at the University of Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute, said previous anniversaries had been ""dogged"" by rivalries between the playwrights's birthplace and workplace. The World Shakespeare Congress, beginning in July, will bring together a thousand Shakespearean specialists, researchers and academics. Plans for the congress were presented at Shakespeare's Globe, one of the venues, in an event co-hosted with groups including the Royal Shakespeare Company, the University of Birmingham, King's College London and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. As well as a range of performances, debates, seminars and conferences at the congress, this anniversary year will see new findings from research and archaeology. There will also be findings from investigations in Shakespeare's last home, New Place in Stratford. The house, due to be reopened to the public in July, has been excavated in a dig commissioned by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Paul Edmondson, the trust's head of research, says the excavation has uncovered a much clearer picture of Shakespeare's home life, and there will be findings about his cold store - the equivalent of a 17th Century fridge - and the family's oven. He says it gives a stronger impression of someone who spent much more of his life in Stratford than might once have been claimed - and Dr Edmondson suggests that if the playwright's commercial life was in London, his place for writing might have been his home in Stratford. Dr Edmondson says the fascination with Shakespeare's life shows no sign of fading and for researchers ""his life will never be complete"". There are also excavations this year in London, which would reveal more about Elizabethan theatre, said Gordon McMullan, director of the London Shakespeare Centre, King's College London. In the spring, Museum of London Archaeology will carry out the biggest dig so far on the site of the Curtain theatre in Shoreditch. Until now there have only been exploratory excavations, and this dig could reveal how much of the theatre, where Shakespeare's plays were performed, has survived. Farah Karim-Cooper, head of higher education and research at Shakespeare's Globe, said it could have been where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. Prof McMullan said the forthcoming anniversary would emphasise the idea of Shakespeare as a global figure - while a century ago, there were still strong associations of Shakespeare as a national poet. Peter Holbrook, chairman of the International Shakespeare Association, welcomed the idea of staging the congress in both Stratford and London. ""It is entirely fitting then, in this quatercentenary year, to bring Shakespeare home,"" he said.",A radar survey into William Shakespeare's grave and an excavation of the playwright's house are among research projects marking the 400th anniversary of his death.
"By Jennifer ScottBBC News Conservatives Antoinette Sandbach and Will Quince will host a Twitter session on Monday as ""Baby Loss Awareness Week"" gets under way. The pair have also arranged a debate in the House of Commons on Thursday. They hope talking about the issue will help stop other parents from ""suffering in silence"". Mr Quince, MP for Colchester, and his wife Elinor had a stillborn son named Robert in October 2014 and will be marking two years since his death on Wednesday. ""We found out something was wrong at our 20-week scan and that he had an incredibly rare condition called Edwards' Syndrome,"" he told the BBC. ""Some babies who have it live for a few weeks, others live for a few years, and some are stillborn. ""We had two options. Continue with the pregnancy or terminate - which is an awful word and would have meant an injection through the mother and into the baby's heart. It was not a hard choice for us, we decided to continue, even though the most likely outcome was a stillbirth."" Robert made it all the way to 40 weeks but died in the last few minutes of labour, which was heartbreaking for the family. ""It is a traumatic thing to go through,"" said Mr Quince. ""For a woman to give birth to a lifeless baby and for the father who watches it happen, it is a horrific ordeal."" He co-chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Baby Loss with Eddisbury MP Ms Sandbach, who lost her son Sam five days after he was born in 2009. She thanked the public for their support last year after she spoke about her experience in Parliament and broke down into tears. ""The night my son died, I awoke to find him not breathing,"" she said. ""Arriving at hospital, looking at a flat line in the ambulance for over 20 minutes, a crash team was waiting for me, but it was too late. ""Staff at the hospital were wonderful but I found myself in a plain room with questions being asked at me."" It was leaflets handed to her at the hospital with numbers for a local charity, the Chrysalis Trust, that helped her through. ""This week and the debate in Parliament is hugely important,"" said Ms Sandbach. ""It can often be very isolating, as family and friends don't know what to say. We need to talk about the issues."" Both MPs now want more help for families who go through a stillbirth or neonatal death, and for the public to talk about it in the hope of stopping those deaths that are avoidable, as well as bringing more comfort to the bereaved. ""The sad case is around half of stillbirths are preventable,"" said Mr Quince. ""That is 2,000 babies a year. That is 2,000 families who don't have to go through this. And we have one of the best healthcare systems in the world. ""The government has pledged to cut the number of these preventable deaths by 2020 and halve it by 2030 and are putting the money in to help. But there is the issue that care isn't consistent across NHS trusts."" Key statistics on stillbirth and neonatal deaths 'Wave of Light' The organisers of the campaign have urged the public to get involved on Saturday by lighting a candle at 19:00 BST for an hour to remember all the babies who have died, calling it a ""Wave of Light"". Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive of Sands, said: ""Baby Loss Awareness Week is chance for bereaved families to unite in remembering their precious babies which we hope will help them feel less isolated and alone. ""It's fundamental that we raise awareness of the issues surrounding baby loss and infant death and push for changes in practice across the UK. ""The support of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Baby Loss and their commitment to both raising these issues and helping to change policy is invaluable.""",Two MPs who know the pain and trauma of losing a baby are calling for more support for people affected by stillbirth or neonatal death.
"Sales edged up from 3,538 cars in 2011 to 3,575 in 2012. But the 1% growth was much lower than the 31% and 150% growth rates seen in the last two years. The company said it had expanded into new markets, including Latin America. The luxury marque said it had faced a number of challenges in 2012 including global business uncertainty and political unrest. In addition it is preparing for the start of production of the Phantom Series II and has begun expansion works at its Goodwood site in West Sussex. Rolls-Royce's portfolio includes the Phantom family of cars and the Ghost model. Sales grew by 26% in the Middle East, by 21% in mainland Europe and by 18% in Asia-Pacific. The company said that the majority of cars - 95% of Phantoms and 73% of Ghosts - were sold with some element of bespoke personalisation. ""We had an outstanding year in spite of the challenges we faced, and Rolls-Royce now leads the ultra luxury market by some considerable margin,"" said chief executive Torsten Muller-Otvos.","Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which is owned by BMW, has reported record car sales for the third year in a row."
"By Andy DangerfieldBBC News, London ""This year is the beginning of the run-up to 2012,"" says Notting Hill Carnival Ltd director Chris Boothman. ""My vision for 2012 is to make it really spectacular."" 2012's carnival will fall between the Olympic and Paralympic Games and Mr Boothman believes ""all eyes of the world will be on London"". ""We can't afford to have any sub-standard participation,"" he said. ""Although we have some of the best at Notting Hill, some stuff doesn't deserve that kind of stage,"" Mr Boothman explained. This year, carnival organisers will be observing the floats to decide which performers have what it takes. ""We'll be auditing what's out there with a view to making tough decisions over which bands will be part of 2012's parade,"" Mr Boothman said. ""There's a music policy and there are rules about starting times and costumes."" 'Spectacular event' But he said ""some in the carnival community think we are changing its nature"". Clary Salandy, a designer and director at Mahogany mas camp (a mas band is a costume band) says there is ""a conflict between people who just want to have fun and people who want to create a spectacular event"". ""Some people stick a few feathers on a band and say they've made a costume,"" she said. But she said she ""would not like to see smaller groups penalised if they were not properly resourced"". Mr Boothman agrees that resources are an issue. ""Cuts have definitely affected the carnival,"" he said. The Panorama steel band competition is a recent a victim of cuts as the Greater London Authority reduced its funding from £150,000 to £30,000 this year. The event has had to be moved from Hyde Park to a smaller venue. ""Frankly, we can live with it this year,"" says Mr Boothman. ""But we'd like to get back into Hyde Park for 2012."" Sponsorship has also been affected by budgetary belt-tightening. ""Two major sponsors fell by the wayside,"" said Mr Boothman. But he said ""it's difficult to bang a drum about being hard done by when everyone is having to make tough decisions"". Carnival organisers are already making plans for alternative ways to raise money for 2012. Fringe events Notting Hill Carnival Ltd has appointed an advisory board made up of young professionals including an entertainment lawyer and a marketing expert. ""We need to turn around the carnival's image so we attract big brands,"" says Samenua Sesher, head of culture at Kensington and Chelsea council. ""Carnival has people of all races, classes and backgrounds,"" she said. ""It's the poster child for multicultural London."" Planning is also under way to transform the carnival into a longer-running event. ""We'd like to follow a model like the Edinburgh festival, to create a carnival season,"" said Mr Boothman. ""We would put on fringe events that people would pay to see."" But a bigger carnival could create capacity issues for the area of west London. ""We expect more people to come, which will put the area under strain,"" said Mr Boothman. The Notting Hill Carnival Ltd and Kensington and Chelsea Council agree the route ""will have to be reconsidered"" for 2012. But there could be big changes before then. ""We'll need to rehearse any significant changes in 2011,"" said Ms Sesher. And the intrinsic link between the Olympics and carnival looks set to continue beyond London 2012. With the Olympic flame being passed to Rio de Janeiro for 2016, the Brazilians are likely to show they also know a thing or two about carnival.","As the sequins shimmer, feathers flutter and steel drums rumble at this weekend's Notting Hill Carnival, organisers will be thinking ""you ain't seen nothing yet""."
"From Tuesday, indoor swimming pools and sports facilities can reopen but residents remain banned from meeting other households in homes and gardens. Some locals said the changes had not gone far enough and businesses had been prioritised over ""ordinary people"". The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said ""decisions are based on data and methods of infections"". ""You can go to the hairdressers, a pub, a restaurant, a church, a mosque - but I can't see my daughter in my own garden,"" said Sandra Holyoake, 64, from the Hamilton area, on the north west of the city. ""I can completely live with the restrictions and the lockdown but I can't understand the logic."" Tessa Warrington, from Westcotes, closer to the city centre, said the decisions made felt ""quite hypocritical"". ""People are going indoors and mixing in shopping centres, bars and pubs, and I understand that desire for social interaction, but why can't I do the same and go round my mates?"" asked the 32-year-old. ""It feels like it's one rule for businesses and another rule for ordinary people."" And Pam Atter, 66, said: ""You can wander around the town and go shopping but you can't mix with your family.

"Lord Carey was criticised in an independent review of the church's handling of abuse carried out by Bishop Peter Ball, 85, who was jailed in 2015. Dame Moira Gibb's review revealed he had failed to pass information on Ball to the police back in 1992. Justin Welby, current Archbishop of Canterbury, asked for his resignation. Lord Carey had been given a role as an honorary assistant bishop in the diocese of Oxford, a position given to many retired bishops. 'Accepted criticisms' Ball, former bishop of Lewes and Gloucester, was jailed for two years and eight months in October 2015, after admitting sex offences against 18 teenagers and young men between the 1970s and 1990s. The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft, said: ""I have met with Lord Carey following the Archbishop's letter to him. ""In light of Dame Moira Gibb's review into the Peter Ball case, Lord Carey has resigned from his role as honorary Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Oxford. ""Lord Carey has accepted the criticisms made of him in the Gibb review and has apologised to the victims of Peter Ball."" Dame Moira Gibb's review revealed Lord Carey received various letters from families and individuals following the arrest and cautioning of Ball in 1992 for gross indecency, but failed to pass six of them to the police. He also chose not to put Ball on the Church of England's ""Lambeth List"", which names clergymen about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised. Ball was released from jail in February after serving 16 months. 'Focus on survivors' Dame Moira, a former senior social worker, said there was a failure of the Church to respond appropriately to misconduct over a period of many years. Rt Rev Steven Croft added: ""Along with many others, I have been deeply distressed to read Dame Moira Gibb's report with its narrative of the abuse perpetrated by Peter Ball which remained hidden for so long. ""I hope that the focus of attention will continue to be on the survivors of abuse and offering to them the care and support they need. ""As the Diocese of Oxford we are committed to improving continually the quality of safeguarding and care."" He said the diocese would learn lessons from the review and put its ""recommendations into practice"".",The former Archbishop of Canterbury has resigned from his last formal role in the church after a review into historical child sex abuse.
"Charlotte Cole took the ""hard decision"" to move George to her parents, who live five minutes away, after Covid-19 was confirmed at one of her workplaces. The 30-year-old and her husband have been making daily trips to see the toddler through a window ever since. She said she wanted ""to give him a cuddle"" but thought it too risky. ""It was such a hard decision to isolate from George but I was coming into contact with people with coronavirus on a daily basis,"" said Ms Cole, who works as a care nurse for a company which serves nursing homes around the North West. She said she also wanted to protect her mum Bridget, 55, and dad Robert, 65, who usually look after the toddler while she and Daniel, who works as a data analyst, are at work. ""Because of my work I am a continuing risk,"" she said. ""I decided I would rather they stayed in a bubble than put them all at risk,"" she said. At first the couple, both 30, from Kirkham, Lancashire, thought the lockdown would last just a few weeks but as the lockdown extended Ms Cole said being away from George had become more difficult. ""The house just feels so empty,"" she said. ""We have videos calls everyday and my mum and dad send me lots of pictures of him having breakfast and playing which is lovely, but it's the simple things I miss like not being able to read him a bedtime story, bath time even making him his lunch.""

Mohammed Abdulkadir Osman, 19, from London, originally pleaded not guilty but earlier admitted killing him at a court in Larnaca. Charges against two other teenagers, who were both 17 at the time of the stabbing, have been dropped. Mr Collins' mother Lisa Minott said: ""I'm just glad it's all over really. I just miss Steve, I'm just overwhelmed."" Knife crime campaign Fusilier Collins was off-duty with three other soldiers when they became involved in a brawl with three British holidaymakers outside Black & White club in the early hours of the morning of 4 November. It was the day before he was due to fly out to Afghanistan. He served with 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and was stationed at Dhekelia, about 12 miles (20km) west of Ayia Napa. Osman said in court in November he had acted in self-defence after a fight with Private Collins. He will be sentenced on 15 May. Family and friends of Fusilier Collins have launched a campaign against knife crime in the area.

"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter Some students are waiting 30 days for checks on the documents and biometric information they need, according to Universities UK. The problems started when outsourcing company Sopra Steria took over the service in November, says UUK. Sopra Steria has rejected suggestions its charges are excessive. UUK, which represents all 136 UK universities, says it is concerned that if Sopra Steria is struggling now, it will be completely overwhelmed by the more than 40,000 overseas students arriving ahead of the autumn term. Until last November, students were able to arrange document checks through their local post offices. Now, universities say applicants too often face: Elisa Calcagni, who is studying for a doctorate at Cambridge and comes from Chile, said she struggled for weeks to get an appointment and eventually decided to pay for a ""fast-track"" appointment in Croydon, two hours away. ""Despite booking a timed appointment, there was a waiting time of an hour and then the system wasn't working properly leading to further delays,"" she says. In addition, the website is not geared up for use by students with visual impairments, says UUK. Southampton student Khalid Elkhereiji found the website would not allow him to log on as it was incompatible with his screen reader. ""This is not a problem I face with other websites."" When he finally logged on with the help of a sighted person, he found no appointments available in Southampton and the university had to intervene. 'Broken system' Complaints have resulted in Sopra Steria offering pop-up services on some campuses but these 15-minute appointments cost £50, payable by the student or university. This does not account for the space and extra staff that universities will need to provide to allow these appointments to go ahead, says UUK. Earlier this month, Cardiff University said the pop-up service there would cost them £200,000, though Sopra Steria says the real amount is far lower. UUK chief executive Alistair Jarvis urged the company to mend its ""broken system"" before the September surge. ""International students make a huge cultural and economic contribution to the UK. Sopra Steria should be helping to send a more welcoming message to international students, signalling that the UK is open to talented individuals from around the world, as is the case at our universities,"" said Mr Jarvis. Sopra Steria said it is working closely with the Home Office, universities and higher education institutions across the UK to ""increase capacity where needed"". The Home Office said six new locations were opened in May and June across the UK to ensure extra document checking appointments were available.","International students are ""paying through the nose for a woefully inadequate document-checking service"" for UK study visas, say universities."
"But a complaint about a leaflet available to download from Healing on the Streets (Hots) Bath's website has been upheld. The leaflet said: ""Need Healing? God can heal today!"" The ASA originally ruled against the claim, but has now decided the website falls outside its jurisdiction. Hots Bath said the amended ruling was ""great news"" and ""sets a clear precedent for Christian websites"". 'False hope' The ASA said the leaflet read: ""Need Healing? God can heal today! Do you suffer from Back Pain, Arthritis, MS, Addiction ... Ulcers, Depression, Allergies, Fibromyalgia, Asthma, Paralysis, Crippling Disease, Phobias, Sleeping disorders or any other sickness? ""We'd love to pray for your healing right now! ""We're Christian from churches in Bath and we pray in the name of Jesus. ""We believe that God loves you and can heal you from any sickness."" The ASA originally said in February that the group could not make the claim in leaflets or on its website. But in the new adjudication , which follows an independent review, it says the Hots Bath website is outside its jurisdiction. 'Express our beliefs' The ASA said: ""We acknowledged that Hots volunteers believed that prayer could treat illness and medical conditions, and that therefore the ads did not promote false hope. ""However we noted we had not seen evidence that people had been healed through the prayer of Hots volunteers, and concluded that the ad could encourage false hope in those suffering from the named conditions and therefore were irresponsible.""

"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter, Vancouver Carbon3D said its ""game-changing"" process could make objects such as car parts, medical devices or shoes. The technique was inspired by the film Terminator 2, in which the T-1000 robot rises from a pool of metallic liquid. One independent expert told the BBC the technology showed huge potential, if the company's assertions stood up. ""It's not unusual for huge claims like this to be made,"" said James Woodcock, group editor for TCT Magazine. ""But as it's renowned experts working on it, it gives it some gravitas."" Mushroom growing On the Ted stage, the Carbon3D machine produced a plastic ball from a pool of resin in 10 minutes. ""It would traditionally take up to 10 hours to print this,"" Carbon3D chief executive Prof Joseph DeSimone told the audience. He said that current 3D printing methods had some fundamental flaws. ""First up, the name is a misnomer. It is really 2D printing over and over again,"" he said. The process is also often very slow. ""There are mushrooms that grow faster than some 3D-printed parts,"" he joked. And finally the objects created by traditional 3D printing are often mechanically weak because they are made up of multiple layers. His method is 25 to 100 times faster and can print solid final parts. It can, he said, potentially be up to 1,000 times faster. It works by applying different levels of light and oxygen to a pool of resin. Light hardens the resin, while oxygen stops hardening. By intricately controlling levels of each, the resin can be forced into complex shapes. In the field Possible uses for objects include medical stents that could be made-to-measure in medical rooms and teeth printed ""while the patient sits in the dentist's chair"", he said. Currently the printer can only work with polymer-based materials but Prof DeSimone told the BBC his firm is ""working on"" materials beyond that. There are already several printers being tested in the field - by an unnamed automotive firm, an athletic apparel company and a research lab. Carbon3D hopes to have its product out commercially ""within a year"". Mr Woodcock from TCT Magazine said the demonstration showed the need for companies in the industry to continually work on new technology. ""The whole 3D printing industry is on a knife edge - there' so much still to come. Even the biggest and most established companies are only a couple of announcements away from being redundant.""","A 3D printing process that harnesses light and oxygen has been demonstrated at the Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver."
"The former Wolverhampton Wanderers owner, businessman and philanthropist died on 13 January, aged 91. A boyhood fan, he bought the club in 1990, spending some £70m of his own money before selling up in 2007. His funeral included a helicopter flypast and a big screen in Queen Square broadcast the service. 'Celebration of life' At the Molineux ground, fans left floral tributes and banners at the Billy Wright statue. Wolves legend Steve Bull was among players present to pay tribute. A room in the Stan Cullis stand was opened for fans to pay their respects, with a book of condolence and a display of photographs. Fan Daniel Wilkes, 20 from Wolverhampton, said: ""I've never met Sir Jack, but he's done so much for the club and the city - he's made it what it is."" Roger Newton, from Wolverhampton, said Sir Jack was a, ""great Wulfrunian"". ""Wolverhampton hasn't got many heroes but he was one,"" he said. ""His heart was here."" A number of roads in the city closed for the funeral cortege which left Wolverhampton's Molineux ground and travelled to St Peter's Collegiate Church. Fans applauded as the cortege passed, chanting: ""He was one of our own."" Former cricketer Baroness Rachael Heyhoe Flint, and Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant were among those paying tribute. Lady Heyhoe Flint said the late Sir Jack had reminded her of ""a naughty schoolboy"". ""He loved to play tricks,"" she said. ""He would always try to trick me with his Black Country accent - but it was a bit too posh."" She added Sir Jack had been proud of his country and had only driven British cars. ""He asked me to check what tyres the Queen had when she visited once,"" she said. Sir Jack sold the club to Steve Morgan in 2007 for £10. Speaking to BBC WM, the Wolves chairman said of the church service: ""Fittingly the service lasted exactly ninety minutes and Sir Jack must have organised that."" Rob Gurney, BBC WM There was applause at Molineux from hundreds of supporters who have waved Sir Jack on his way. We saw a Lynx helicopter and a 671 Squadron Army Air Corps fly past - that was the regiment for whom Sir Jack served in World War Two. Appropriately enough Sir Jack, who loved all things British, made his final journey in a hearse built by Jaguar. It bore his coffin and was draped in a Union Flag. The cortege passed down the track in front of the Billy Wright stand, and left the stadium beneath a banner bearing a photo of Sir Jack with his thumbs raised and the phrase, ""Glad to have helped"" underneath. Two hundred fans, chosen by ballot, gathered in the church alongside Sir Jack's friends and family. Club chaplain Rev David Wright, led the service, said Sir Jack had organised much of it before his death. ""He chose all the music, he chose virtually all of the readings. He really had a hand in his own celebration of his life,"" he said. The man in quotes",Thousands of people lined the streets of Wolverhampton as the city said farewell to Sir Jack Hayward.
"The 17-year-old twins initially received a warm reception for their song, Shine, at Tuesday's semi-final. But when they progressed to the final, some sections of the 10,000-strong audience expressed apparent disapproval of the Russian artists. Experts have said Russia could suffer at Eurovision over the crisis in Ukraine and its stance on gay rights. Nine other countries qualified for the final on Tuesday, including Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk, whose performance was enhanced by a dancer running in a giant hamster wheel. San Marino made it through for the first time ever, marking a personal victory for singer Valentina Monetta, who has been kicked out at the semi-final stage on two previous occasions. Montenegro will also make its debut in the final, thanks to singer-songwriter Sergej Cetkovic, whose ballad Moj Svijet has echoes of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On. The oddly-named Aram Mp3 eased through for Armenia. His song Not Alone, which begins as a simple piano ballad before spinning off into dubstep, is the bookies' favourite to win on Saturday. Other hotly-tipped songs by Sweden, Hungary and Azerbaijan also qualified alongside less-favoured tracks from The Netherlands and Iceland. Latvia's novelty act Aarzemnieki were kicked out after their song Cake To Bake (""mix some dough, add some love, let it bake"") failed to impress. The next 10 qualifiers will be selected at the second semi-final on Thursday night. Last year's winner, Denmark, is already guaranteed a place, alongside the ""big five"" nations who financially support the EBU, which organises the annual contest: Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The UK's entrant is Molly Smitten-Downes - a newcomer who was selected through the BBC's Introducing scheme for unsigned acts. It is hoped her song, Children Of The Universe, will fare better than the UK's previous two entries. Bonnie Tyler placed 19th last year, while Englebert Humperdinck came second from last in 2012. Her single entered the UK chart at number 48 on Sunday, and is expected to break the top 40 after Saturday's final. Bookmakers' have upgraded her chances of Eurovision victory over recent weeks - she currently stands in the top five with odds of 6/1. The 27-year-old joked she would ""trash the green room"" if her song got ""nil points"" from the jury.",Russia's Tolmachevy Sisters were booed in Copenhagen as they qualified for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest.
"The five-day festival, being held alongside the River Thames in Berkshire in July, will also host Joss Stone and The Jacksons. Director Stewart Collins said the line-up indicated it would be ""a very strong year"". In 2013, the black tie event nearly moved to a cheaper riverbank location because of failing profits. Tickets go on sale end of March. The Sunday headliner is yet to be announced.",Bryan Ferry and Burt Bacharach have been announced as two of the 2014 headliners at the Henley Festival.
"The service was hugely popular when it ran on the new line for six weeks earlier this year. However it caused delays and disruption to the main commuter service on the route between Edinburgh and Tweedbank. Rob Dickson, the council's corporate transformation and services director, said it was a ""price worth paying"". About 6,200 passengers travelled on 17 sold-out steam journeys in September and October. It led to claims of disruption to commuter services from regular passengers. Rail workers also claimed they had to clear up raw sewage discarded from carriages pulled by the steam engine. Mr Dickson said the council was ""four-square"" behind plans to return the steam train service to the Borders. But he added: ""I think there were some short term issues. ""There were some impacts that we perhaps hadn't foreseen and there is, we have to accept in offering the steam train experience, going to be an impact on the daily commuter service. ""Now you can't have everything. ""It's great to have a successful Borders Railway, it's great to have the opportunity to offer steam, but we do need to accept that if we are going to do that there will be some impact on normal commuter services and that's something that, at least in the short to medium term, we think is a price worth paying."" He said it was unlikely that a steam train would operate on the railway for a six week block next year. ""We think we need to spread the steam train experience over the course of the year,"" he said. ""We need to find opportunities for exploiting events that take place in the Borders."" He said the Borders Book Festival, the Edinburgh Festival, rugby internationals and the Melrose Sevens could be among the events which could be hooked up to a steam train experience. A spokesman for ScotRail said: ""It was wonderful to see such high demand and they really caught people's imagination. ""We currently have no definite plans for our 2016 steam trains, but we will share these publicly as soon as the dates and locations are confirmed.""

"By Nick EardleyBBC political correspondent First minister Nicola Sturgeon has said people shouldn't be travelling across the UK - and politicians should lead by example. But Downing Street insists it is a ""fundamental role of the PM to be the physical representative of the UK government"". While London and Edinburgh debate whether the visit meets Covid guidelines, many unionists now believe making their case increasingly falls into the essential category. For months, polls have suggested support for Scottish independence is higher than that for staying the UK. We at the BBC like to be cautious around polls, but there is now a pattern: support for the Union looks weaker than ever. There are two key reasons for the increase in support for independence, which come up time and again in conversations. Both are linked to Boris Johnson. The first is Brexit. A comfortable majority of Scottish voters backed Remain in 2016 - and some of the increased support for independence appears to come from that group. That's unlikely to be helped by the fact that the most prominent Brexit backer is now prime minister. The second reason is the way the pandemic has been handled. Health is a devolved issue, so the Scottish government has been making most of the big decisions on it for the past 10 months. Although Scottish ministers admit mistakes have been made, polls suggest Scots are happy Ms Sturgeon is making the decisions and not Mr Johnson. Polling also indicates most Scots think an independent Scotland would have dealt with the pandemic better. Senior unionist campaigners and strategists in Scotland believe the Sturgeon v Johnson choice is one of their weakest points. SNP politicians only half-joke about rubbing their hands in glee when the prime minister heads north. Even senior Scottish Tories privately admit their man is just not popular in Scotland. That's why you normally see them focus on the Scottish leadership: Douglas Ross and Ruth Davidson. 'Existential threat' One unionist strategist lamented: ""Boris is a liability."" Yet this source also believes it is important for UK ministers to make regular trips to show they are engaging and making their case. ""There is a sense that Westminster Tories are suddenly paying attention... they're suddenly realising it's an existential threat,"" they said. The UK government knows it needs to make the case for the Union more forcefully - and positively. We've already looked at how it intends to say no to an independence referendum in the near future - arguing recovery from the pandemic is the priority. But in Whitehall, many acknowledge they need to do more than just say no. Expect to hear more in the coming weeks about the UK government's role in Scottish life. Note how, on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock made a point of talking about the Scottish Ambulance Service receiving support from other UK services. This isn't uncommon, and works both ways, but unionists believe it shows the strength of cooperation. ""The Union in action,"" texted one person close to the prime minister. Mr Johnson sees the vaccine programme as another example. The UK government has been responsible for procurement and the Scottish government is then responsible for distribution. ""It's a strong example of the governments of the UK working together,"" said a source. The Scottish government argues there would still be close cooperation if Scotland were independent. A senior source told me they believed the UK government had held it back at points in the pandemic - also suggesting it had failed to commit properly to a strategy to eliminate the virus earlier this year. The UK government is prepared to fund projects in devolved areas, despite the row that will cause with Holyrood, because it believes it will show that Scotland has two governments, both of which matter. None of this disguises the polling, though. Mr Johnson's government has argued for months that the furlough scheme is a perfect example of the UK in action - the Treasury supporting workers across the UK. That hasn't always worked - and even backfired when the chancellor was accused of only extending the scheme when the South of England went into lockdown, not when Scotland and Wales both asked. In London, there are debates about what to do next. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is a key figure. The PM's former deputy Brexit negotiator Oliver Lewis is playing a central role too. A cabinet committee now meets almost weekly to discuss Union strategy, with representation from the Treasury, Cabinet Office, Scotland Office, Wales Office and Northern Ireland Office. Sources talk of different strategies being floated, but say the main focus will be recovery from Covid, and arguing that's easier as part of the UK. Insiders talk about a focus on showing the tangible benefits of the Union, rather than ""constitutional tinkering"". Labour has set up a commission to look at devolution across the UK. It is being advised by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who argues the solution is as much about rediscovering the purpose of the UK as it is about moving more powers out of London. Much of this is focused on May's Holyrood election. If the SNP wins comfortably - as polls suggest it will do - it will be able to go to Westminster and say it has a mandate for another referendum. Mr Johnson has said an independence referendum should happen no more than once in a generation, but some believe that position is unsustainable. As he visits Scotland, the stakes are high.",It's a sign of these lockdown times that there's a bit of a row over whether the prime minister should be visiting Scotland at all on Thursday.
"The animal, part of the weasel family, was once common in the UK, but persecution and a loss of habitat led to its decline. The Vincent Wildlife Trust (VWT) has received more than 40 unconfirmed sightings of pine martens, one of the UK's rarest animals, in the past week. The VWT's work was touched on by BBC's Springwatch earlier this week. Pine martens are about the size of a domestic cat, and are a protected species. The BBC's Springwatch, which is based at Ynys Hir Nature Reserve in Ceredigion, has been following up sightings of the animal. The VWT said it was going through reports of 50 sightings, 40 of them in Wales, in light of the programme's coverage of the animal. The trust said pine marten numbers had grown in Scotland in recent years, but they had not recovered in Wales and England. But it believes the animal does exist in Wales in Snowdonia, the Cambrian Mountains, in areas around Aberystwyth, and parts of Carmarthenshire. The VWT's Lizzie Croose said research by the People's Trust for Endangered Species in the 1990s concluded that the pine marten was extinct in Wales. ""We've been working on pine martens in England, Wales and Scotland for about 15 years,"" she said. ""More recently, we've been working on a project called mammals in a sustainable environment, which has been examining why they are not recovering in Wales like they are in Scotland. ""We've no idea how many there are in Wales, but there is evidence they are persisting in small parts of Wales. ""Research by the People's Trust for Endangered Species in the 1990s couldn't find evidence of pine martens in Wales and declared them extinct in the country."" Ms Croose said the trust collected sightings of the animals and, over the years, had looked for droppings in the countryside. ""The last time we found pine marten droppings was in the Rheidol Valley, near Aberystwyth, in 2007,"" she said. ""We've had reports of a few sightings in the area around Aberystwyth and in parts of Snowdonia and Carmarthenshire."" 'Kill game birds' Ms Croose said there could be a few reasons why the animals were not recovering in Wales. ""It might be that numbers are so low in Wales that pine martens are not meeting to breed,"" she added. ""Perhaps the high level of fox numbers, (which attack pine martens), could be having an impact. There is research to show that pine martins have a similar diet to foxes and are attacked by foxes because of competition for food. ""Habitat destruction over the years could have also played a part, while years ago pine martens were persecuted because they were known to kill game birds and take their eggs. They were also killed for their fur.""",Reported sightings of pine martens - a creature thought to be extinct in Wales - are being investigated.
"Justine Curran said the force had to restrict leave during summer and Christmas for operational reasons. Head teachers in England can only grant absence during school time in ""exceptional circumstances"". Ms Curran has asked head teachers to use their discretion to ""fully consider"" holiday requests. In her letter, Ms Curran wrote: ""I fully support the notion that every child needs to attend school regularly and absences should be minimised wherever possible."" She said that over the summer Humberside officers would be helping to police the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Nato Summit in south Wales. 'Making exceptions' Paul Yeomans chairman of the Humberside Police Federation, which represents junior officers, said his members supported the chief constable's call. ""They're not able to take their leave during the peak times and it is not their fault,"" he said. If parents in England and Wales fail to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty notices of £50 to £100. Prosecution can result in a fine of up to £2,500, a jail sentence of up to three months or a community sentence. In a letter to Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Education Secretary Michael Gove said the Department for Education guidance to head teachers ""does not specify what constitutes exceptional circumstances"". He added: ""Neither have we said that leave of absence can or cannot be granted to families of certain occupations."" John Killeen, head of South Cave Primary School and local representative of the National Association of Head Teachers union, said there was ""inflexibility in a lot of professions"". ""We have sympathy with the police service but it would make the head teacher's position untenable with the rest if the parent body if they started making exceptions.""",The chief constable of Humberside Police has written to schools asking for the children of officers to be given holiday leave during term time.
"Writing in the Telegraph, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showed more people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. 'Time for action' Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such as his own report on the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May's Race Disparity Audit. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. What work has already been done on racial inequality in the UK? BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas. A chair has not yet been identified but the commission will be overseen by Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, with independent members also on the panel. There are expected to be public evidence sessions and legislation may follow. Lord Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote and the advisory chair of the government's Race Disparity Unit, said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement of the commission. However, he said it must lead to action and structural change, to tackle the inequalities in employment, health and education laid bare by the pandemic. Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said: ""We are in the midst of a global health pandemic that has sharply exposed deep structural inequalities which have long since needed urgently addressing."" She criticised some of Mr Johnson's words, after he told broadcasters he wanted to ""change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". Ms de Cordova described this as ""condescending"" and ""designed to let himself and his government off the hook"". Lord Woolley also said the phrase was ""frankly unhelpful… unnecessary and to some hurtful"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine said the commission was a ""welcome first step"" and showed the Black Lives Matter protests were working. But she added: ""Its findings must not become simply another report on a shelf in Whitehall - the government must implement them without delay."" Meanwhile, a survey of people's attitudes to race in Britain carried out during recent protests suggests people are increasingly optimistic that the UK will become more tolerant and diverse. When asked if they were optimistic Britain would be more tolerant and diverse in 10 years' time, two thirds of people polled by Ipsos Mori said they were, up from half in 2009. And 84% of people strongly disagreed when asked if someone has to be white to be truly British - up from 55% a decade earlier. Mr Johnson said the ""serious points"" being raised by the anti-racism demonstrators should be taken seriously. However, he said that did not mean ""wasting time"" disputing the life and opinions of ""every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone"". ""Let's fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country - thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill,"" he said. It comes as English Heritage is reviewing London's 950 blue plaques to check if any have ""problematic"" connections and will warrant extra context published about them online, as first reported in the Times. As for statues, English Heritage also said it believes the best course of action is to give extra context to ensure the stories of individuals are told ""without embellishment or excuses"".","There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality""."
"Last month, the players were cleared of rape after a nine-week trial. In a joint statement on Saturday, the IRFU and Ulster said their contracts have been revoked with ""immediate effect"". While the pair were cleared of rape, there had been controversy over social media and text messages they had exchanged. The IRFU/Ulster Rugby statement said: ""In arriving at this decision, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby acknowledge our responsibility and commitment to the core values of the game: Respect, inclusivity and integrity. ""It has been agreed, as part of this commitment, to conduct an in-depth review of existing structures and educational programmes, within the game in Ireland, to ensure the importance of these core values is clearly understood, supported and practised at every level of the game."" They also said that Ulster and Ireland winger Craig Gilroy has been sanctioned over a text message he sent to Stuart Olding. He will be unavailable for selection by Ulster until 26 April 2018. Mr Jackson and Mr Olding were cleared of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Two other men, Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. 'Sadness and regret' In a statement to the Press Association Mr Jackson said he was ""deeply disappointed"" about the outcome of the IRFU and Ulster Rugby's internal review, which was announced after the rape trial ended. ""However, I recognise that my behaviour has fallen far short of the values expected of me as an international player, a role model for the game of rugby and as a son and a brother. I am truly sorry,"" he said. ""Since I was a young boy it was my ambition to play for Ulster and Ireland and I am extremely proud, privileged and honoured to have done so. ""It is therefore with great sadness and regret, but with many cherished memories, that I leave that behind."" 'I bear no-one any ill will' Mr Olding also issued a statement: ""It is with regret that I have been informed that the IRFU have decided to revoke my contract."" He added: ""I very much wished to continue to have the opportunity to represent them [Ulster and Ireland]. ""Regrettably, influences outside of my contractual arrangement have made it impossible for that to happen. ""I said outside court that the Stuart Olding that you read about in the trial is not the real Stuart Olding. ""The treatment that I have received since my acquittal, both fair and unfair, has made me even more determined to prove myself. ""With the support of my family and friends I shall seek new challenges elsewhere. I bear no-one any ill will."" 'Monetary decision' On Sunday, a former Ulster and Ireland rugby player told the BBC that he sensed anger among fans in the wake of the decision to let the players go. Paddy Wallace said such supporters may now ""vote with their feet"" as they believe their views were not taken into consideration. Describing the decision as one that was motivated by money, Mr Wallace said: ""Ulster felt they needed to protect their sponsors rather than the players involved. ""That could come back to bite them, because a lot of the supporters are thinking: 'Do I renew my season ticket, do I come to the games, do I put money across the bar?' ""The CEO [Shane Logan] has been invisible through this whole process and a lot of fans are very disgruntled about that. ""Some are feeling a disconnect and the easiest thing to do is vote with their feet."" Ulster players have expressed their ""sadness"" at the departures of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding following the termination of their contracts. Kingspan rally On Friday evening, hundreds of people staged a protest outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast ahead of Ulster Rugby's match against Ospreys. The rally was organised by Belfast Feminist Network. Last week, a crowd-funded advertisement was taken out in a Belfast newspaper calling for Mr Jackson and Mr Olding to be dropped by Ulster and Ireland. It described the Whatsapp messages that emerged during the trial as ""reprehensible"". Mr Jackson later apologised for the messages. However, a separate advert was published days later, calling on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"" to playing duties. That advert was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". On Thursday, one of Ulster Rugby's key sponsors, Bank of Ireland, said it was ""highly concerned"" by issues arising out of the rape trial. In a statement on Saturday, it said: ""We welcome the in-depth review of structures and education programmes which has been announced today, and look forward to the recommendations which arise being put into effect.""",Ulster and Ireland rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have had their contracts terminated.
"Cabinet members were told to restrict their movements after Health Minister Stephen Donnelly reported he felt unwell on Tuesday afternoon. Initially it was announced they would have to self-isolate and parliament would be adjourned indefinitely. But Mr Donnelly tested negative and the Dáil resumed business later on Tuesday. ""The idea that all of government would grind to a halt because one person, one individual minister had to be tested raises some serious questions as to how organised the government is,"" Ms McDonald said. ""If there isn't a sufficiently robust protocol then we are certainly going to have to re-visit it"". On Wednesday, the National Public Health Emergency Team confirmed there had been three more deaths and 254 new Covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 1,788 in the country. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Foyle, Ms McDonald said: ""We are looking at dealing and living with this virus for quite some time to come and the idea of government in Dublin, or indeed in Belfast, not functioning is not a runner. ""You have to have an organised plan and a protocol and you must act safely but you should ensure that, to the best of your ability, services continue. ""In the times we are in with the Covid crisis, a Brexit crisis looming, the last thing we need in Dublin is a cabinet that cannot function."" Raised eyebrows The Sinn Féin president also questioned the speed with which Mr Donnelly received his coronavirus test results. ""The health minister was very lucky to get the results from his test within a matter of hours, which is not the experience for countless regular citizens,"" she said. ""It has raised some eyebrows and raised questions on the testing and tracing system."" Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin said the decision for the cabinet to restrict their movements came from ""an abundance of caution"". The Ceann Comhairle (Speaker) Seán Ó Feargháil told the Dáil shortly after 17:00 local time that after ""very serious information arising out of events today, the cabinet must now self-isolate"". However, the Dáil reconvened after 20:00, with Mr Ó Feargháil explaining that he had been advised the parliament should be adjourned and then recalled by the taoiseach. Mr Donnelly had attended a press conference on Tuesday morning when the Irish government unveiled a five-stage plan on living with Covid-19. 'Dublin left in limbo' The coronavirus plan outlined by the Irish government outlined stricter rules for Dublin over the next few weeks because of the increase in infections in the city. Pubs that do not serve food can reopen on 21 September, except in Dublin where they must stay closed. Visits to homes in the city are now limited to six people - with guests allowed from just one household. Ms McDonald said the plan was not clear and called for clarity on Dublin restrictions. ""We need the government to be straight with the people of Dublin to let the city and county know where things are at and what the course of action is,"" she said. She added that it was ""crucial"" to get testing right. 'Concerning trends' Later on Wednesday, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the situation was deteriorating not just in Dublin but also on a national level. ""Along with Dublin we have seen particularly concerning trends in (counties) Louth, Waterford and Donegal,"" he said. ""It is now absolutely essential that people action public health advice and act as if they or those close to them are potentially infectious,"" Dr Glynn added. The R number, the average number of people an infected person passes Covid-19 on to after contracting the disease, is between 1.3 - 1.7, health authorities said. Prof Philip Nolan from NPHET said he is ""more concerned than I have been at any point since late April"".

"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales Annoyed by the Labour leader's questions about the NHS in England, the prime minister accused Mr Miliband of having no solutions on the NHS: ""Presumably if he had any solutions he would have implemented them in Wales."" Mr Cameron did strike a (slightly) conciliatory tone - when faced with criticisms of the NHS in England - in acknowledging there were ""challenges"" facing the service across the UK. (Funnily enough, ""challenges"" is the word Ed Miliband uses when asked about Labour's NHS record in Wales). He added: ""If Labour has an answer to the NHS can they explain why they cut the budget in Wales by 8%. That is where Labour is in charge. All parts of the United Kingdom face a health challenge but the real risk to the NHS is the risk of unfunded spending commitments bringing chaos to our economy which would wreck our NHS."" Later, he told MPs the NHS in England was outperforming the NHS in Wales, although - possibly to the relief of Conservative MPs - there was no mention of Offa's Dyke. in the House of Commons even if there was in his Radio Wales interview this morning. Just before Christmas, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb told the Western Mail that he had asked cabinet colleagues to mind their language when talking about the NHS in Wales. One can only imagine Mr Crabb's frustration over the way the prime minister's defence of his remarks has generated headlines that overshadowed what the secretary of state saw as his most significant political and economic speech since taking the job. *(News from Paris emerged in time for the party leaders to condemn events there although there was little debate on the issue).","To no-one's surprise, the NHS dominated the first prime minister's questions of 2015*.

"Pheu Thai Party sources said Ms Shinawatra left Thailand last week. It was revealed on Friday that Ms Yingluck, who is charged with negligence, had gone abroad but the destination was not known. When she failed to appear in court, an arrest warrant was issued and her bail was confiscated. Dubai is where her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, lives in self-imposed exile. He went there to avoid a 2008 jail sentence for corruption. ""We heard that she went to Cambodia and then Singapore, from where she flew to Dubai. She has arrived safely and is there now,"" a senior member of the Shinawatras' party told Reuters. Deputy national police chief Gen Srivara Rangsibrahmanakul said police had no record of Ms Yingluck leaving the country and were following the matter closely. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said Ms Yingluck's location would ""be clear soon"". Judges have postponed the negligence verdict until 27 September. Ms Yingluck, 50, has denied any wrongdoing in the rice subsidy scheme, which cost Thailand billions of dollars. If found guilty at the end of the two-year trial, she could be jailed for up to 10 years and permanently banned from politics. How could Yingluck Shinawatra have left? Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, Bangkok Yingluck Shinawatra was the most high-profile criminal defendant in Thailand and was constantly monitored by the military authorities. So how was she able to leave the country just hours before the verdict was due to be read out? Immigration authorities say they have no record of her leaving the country. However, it is a poorly-concealed secret that some in the military government would have been happy to see her leave the country before the verdict. Had she been convicted and jailed, she could have been seen as a victim by her supporters. The government was nervous about their reaction. Acquitting her, though, would have been equally unacceptable to her hard-line opponents, many of them very influential. That would also have undermined the justification for the military coup which overthrew her government. So it is unlikely anyone tried to stop her leaving, or that they will try to get her back. What happened in court? Ms Yingluck's lawyer had requested a delay in the ruling, telling the Supreme Court that she had vertigo and a severe headache and was unable to attend. But the court said in a statement that it did not believe she was sick as there was no medical certificate, and that the alleged sickness was not severe enough to prevent her travelling to court. ""Such behaviour convincingly shows that she is a flight risk. As a result, the court has issued an arrest warrant and confiscated the posted bail money,"" the statement said. Ms Yingluck posted $900,000 (£703,000) bail at the beginning of her trial. Friday's turn of events took many by surprise, including the hundreds of people who turned up outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok to support Ms Yingluck. What is the trial about? Ms Yingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister in 2011, was impeached in 2015 over the rice scheme by a military-backed legislature, which then brought the legal case. The scheme, part of Ms Yingluck's election campaign platform, was launched shortly after she took office. It was aimed at boosting farmers' incomes and alleviating rural poverty, and saw the government paying farmers nearly twice the market rate for their crop. But it hit Thailand's rice exports hard, leading to a loss of at least $8bn and huge stockpiles of rice which the government could not sell. Though it was popular with her rural voter base, opponents said the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption. During her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme. She has insisted she is a victim of political persecution. How popular is Yingluck Shinawatra? Her time in office was overshadowed by controversy as well as strong political opposition. The youngest sister of Mr Thaksin, she was seen by her opponents as a proxy for her brother, who was controversially ousted by the military in 2006. Both siblings remain popular among the rural poor, but are hated by an urban and middle-class elite. Their Pheu Thai party has - under various different names - won every election in Thailand since 2001. Timeline of Yingluck's rice scheme controversy May 2011- Yingluck Shinawatra is elected PM, and shortly afterwards begins rolling out her rice subsidy scheme January 2014 - Thailand's anti-corruption authorities investigate Ms Yingluck in connection to the scheme May 2014 - She is forced to step down from her post after Thailand's constitutional court finds her guilty of abuse of power in another case. Weeks later the military ousts what remains of her government January 2015 - An army-backed legislature impeaches Ms Yingluck for corruption over her role in the rice scheme, which effectively bans her from politics for five years. It also launches legal proceedings against her August 2017 - Ms Yingluck fails to appear at court for the verdict, claiming ill health. It is later revealed she left for Dubai","Thailand's ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra fled to Dubai ahead of the verdict in her trial over a rice subsidy scheme, members of her party have said."

"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News A major UK internet service provider (ISP) said peer-to-peer (P2P) activity on its network returned to just below normal only a week after the measures were enforced earlier this year. Critics had warned the ban would prove ineffective. But the BPI, the music industry trade body, has defended the action. Its chief executive Geoff Taylor told the BBC the group would continue to pursue similar action in future. ""We'll take further steps to deal with illegal sites that line their pockets by ripping off everyone who makes the music we enjoy."" The ISP - which shared the data with the BBC on condition of anonymity - said P2P traffic had peaked in the days court proceedings were taking place, largely due to increased media coverage. Immediately after the ban was enforced on its network, the ISP said P2P activity had dropped by over 11% compared to average levels. ""We saw a fall at the time of the block,"" the source said, ""made more dramatic by the increasing amount of such traffic in the weeks leading up to it. ""But volumes are already pretty much back to where they were before."" 'Whack-a-mole' The firm stressed that the figures related to the volume of P2P traffic, not necessarily the number of users. This made it possible, it said, that ""hardcore"" file-sharers might have become more prolific since the ban while casual users have been discouraged. In addition, the data is not able to distinguish precisely what material is downloaded and from where - meaning users may be using sites other than The Pirate Bay to access files. However Loz Kaye, leader of the Pirate Party UK which has campaigned against the ban, said a renewal in sharing of copyrighted files was ""inevitable"". ""We've always said that blocking is an ineffective method,"" he told the BBC. ""It's not in any way productive. Anyone who knows anything about how the internet works can get around it."" His party has set up a proxy server to allow users to still access The Pirate Bay, even if it has been blocked by their provider. 'More to do' April's court decision has meant six of the UK's major ISPs have been forced to block the site. It followed a similar case in 2011 involving Newzbin 2, another file-sharing service. The BPI, which represents rights holders in the UK, obtained the most recent court order on the grounds that The Pirate Bay ""infringes copyright on a massive scale"". In response to the new data, it argued that the measures had been effective - but admitted that more work was required. ""The goal of our action was to reduce UK use of The Pirate Bay, which was causing particular harm to British musicians and labels,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Before the court case, the site was one of the top 50 most popular sites in the UK. Today it has fallen to number 282. ""We recognise there is more to do to reduce illegal P2P use overall.""","A drop in file-sharing following a court ordered block of the Pirate Bay was short-lived, data seen by the BBC suggests."
"Jasvir Ram Ginday, 29, from Walsall, attacked Varkha Rani at their home with a metal pipe from a vacuum cleaner. He strangled her then burnt her body in a garden incinerator, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. Judge John Warner told the court Ginday had struggled ""being a gay man in a straight world"". He told him he would serve a minimum of 21 years in prison. Ginday, of Victory Lane, had flown to attend his arranged wedding to Varkha, 24, from India, at a lavish ceremony attended by up to 700 guests last year. But he had told a friend he was attracted to men as early as 2008, said prosecutor Deborah Gould. West Midlands Police said Ginday was frequenting gay bars and having relationships with men around the time of his engagement to Varkha. In August, six months after the ceremony, Varkha arrived in the UK to join her husband and live together in the matrimonial home. But on 12 September, university graduate and IT specialist Ginday - who had been preparing to take up a job with the Financial Ombudsman Service in London - had a row with his new wife. During the trial, Ginday had alleged his wife had threatened to ""expose"" him as homosexual to family and friends, after apparently discovering ""compromising"" material on an iPad and iPhone. He told the jury that his wife had come at him in the bedroom, ""thrashing"", and he was ""trying to calm her down"". The pair ended up on the floor, at which point he claimed he grabbed the metal pipe of a vacuum cleaner which was lying nearby and ""in the spur of the moment"" put it on her neck. Ginday said he then ""panicked"", dragged his new bride to the patio incinerator and placed her inside using a metal pole. After the killing, the police said Ginday told his relatives Varkha had left him. He went to Walsall Police Station with his uncle and reported her as missing. Officers conducting inquiries in the area were told people had seen smoke emanating from the property. They went into the garden of the home Ginday shared with his parents and found the metal incinerator. When they lifted the lid, they saw a human skull. Although he admitted manslaughter and perverting the course of justice, he denied planning to kill his wife. In sentencing Judge John Warner said: ""Killing her was a dreadful enough thing to have done, but what followed was horrible almost beyond imagining. ""You behaved in an unbelievably casual and callous way, with a complete lack of any humanity. ""No-one who was in court to hear that evidence will easily put out of their minds, the image of her body being poked and prodded by you down into that incinerator."" Varkha's cousin Sunil Kumar said: ""No words can truly express the sadness and hurt my family and I are experiencing at the loss of Varkha. She was loved dearly by all. She had a great passion for life and doted on her family. ""Varkha attained a masters degree and was driven to make her life a success. Unfortunately she fell prey to Ginday who had ulterior motives which Varkha would not have appreciated."" Det Ch Insp Sarbjit Johal said: ""How Varkha met her death still remains a mystery... but it was clear to the pathologist she was dead when she was put into the incinerator. ""Ginday got married as a matter of convenience - he tricked a poor innocent girl into marriage but was living a lie. When she uncovered the truth he could not live with it and killed her quickly then tried to dispose of her body and her possessions by burning them.""",A bank worker has been jailed for life for murdering his wife in a bid to stop her revealing his homosexuality.
"A master plan for the whole town, which is expected to have 10,000 houses when completed, has also been submitted. The initial phase includes a primary school, sports hub, shops and a recycling centre. The plans have been put forward by developer Gallagher and the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). Shona Johnston, county councillor for Longstanton which includes Northstowe, said: ""It's going to be vitally important that we get Northstowe right, right at the start. ""We've got to make sure we develop a proper community that people want to live in and can be happy in."" Public response Northstowe will be built at the former Oakington barracks site, which was subsequently used as an immigration detention centre until 2010. Gallagher and the HCA submitted their plans after working with a consortium of 12 parish councils and asking the public for responses. The greatest number of comments about the plans related to the need for the A14 to be upgraded and finding ways to reduce congestion on the dual carriageway. Upgrading the A14 was considered an essential part of the initial Northstowe proposal, but the coalition government shelved this plan. However, the new town will be served by a public transport system in the form of the guided busway, which was opened by Cambridgeshire County Council in 2011. The first 1,500 houses will be built next to Longstanton's busway stop. Councillor Tim Wotherspoon, SCDC's cabinet member for Northstowe and new communities, said: ""The town is vital to responding to the acute housing need in South Cambridgeshire. ""We will be publishing the plans and consulting with residents to make sure they have their say.""","Developers have submitted a planning application to South Cambridgeshire District Council (SCDC) for the first 1,500 houses at Northstowe."
"Income fell during 2013 and the overall deficit reached £24.8m, up £4.8m compared with 2012. Deputy Gavin St Pier said: ""We do need to stay focused on closing the deficit and we have concerns over the sustainability of our revenue."" He said a review of personal tax, pensions and benefits was needed. Deputy St Pier said: ""Our deficit position in 2013 is largely as a result of the deterioration in revenues. ""Eighty percent of our income taxes come from individuals and 78% of general revenue comes from income tax."" A five-year saving programme aimed at cutting £31m from annual spending, which will not be achieved, is due to finish at the end of this year. The deficit began in 2008 due to the introduction of a zero-10 corporation tax. Under that system most corporations in Guernsey paid no tax, while others pay 10% and a small number pay 20%. Previously all companies paid about 6%. In 2013, the tax rate for insurance and fiduciary businesses was increased from 0% to 10%. That increased taxes from £40.3m in 2012 to £44.1m, but was £6.4m short of what was expected. There was a fall in individual tax by £400,000 to £227.1m and other taxes - property tax, company fees, document duty, excise and import duties - fell by £1.3m to £76.1m. Document duty, paid when properties are sold, decreased by £1.6m to £15.5m, due to a 9% fall in annual sales.","More needs to done to balance the States' books, Guernsey's treasury minister said as the States deficit rose by nearly £5m."
"Demonstrators carried football-style red cards as a warning to Mr Zeman, while others threw eggs. One accidentally hit the German president. Many are angry with Mr Zeman, who they see as too sympathetic to Russia. The Velvet Revolution began on 17 November 1989 when police attacked a student protest. A wave of demonstrations followed across the now Czech Republic, toppling the communist government and replacing it with one led by dissident playwright Vaclav Havel. Some Czechs feel that certain aims of the revolution, such as the promotion of human rights, have been sidelined by Mr Zeman. They also worry that the president, a former communist, is too close to both Russia and China. Booed and jeered On Monday, demonstrators carried banners reading ""down with Zeman"" and ""we do not want to be a Russian colony"". As the president unveiled a plaque to the students involved in the 1989 protest, he was booed, jeered and pelted with eggs. Though Mr Zeman appears not to have been hit, German President Joachim Gauck was struck during the attack. Analysis: Rob Cameron, BBC Prague correspondent The egg incident has already been subjected to presidential spin. A Czech spokesman said Germany's President Gauck was ""in shock"" after being hit in the temple; the Germans said Mr Gauck had been struck by a small fragment of egg shell and had laughed it off. Mr Zeman's guests, though, must surely be taken aback by the level of hostility towards the Czech leader on what was supposed to be a solemn national occasion. Mr Zeman himself told the crowd he was unafraid of them, and pointed out that he too had been there on 17 November 1989. But his claim that the riot police's violent suppression of the peaceful student protest was ""no bloodbath"" and ""one of many such events"" has been roundly condemned. Mr Zeman angered many Czech citizens when he defended Russia's stance on Ukraine, declaring the conflict there ""a civil war between two groups of Ukrainian citizens"". Though Moscow has long denied any direct involvement in the Ukraine crisis, the EU, of which the Czech Republic is a member, has imposed sanctions on Russia, saying it has supplied separatist rebels there with weapons and Russian fighters. The Czech president also used derogatory language when discussing Russian protest group Pussy Riot in an expletive-filled interview earlier this month. In October he shocked some when he said he wished to learned how China ""stabilised"" its society. In the run-up to Monday's celebrations, Mr Zeman said the 1989 student protest had not triggered the Velvet Revolution. Despite his participation in it, Mr Zeman said the historic protest had been just one of ""any number of rallies"" and he played down police brutality. Mr Zeman still has the backing of many voters and his supporters were scheduled to hold a rally on Monday. Also on Monday, Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka travelled to the US to unveil a bust of Vaclav Havel in Congress. The former president died in 2011.","Thousands of people have protested against Czech President Milos Zeman on the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, which ended communist rule."
"Women spent more time on unpaid childcare and housework over the past year than men, and were more likely to be furloughed. More men than women have died with Covid-19 in England and Wales. But men were more likely to be unconcerned by the effects of coronavirus on their lives. When asked how anxious they felt, women's anxiety levels have been much higher than men's since March 2020, something also seen before the pandemic. During the first peak, loneliness was the biggest cause of anxiety - and women were more likely than men to feel lonely. Housework and childcare While both women and men spent more time working from home during the pandemic, women were more likely to be furloughed. They did more of the housework - about 2.75 hours every day during September and October. This compares with an average of 1 hour 40 minutes done by men per day. At the start of the first lockdown, women spent 55% more time than men looking after their children, and this rose to even higher levels in the autumn. In spring 2020, one in three women said home-schooling children was negatively affecting their wellbeing, compared with only one in five men. But by last month, home-schooling was taking a greater toll on both women and men, with about half saying it was having a damaging effect. Some 67% of women and 52% of men were home-schooling a child this spring while schools were closed to most pupils during lockdown. Men's health risk Men are more at risk of being seriously ill and dying with Covid-19 than women - a fact which has been known since the early days of the pandemic - along with people over 70 and those with underlying health conditions. This is thought to be because men are more likely to have heart disease, type 2 diabetes and chronic lung disease - all conditions which increase risk. Men are also more likely to be obese - a known risk factor for severe Covid-19 - but scientists say there may also be genetic factors at play too. As a result, 18% more men than women have died in England and Wales with Covid-19 - 63,700 compared with 53,300. At the height of the first peak, 5,000 men and 3,600 women died in England and Wales. This gap appeared to close slightly in the January peak when 4,600 men and 4,200 women died. Even in working-age people aged 20-64, men were nearly twice as likely to die as women (31 deaths per 100,000 compared to 17 per 100,000) over the past year.

"Since Donald Trump became US president 19 months ago, there has been no shortage of spectacle. But there have been few days as eventful or potentially impactful as 21 August, 2018. This is how that day unfolded. The build-up Since May 2017, a special investigation headed by former FBI chief Robert Mueller has been looking into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and whether Donald Trump's victorious campaign team colluded with Russia. Among the first of the 32 people and three companies charged as part of the investigation was Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign chief. Meanwhile, another investigation stemming from the special counsel has been bubbling under the surface for a few months: New York prosecutors have been examining the dealings of Mr Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What happened next? 21 August - 09:30 eastern time (14:30 BST) In Alexandria, Virginia, a jury is starting its fourth day of deliberations in Mr Manafort's trial - he faces 18 allegations of falsifying his tax returns, committing bank fraud, and failing to file reports of foreign bank accounts. The two-week trial is the first to emerge from the special counsel investigation. Among the witnesses for the prosecution was Rick Gates, Mr Manafort's former right-hand man. In accusing Mr Manafort of not declaring all his income, the prosecution had detailed his extravagant purchases - including a $15,000 (£11,640) ostrich jacket. 11:36 There are signs the jury in Virginia may be close to returning a verdict - news agencies reveal that jurors have asked the judge what they should do if they cannot reach a unanimous conclusion. 11:59 In breaking news, MSNBC report that Mr Cohen is in talks about a possible plea deal. Over the next 90 minutes, the news is confirmed by a number of other US media outlets. 12:04 An urgent line by the Reuters news agency drops: Judge in Manafort trial instructs jury to continue deliberations 13:30 At a court in Washington DC, another former Trump official charged under the Mueller investigation - former national security adviser Michael Flynn - is due to be sentenced. However, in a note to the court, Mr Mueller's team says it is not yet ready to sentence him. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says this is a sign that Flynn, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the presidential transition, is still co-operating with Mr Mueller and that his usefulness to the investigation is ongoing. 14:42 The Associated Press reveal that a plea deal has been reached in the Cohen case. Media report that he will appear before a federal court in Manhattan at 16:00. 16:05 Mr Cohen arrives at court. 16:25 An urgent line by Reuters flashes in newsrooms: Jury reaches verdict in bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Manafort Over the next 10 minutes, the full verdict is read out: Manafort is found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. But the jury fails to reach a verdict on 10 other charges and the judge declares a mistrial on those. Manafort could face up to 80 years in jail. 16:31 The judge in the Cohen case reveals that the former Trump lawyer is to plead guilty to at least five counts of tax fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. 16:35 Once the full verdict in the Manafort trial becomes clear, reporters sprint out of the Alexandria courthouse in droves to break the news to their outlets. About 90 seconds after the first group of runners, NBC intern Cassie Semyon bursts out and goes on to find viral fame. 16:50 Cohen pleads guilty to eight charges, including the violation of campaign finance laws, after paying off women who alleged they had had affairs with Mr Trump. Cohen directly implicates the president by stating that he followed the orders of a ""candidate for federal office"" by making the payments, for the ""principal purpose of influencing [the] election"". It is not yet clear, despite his plea deal, whether Cohen is co-operating with the special counsel investigation. The deal does mean he could face a reduced jail sentence, of up to five years and three months. 17:19 Robert Khuzami, the prosecutor in the Cohen case, hold a press conference outside the federal court in Manhattan. ""These are very serious charges and reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over an extended period of time,"" he says. 17:38 President Trump emerges from Air Force One in Charleston, West Virginia, where he will be taking part in a rally later that night. Reporters shout, asking whether he has any reaction to the Manafort and Cohen cases as he walks down the steps. He doesn't immediately reply but later walks over to the gathered journalists. ""Paul Manafort is a good man,"" he says. ""He was with Ronald Reagan, he was with a lot of different people over the years and I feel very sad about that. It doesn't involve me, very sad thing that happened, nothing to do with Russian collusion, absolutely nothing to do with - it's a witch hunt and a disgrace."" He doesn't address the Michael Cohen plea deal. 21:32 In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis says his client is happy to co-operate with the Russia investigation. ""Mr Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest in the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows,"" he says.","Two dramatic moments in court, only minutes apart."
"His 83-year-old half-brother, Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed, has been named by the cabinet as his successor. In July, Sheikh Sabah was flown to the United States for medical treatment following surgery for an unspecified condition in Kuwait that month. He had ruled the oil-rich Gulf Arab state since 2006 and had overseen its foreign policy for more than 50 years. He was dubbed the ""dean of Arab diplomacy"" for his efforts to restore relations with states that backed Iraq during the 1990-1991 Gulf War, when Kuwait was invaded by Iraqi forces. The emir also often acted as a mediator in regional disputes, including the ongoing diplomatic stand-off between Saudi Arabia, its allies and Qatar. Kuwait similarly refrained from intervening in Syria's civil war, instead hosting several donor conferences for humanitarian aid. ""Today we lost a big brother and a wise and loving leader... who spared no effort for Arab unity,"" Jordan's King Abdullah II wrote on Twitter in Arabic. Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, tweeted: ""Sheikh Sabah epitomised wisdom, tolerance, and peace and he was a great pioneer of Gulf cooperation."" UN Secretary General António Guterres called the emir ""an extraordinary symbol of wisdom and generosity, a messenger of peace, a bridge builder"". Calming, mediating force Tiny, oil-rich and vulnerable, Kuwait has long been both an ally of the West and dependant on it for protection. Britain has twice sent troops to defend it from its giant neighbour Iraq, first in 1961 and then in 1991 as part of the massive US-led Desert Storm campaign to expel Saddam Hussein's forces. Despite being ruled by ageing men from the long-standing Al-Sabah dynasty, Kuwait has one of the more lively political scenes in the Arab world, with elected MPs able to call government ministers to account. This has sometimes led to political paralysis. The ruling family also took on conservative religious opinion by pushing for women to be allowed to vote and run for political office. In recent years Kuwait has been seen as a calming, mediating force in the region, helped by the late emir's decades of experience as foreign minister. The succession is thought likely to be a smooth one. Sheikh Sabah's death was announced on state television on Tuesday afternoon by the Minister of Emiri Diwan (Court) Affairs, Sheikh Ali Jarrah al-Sabah. ""With the utmost sadness and grief for the Kuwaiti people, the Islamic and Arab world and people of friendly nations, the Emiri Diwan mourns the death of Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah, the emir of Kuwait, who is now next to God"" he said. Sheikh Jarrah did not give a cause of death. Born in 1929, Sheikh Sabah was the great-grandson of the founder of modern Kuwait, Mubarak al-Sabah, who signed a ""Treaty of Friendship"" with Britain in 1899 that saw it become a protectorate. Sheikh Sabah became Kuwait's foreign minister in 1963 - two years after Britain recognised Kuwait's independence - and held the position until 1991, following the end of the seven-month-long Iraqi occupation. He was reappointed foreign minister in 1992 and served until 2003, when he was named prime minister by his half-brother Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad. Sheikh Sabah became Kuwait's ruler himself in 2006, after Sheikh Jaber died and his cousin Emir Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah stepped down just nine days into his rule as parliament moved to depose him on health grounds. Kuwait - which has a population of 4.8 million, including 3.4 million foreign workers - has the world's sixth-largest known oil reserves and is a major US ally. The emirate's parliament has the most powers of any elected body in the Gulf and opposition MPs openly criticise the Sabahs. However, the ruling family retains full control over key government and executive posts and the emir has the last say in political matters. He also has the power to override or dissolve parliament, and call elections. Sheikh Sabah dissolved parliament or reshuffled his cabinet a number of times after lawmakers sought to question or submit votes of no confidence against senior ministers, including members of the ruling family.","Kuwait's Emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, has died at the age of 91, state media report."
"By Guy HedgecoeMadrid The 32-year-old mother-of-two, named by Spanish media as Verónica Rubio, took her own life on Saturday. It is being treated as a case of revenge porn - the non-consensual sharing of sexual images online. Last week work colleagues had shared the video, reportedly recorded five years earlier, before she was married, by a former partner. Spanish media report that she hanged herself the day after her husband saw the video. ""It's not manly to make a video like this go viral,"" the famous matador Fran Rivera, 45, told Espejo Público, a television programme, when asked about the case. ""But men, and I say this because I'm a man, were unable to have such a video and not share it."" Although he also said that the deceased woman was ""not to blame"" his comments provoked immediate criticism. ""Sharing a video without permission is a crime,"" tweeted television presenter Cristina Pedroche. ""Once again women are being blamed. Let's not focus on the woman who made the video, but on the man who shared it and on those who didn't denounce it."" The spokeswoman for the leftist Podemos party, Irene Montero, mocked the bullfighter's comment, tweeting: ""We [women] have to be coy and careful how we behave, because a man can't see a video 'like this' and not share it. That's not naive idiocy, it's the kind of logic that blames women in order to hide sexism."" Actress Sara Sálamo tweeted: ""How lucky that most of the men I interact with are not like you, Fran Rivera."" Reacting to the criticisms, the bullfighter later tweeted a clip of his TV interview, with the message: ""Seeing reality is better than seeing manipulation"". The furore adds fuel to an intense political debate in Spain about harassment and violence targeting women. Read more on related topics: The victim worked at a vehicle plant east of Madrid belonging to Iveco. The in-house representative body for staff there said: ""We are still in shock and are overwhelmed by grief and outrage. We all know that this should not have happened."" The video started circulating on 20 May and by the middle of the week the attention and ridicule the victim was receiving from colleagues, hundreds of whom had seen it, were causing her severe anguish. She reportedly left work early on 24 May to recover and her body was discovered at her home in Alcalá de Henares the next day. She left behind two small children. Spanish media say police are investigating a male employee at the plant who previously had a relationship with the victim. Nobody has been charged over the case so far. The Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) labour union, which represents workers at the plant, said the victim had complained to her employers, on the Thursday before her death, about the video and the male colleague who had allegedly shared it via WhatsApp. Soledad Murillo, Spain's Secretary of State for Equality, described this as a case of gender violence. ""Sexism is about power relations,"" she said. ""Who are you to have an image that does not belong to you and to make her the focus of a scandal?"" In a comparable case in Italy, 31-year-old Tiziana Cantone killed herself in 2016, more than a year after sex videos in which she featured had gone viral. Spanish law on such cases - often described as ""revenge porn"" - was tightened in 2015, following the case of Olvido Hormigos, a local politician from Toledo, who made a sex video which went viral after her lover shared it. Now, anyone who makes public content of a sexual nature without the consent of those involved can face a jail sentence of between three and 12 months or a fine. Feminists and other groups have staged mass protests in Spain against the sexist attitudes blamed for gender violence. In a notorious case, five men known as La Manada (""the wolf pack"") were found guilty of sexually abusing a young woman in Pamplona in 2016. Although they were each sentenced to nine years in prison, the five had rape charges dropped, drawing widespread anger and women's protests. The sentences are currently under review in the supreme court.",A top Spanish bullfighter has drawn a fierce backlash for his comments on the case of a young woman who killed herself days after a sex video featuring her was widely shared.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The post-apocalyptic first-person shooter was developed by Bungie. It was the US studio's first release after quitting the Halo series. The title attracted mixed reviews, and its relatively bare-bones plot continues to divide gamers. The award surprised many in the audience at the London ceremony as it had not won any of the other categories it had been nominated for. However, Bungie's skill at crafting alien-slaying gunfights appears to have helped it seize the top prize. Accepting the award Bungie's president thanked Destiny's players. ""It's always a labour of love that we do because of the passion of the fans,"" said Harold Ryan. ""They really are the ones who drive you to put the energy and time into putting the game together."" Several other biggest-budget nominees - including Assassin's Creed Unity, Mario Kart 8 and Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare - walked away without a prize. Big name losers In fact, many of the winners managed to secure what might be seen as David-and-Goliath battles. OlliOlii - the low-budget skateboarding video game from London-based studio Roll7 - beat both Fifa 15 and Forza Horizon 2 for the best sport video game. The actress Ashley Johnson defeated the Hollywood star Kevin Spacey to win the best performance award for Ellie in The Last of Us: Left Behind. And the puzzle game Lumino City - which was created using real-world models made out of paper, card, miniature lights and motors - beat Ubisoft's Far Cry 4 and Assassin's Creed Unity for artistic achievement. Monument Valley won British game of the year. Its developers, UsTwo Games sparked a brief backlash in November after charging £1.49 for extra levels - a fee many gamers thought justified after trying them out. The title also took the mobile and handheld category. Alien: Isolation, by Sussex-based The Creative Assembly, only walked away with the audio achievement prize despite entering the ceremony as the favourite with six nominations. Return winner The awards were hosted by the comedian Rufus Hound - his first time in the role. His opening monologue poked fun at the rising number of video games that sell expensive downloadable content in the months following the original title's release. However, that did not stop last year's big winner, The Last of Us, from also scooping up the best story award for its add-on tale, Left Behind. Analysis: Adam Rosser, presenter of Radio 5 live's Game On There was an audible ripple of surprise in the press room as Destiny took the best game Bafta. Destiny has been criticised in many quarters for being the epitome of ""grind"", suffering from a sparsely populated game world and repetitive gameplay. In many people's minds the game has struggled to integrate two genres: the first-person shooter and the massively multiplayer online (MMO) game. That was always going to be a tall order. As was following the well-thought of Halo series, which Bungie built its reputation on. Destiny took the template that Halo established and spun a similar aesthetic out into a different kind of universe. One in which Earth is threatened by ""the Darkness"", a nebulous adversary that wouldn't be out of place in a Luc Besson film, and the central ""character"" in the game, The Traveller is a mute orb in whose shadow the last safe city on Earth is founded. There are good ideas scattered through the game but at present, several DLC (downloadable content) releases in, it still manages to feel unfinished. In a strong category - up against Alien: Isolation, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and even Mario Kart 8 - the decision to give the most high profile award to Destiny looks, to many, like an eccentric one. Listen to Game On's weekly podcast Paying respects The awards this year introduced a new category - best persistent game, representing titles whose action continues even when the player is not taking part. Destiny had been nominated for the prize, but it went instead to Riot Games' hugely popular League of Legends. Following the announcement, Mr Hound paused to pay tribute to the fantasy author Terry Pratchett, whose death had been announced hours earlier, and the late Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy, who voiced several video games. There was also a sombre moment following the award for ""original property"" when the team behind Ubisoft Studio's Valiant Hearts paid their respects to the Word War I soldiers who had inspired its puzzle adventure. This year's winner in the ""ones to watch"" category was Overly Kinetic, a development team made up of students from the University of Southern California. They created the distinctive ""stealth-deathmatch"" multiplayer game Chambara, in which four players camouflage themselves in the game's environment while trying to sneak up on and attack each other. The category is linked to the Dare to be Digital competition run by Abertay University, which gives contestants nine weeks to create a prototype, and is intended to bring attention to new talent. Another American team, albeit a more experienced one, celebrated taking the ""multiplayer game of the year"" prize - Blizzard Entertainment for Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft. The developer beat Destiny for the prize. The creators of the strategy card game revealed during their acceptance speech that some in their studio were dubious about its prospects before its release. The title - which is a spin-off from the role-playing game World of Warcraft - recently revealed it had attracted 25 million registered players. Fellowship David Braben - the creator of Elite and its most recent sequel Elite: Dangerous - received a standing ovation when he took to the stage to be given the Bafta fellowship by another British gaming legend, Ian Livingstone. Mr Braben suggested that we are on the ""cusp of a golden age for video gaming"". ""The rise of the indies is truly amazing,"" he said. ""It's the best time there has been to be in this wonderful industry."" He thanked members of the public who had crowdfunded his latest title and his colleagues at Frontier Developments. At one point it had seemed that Elite: Dangerous would not raise its target of £1.25m on Kickstarter, which would have meant it would have missed out on the seed money. Microsoft recently revealed that the title would soon be released for its Xbox One console following its success on PC.",Destiny has been named as best game at 2015's British Academy Game Awards.
"The PM has just chaired a cabinet meeting on Brexit strategy and will make a statement to MPs at 1230 GMT. Six or more Remain-supporting ministers could quit unless she rules out no-deal in her statement. But one of the PM's closest allies has warned pushing back the 29 March exit would not make getting a deal easier. The BBC's Nick Watt says the feeling is Mrs May will ""lean into"" the rebel ministers' demands and Brexiteers have been told to expect a ""very difficult message"". She has just returned from a summit in Egypt where she held a number of meetings with EU leaders and continued to press for more concessions to placate critics of her deal, in particular on the Irish border backstop. News of the growing unrest within the cabinet came after Labour announced a significant shift in its policy - a decision to back another referendum if its own alternative Brexit plan is rejected. What are the ministers demanding? Mrs May's Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs on 15 January and she has said they'll get a second chance to vote on it - possibly with some changes - by 12 March. But writing in the Daily Mail, ministers Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said Mrs May must promise now that she will rule out the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal if her agreement is rejected again, and instead seek a way to delay. Mr Harrington, a business minister, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that it was ""absolutely absurd"" that, with 31 days to go before the UK is due to leave, a no-deal exit was still a possibility. ""The idea that no deal is a negotiating tool is absolutely incorrect. No-one believes it in the EU. As far as we are concerned the responsible thing is to rule it out."" Unless Mrs May was willing to provide the necessary reassurances, he said he would vote for Parliament to ""take control"" of the process by backing an amendment - a legislative tool - being put before the Commons by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin. If passed, it would give MPs the power to demand a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be agreed by 13 March. He said he was prepared to rebel and quit, if necessary, insisting this would be the ""honourable thing"" to do. ""Warm words alone will not be enough. It has to be a clear undertaking that she is prepared to remove no-deal and have a short extension to Article 50."" Three other senior cabinet ministers, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, have already signalled they could also be prepared to vote for the Cooper-Letwin option if there is no breakthrough in the next few days. How have Tories responded? Mrs May has long resisted any suggestion that the UK's departure from the EU could be postponed beyond 29 March. Leading Tory Brexiteer Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet in November, said those pressuring the PM to rule out no deal should be making their views known in private. Going public showed they were ""losing their nerve"" and ""bottling"" it, she told the BBC. ""These people should not be threatening and going to the papers and weakening her hand. If they are going to go, then just go."" If the UK did leave without a formal agreement on 29 March, she said the UK and EU should enter into what she described as a short ""static period"" where everything remained the same. This, she said, would give both sides the time and space to discuss how trade would operate, such as what, if any tariffs, would apply to imports and exports. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said that calls to avoid a no-deal Brexit by delaying the deadline for leaving the EU did not resolve the issues. ""It ends up simply deferring the need to face up to taking decisions. It's not an actual course of action in its own right,"" he told the BBC. How has Labour's position changed? Labour has said it will support the Cooper-Letwin amendment, making its chances of success far higher. But leader Jeremy Corbyn also wants to use Wednesday to put his own plan for Brexit - which includes a ""comprehensive customs union"" with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - before the Commons. He told his MPs on Monday night that if - as expected - that plan is rejected, the party will formally throw its weight behind another public vote. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that if Labour's Brexit proposals did not get through Parliament ""we, the Labour Party will either put down ourselves, or support an amendment, in favour of a public vote"". That vote, he added, ""ought to be on the option, on the one hand, of a credible leave deal and. on the other hand, remain"".

"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter A long-time fan of the group, he said he had been slow in spotting its effect on GameStop's huge share-price spike in January. ""I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again"", he said. GameStop's share price ended up reaching nearly $500 (£350) before falling. WallStreetBets had been hyping up the computer-game retailer's shares. The idea was if enough Reddit users bought GameStop shares, they could drive up the price, hurting hedge funds who had bet against the company. Some claimed the group had collectively manipulated the market. But Reddit decided to leave it up. ""We were... trying to keep WallStreetBets online,"" Mr Huffman said. When the media talks about the big social-media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - Reddit is often ignored. But as hedge funds learned during the GameStop share-price spike - ignore it at your peril. Reddit likes to think of itself as different. At its heart, it certainly feels more alternative. Its system of upvoting content mean ideas either fly or die. It's not called the front page of the internet for nothing. Mr Huffman has also had to deal with another big story this year - conspiracy theories peddled by Donald Trump about electoral fraud. ""What do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country?"" Mr Huffman said. An influential sub-Reddit called TheDonald was instrumental in hyping up Mr Trump across the internet. Reddit banned it last year. Mr Huffman told BBC News it was the most difficult moderation decision he had had to make. Huffman is one of handful of men in Silicon Valley - along with Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - that make huge decisions on what we can and can't see on the internet. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. When did you first come across WallStreetBets? So I've known about WallStreetBets for years. WallStreetBets is, in fact, one of my guilty pleasures on Reddit. How much was the group about having a laugh? A lot of it, as I think it's the cornerstone to a lot of friendship and human experience. At the end of the day, this community is fun and it's funny. And obviously, there's some cohesion there, talking about the trades. When did you start realising WallStreetBets was having an impact on GameStop's share price? So I think I was actually a little late to this, because I've been on WallStreetBets for a while. And they've been talking about GameStop for a while. And so on WallStreetBets, there's often a couple of stocks or companies or positions that have their attention. And so over the years, it's been Tesla. It's been Virgin Galactic. It's been Blackberry. It's been different things. And so, in my mind, I'm just browsing Reddit and OK, yeah, GameStop's got their infatuation right now. So I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again. And so it was, I think, really at the the take off of the mania when I was like: ""OK, this is a bigger one."" Then there was that crazy period where the GameStop share price went from $20 to $400. What was going through your mind at that point? You know, I love reading business stories. I love reading books about investors and their successes and failures. So it's just a topic I'm interested in. I just thought it was a fascinating story. And it's such a smart thing to do. And I, personally, have found it a fair thing to do. So you were always supportive, like ideologically, of what the group was doing? Yes, because I think if you've got one transaction where one group has taken an extreme position and then another group can see that opportunity that maybe they've overextended themselves. Obviously, there's a lot of risk there. But I think everybody goes in that situation aware of that risk. The shares at one point got almost up to $500 a share. At that point, was there any pressure on you to maybe lock down WallStreetBets? We faced that question, like that literal question: ""Should you do something?"" But our motivation, or what we were trying to do in that situation, was actually the opposite - to keep WallStreetBets online. So you decided: ""This needs to stay up""? The question of should it go down or not was a very fast conversation. And we were, you know, confident that that community was well moderated and well within our content policy. Are you proud of what WallStreetBets managed to achieve? I am always, I think, proud when people do amazing things. And so I think maybe pride isn't even the right word. I think I'm happy or encouraged when humans come together to do something incredible. Do you think that it was a David-and-Goliath story? Oh, absolutely, because, you know, institutional investors have so much. There's so many more resources in terms of knowledge, relationships, the ability to execute large trades. No individual could have done this. Although hedge funds wage war on each other all the time, we never see it. And so to see a group of individuals kind of band together against some really well resourced institutions, I think that's an intriguing story from any angle. Some people lost a lot of money. Do you feel any responsibility? I think any trade, not just risky ones like WallStreetBets, has risk. But it also has opportunity. I think there are two things that are really important. One is that individuals have that opportunity. I don't think we as a society should be so paternal to say that, well: ""This group is smart enough to make these decisions - but this group, you know, we should keep them out,"" because you're not just protecting them from risk, you're eliminating their participation in the gains. Did the Capitol Hill riots make you reappraise the inherent goodness of the free internet? I'd be lying if I say that thought hadn't crossed my mind. But we've seen, I think, on Reddit, the power of people to do, I think, the right thing generally. One of the ways we look at Reddit, one of our duties, is to make sure the volume of any particular viewpoint is in proportion to the number of people who actually have it. And so that is to say we don't want a small number of loud people to have control beyond their numbers. And I think on Reddit we've gotten pretty good at that. I suppose you're wrestling with two things here. You don't want to get involved in censoring or overly censoring people? We feel, I think, there's an enormous responsibility for getting that balance right. And, you know, we are learning, I think, along with everybody else, we do our very best because it's not just the right thing to do for our business - it's the right thing to do for our users. And I think it's the right thing to do generally. And, for example, the QAnon conspiracy theory, we saw that on Reddit and banned it three years ago, long before it metastasized online and in the real world. Do you think you should have done more on TheDonald? That's one of the criticisms of Reddit that comes up a few times. Look, TheDonald was a series of hard decisions. And there's never a hard decision that I don't, upon reflection, wish we had made faster. But I think there's a matter of reality here - the principle of free speech was designed specifically to protect political speech. And so we went through a crisis not just at Reddit but in the United States and, I think, around the world of what do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country. That's a real conflict. And so I think there's no way around that conflict. Is that the most difficult decision that you've had to make? I think it might be, yes, because the other ones were more matters of getting the words right. Other policy changes we've made over the years around, you know, violence or harassment or bullying or involuntary sexualisation, we always knew what our gut told us - what the right thing was. And so those were sometimes complicated because we had to figure out how to get there and how to kind of balance all of our values. But we always knew where we wanted to go. I think with political speech, and in this particular moment, it was particularly challenging given the context of, like, the United States and the president of the United States being almost in conflict with each other. Fake news, conspiracy theories, how do you stay on top of it? Misinformation is another word for propaganda. And propaganda is as old as politics. This is not a new problem. And so, we've faced this problem in different forms over pretty much our entire existence. And so the solution, that we've seen, ultimately lies within people. It lies within a free press. It lies within access to information. It lies within people being allowed to have good judgements and societal pressure to to be truthful, to behave well, all of these things. Finally, there are some pretty niche sub-Reddits. What are the oddest ones you've come across? Oh, my goodness. BreadStapledToTrees is probably the weirdest one that I'm comfortable saying in an interview. And it's as the name implies. It's literally pictures of bread stapled to trees. There's another, I think, favourite around the office, CatStandingUp, which is just pictures of cats standing up. But that one is very strictly moderated. So every comment within every post in that community has to be the single word ""Cat"". Watch The News Explained - GameStop: to the Moon and Back on iPlayer",Reddit boss Steve Huffman has told BBC News he supported the aims of controversial sub-Reddit WallStreetBets.
"Eric Milligan has been a councillor in the city for 40 years. An official inquiry into the project is investigating the delays, cost overruns, redesigns, delivery, governance and management. The Labour councillor, who was lord provost for seven years, said with the benefit of hindsight the scheme should not have gone ahead. The trams were originally designed to run for 15 miles from Edinburgh Airport to Leith by 2011, at a cost of £375m. But a truncated nine-mile service, stopping in the city centre, opened in 2014, at a cost of £776m - with interest charges expected to push the final bill to about £1bn. It was under Labour that proposals for trams were first developed. However it was not until a Lib Dem/SNP coalition from 2007 that the plans began to be executed. The trams project then ran on through 2012 when a Labour/SNP coalition was elected. Mr Milligan was Edinburgh's lord provost between 1996 and 2003. Speaking to Stephen Jardine on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Milligan said: ""If all of us knew then what we know now and how difficult, how expensive and how limited the system is we probably would not have gone ahead. ""It is important that we complete what was intended between the airport and the sea port and we revitalise the waterfront area.""",One of Edinburgh's best known councillors said he wished the city's trams project had never happened.
"The train was heading to an army camp in Cairo when a carriage became detached and crashed into a goods train in the Badrashin area of Giza. Egypt's prime minister visited the scene, but was led to safety after being abused by angry bystanders. Egypt's roads and railways have a notoriously poor safety record. Last November 50 children died when a train hit their school bus near Manfalut, 350km (230 miles) south of Cairo, after a signal operator fell asleep. The transport minister and the head of the railway authority were forced to resign in the wake of the crash. Anger has been directed towards the government for failing to improve railway safety and infrastructure. People at the scene of the latest crash shouted at Prime Minister Hisham Qandil ""You have blood on your hands"", before he was led away by his security guards, AFP news agency reported. Monday's incident occurred as the army train was heading from Upper Egypt into Cairo. Reports say more than 1,300 passengers were aboard the train when it derailed shortly after midnight. An eyewitness, Mohammad Abul-Fadl, told BBC Arabic many victims were trapped. ""Ambulances didn't arrive for half an hour. There were bodies everywhere,"" he said. ""An hour and a half later and the railway authority [had not] sent any lifting equipment. Local people tried to help. They've even brought in a loader from the local authority to bring out some of the trapped victims, who were still alive, from under the wreckage. The latest incident could increase the pressure on the government to tackle the safety of trains, the BBC's Said Shehata reports from Cairo. Four years ago, some 18 people were killed and dozens injured in a collision between two passenger trains in the Giza area. And in 2002, a train caught fire in Cairo, killing 373 people.","A military train carrying army recruits has derailed south of Egypt's capital, Cairo, killing 19 people and injuring more than 100, officials say."
"The facility at the National Sports Centre (NSC) in Douglas was closed in August 2018 for a £4.2m refurbishment. Sports Minister Graham Cregeen said the delay had been ""disappointing"". He added that the centre's leisure pool, which has faced ""significant issues"" over the installation of water slides, would reopen ""as soon as possible"". The Isle of Man's national swimming coach Lee Holland previously said the length of the closure had led to a fall in participation in the sport, while Ramsey commissioner Juan McGuinness said it had caused a ""massive"" increase in use of regional facilities in the north, west and south of the island. Mr Cregeen said that while the delays were ""disappointing"", the ""significant project"" had seen ""essential refurbishments"" carried out on the complex.","The Isle of Man's main swimming pool has reopened, nearly three months later than planned."
"John Bradbury said the ""quite frisky"" mammal was spotted lying on the sand at Knott End, near Fleetwood in Lancashire, at about 10:00 GMT. After covering it with wet blankets, coastguards used a miniature stretcher to get it back into the water, he said. He said that everybody involved in the rescue was ""happy it went off"". 'Caught out' Mr Bradbury said once the dolphin was back in the water, it ""kept going to the shore and out again"" for about an hour, ""getting bolder and bolder"", before it ""just swam off to sea"". Referring to the 1993 film in which an orca is released into the sea, he said once it ""decided it was going, we gave it the option [and] it seemed to be like Free Willy"". A spokeswoman for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, who were involved in the rescue, said it was likely to have been a young striped dolphin. She said there was ""usually a reason for them coming ashore"" and it was possible it was ill, but that ""in this area, the tide does go out quite quickly and it's possible it was just been caught out"". She added that members of the public should ""never handle stricken dolphins because they can carry disease"".","A dolphin which was washed up on a beach has been rescued and stretchered back to the sea ""like Free Willy"", a coastguard has said."
"It has been operating a pay and display system since last year, and on Wednesday, members of a scrutiny committee voted to continue charging but with a number of amendments. Flintshire council said the parking fees would help protect services threatened by budget cuts. Its cabinet will now be asked to endorse the decision on 21 June. ""Pay and display is here to stay in Flintshire,"" said cabinet member Bernie Attridge, adding that it was important to collect and listen to feedback so they could improve the experience of car park users. He said the tariffs people paid were not only used to maintain and improve car parking facilities, but helped ""protect other vital services, such as social services and education, which are under threat from continued budget reductions.""",Flintshire council has agreed to push ahead with permanent charging for car parks in its town centres.
"The first minister was speaking after a meeting between senior ministers from the NI Executive and Irish government. Two primary schools have said they will close voluntarily, the first primary schools in NI to do so. The two are Lurgan Model Primary School, in County Armagh, and St Scire's in Trillick, County Tyrone. Lurgan Model said it would close for the week, while St Scire's will close on Monday ahead of planned St Patrick's closures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Five new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in NI while a second person has died in the Republic of Ireland. There have been 129 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland while coronavirus deaths have doubled in 24 hours in the UK. The first and deputy first ministers met counterparts include Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar in Armagh on Saturday. Speaking after the meeting, Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill were both still split over the issue of school closures. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill repeated her call for them to be shut immediately, in line with the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile, in a statement on social media, Lurgan Model Primary School said it remain closed all this week. The school said it was already due to be shut on Monday and Tuesday due to St Patrick's Day and will bring planned closures due for May forward to this week. It is the first school in Northern Ireland to close voluntarily over the outbreak. The school said it ""will not officially reopen until Monday, 23 March"" but will ""monitor the situation of this incoming week"". St Scire's, in Trillick, said the school would stay closed on Monday ahead of planned closures on Tuesday and Wednesday for St Patrick's Day. It added that the situation will be reviewed prior to Thursday. Ministers still divided over schools Speaking after the meeting in Armagh, Mrs Foster said that schools will close ""when we are advised on the medical evidence"". ""Children will be at home for quite a considerable period of time, given that when we do close the schools they will be closed for at least 16 weeks. ""Then of course you are into the summer period, so they will be off school for a very long time."" Ms O'Neill said all parties in the executive agreed schools would have to close but it was a matter of timing. She said: ""In my opinion schools should close now. I think we need to be consistent across this island ""I think the fact that you can have two schools a mile apart and one school's open and one school's closed that's a very confusing picture and a very confusing message for the public."" Ms O'Neill first called for schools to close immediately on Friday, a day after she, along with First Minister Arlene Foster, said the executive did not believe the situation had reached that stage. On Saturday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for schools to close, after Archibishop Eamon Martin, the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, wrote to NI's education minister to ask him to consider closures. Taoiseach explains closures short notice However, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the main differences between the two governments was over timing. He said the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish government shared the same objective in slowing the advance of coronavirus but it was inevitable there would be differences in how they approached it. He added: ""But the differences that exist are mostly around timing. ""What there isn't any difference about is our common objective, which is to slow down this virus in its tracks and push it back as much as possible and limit the harm to human health and human life."" Mrs Foster said both governments had ""very coherent messages"". Mr Varadkar also explained that the short notice of Irish school closures given to counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK was ""not how we intended it to happen"". ""I absolutely guarantee you I did not intend to make that announcement or speak to Irish people on the steps of Blair House in Washington DC,"" he said. ""We had a plan in place to move to delay phase. We had to bring that forward almost overnight."" He added that Irish officials gave ""as many people a heads up as we could, including authorities here in Northern Ireland"" but it was also ""important that the Irish people should hear the news first from me and from the government"". ""That's why the notice that we gave people here and elsewhere was so short but there was no perfect way of doing this unfortunately and I appreciate the understanding of the first minister and deputy first minister,"" he added. Health Minister Robin Swann, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney and Irish Health Minister Simon Harris also attended the meeting. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald - who was not at the meeting - said the UK's response to coronavirus ""should be rejected"" and is ""totally unacceptable in the north of Ireland"".","When schools shut in Northern Ireland over coronavirus it will be for at least 16 weeks, Arlene Foster has said."
"Prince William and his new wife will extend the trip with a three-day visit to California from 8-10 July, said their spokesman. Announcing the visit on its Twitter page, Clarence House said a full itinerary would be published later. It will be the first official visit to the US for the duke. While the prince has previously visited the States in a private capacity, this will be the duchess's first trip to the country. The prince returned to his job as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot this week after marrying the duchess on Friday at Westminster Abbey. The couple spent their first weekend as a married couple at a secret location in the UK, and opted to postpone their honeymoon until a later date. They will begin their first joint official overseas trip by touring Canada from 30 June to 8 July, including visits to Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the capital, Ottawa. Speaking earlier this year Canadian PM Stephen Harper said it was a testament to Canada's ""very close relationship with the Royal Family"". It is believed the couple will take part in Canada Day celebrations in Ottawa on 1 July.

"Allegra StrattonPolitical editor, BBC Newsnight@BBCAllegraon Twitter The funds will come from house developers paying a levy when they are granted planning permission. The plan is the latest push to reduce opposition to house building. But house developers are concerned it could make land more expensive and affect affordable homes. Mr Boles explains the incentive could see groups such as parish councils and residents groups up and down the country receive hundreds of thousands of pounds should they support proposals for more house building. He jokingly refers to the policy as ""bribes"" and ""Boles' bungs"" and suggests communities might use the funds to build a new swimming pool or village hall. On Newsnight Mr Boles says that the failure to increase the rate of house building is, in his opinion, ""the biggest social justice crisis we have"". ""It is a huge national crisis. For my money I think it is the biggest social justice crisis we have,"" he says. ""It is bigger than bad schools - though we have plenty of bad schools - and it is bigger than people without jobs -though we have lots of people without jobs."" Mr Boles says the housing problem lies at the root of many other problems because if people are unable to get houses they cannot bring their children up well or move to an area with jobs. ""We completely understand the situation, that's why we want to try and support some of this stuff,"" he says. Incentivising communities His policy revolves around this government's innovation of neighbourhood plans - groups of residents, villages, parish councils, interest groups set up to shape planning decisions in a given area but whatever mix, all designated by a local authority. The new money will flow to those communities who have neighbourhood plans, but in cities where there are no parish councils and where neighbourhood plans have been designated by local authorities by different criteria, the money will be allocated to the district council to be spent only on the direction of the group behind the neighbourhood plan. In areas with no constitutional status, officials told BBC Newsnight the local council would hold the funds on behalf of the neighbourhood group and wait for a stipulation on how that neighbourhood would like the funds to be spent. The funds are to be provided by house developers who pay a tax - the community infrastructure levy (CIL) - when they are given planning permission. In total, Mr Boles says the Treasury has estimated this levy could bring in a total of £1bn. Not all councils will charge the CIL, but the government expects that they will all move towards it otherwise they will not be asking developers to help them meet the expense of an increase in infrastructure costs in any given area. This government and the previous Labour government believed this necessary to reflect the fact that developers have seen an increased price of land with newly granted planning permission, and that developers must help a community with extra infrastructure to deal with the increased numbers of inhabitants. Though the policy was developed by the Labour government, government officials said they had yet to set out how the revenue from the levy should be spent. In order to assuage local communities opposing developments, the government is announcing that local communities who get involved in neighbourhood plans - and whose community puts them to a vote - will be given 25% of the CIL to spend on infrastructure of their choosing. Those groups where there is no neighbourhood plan and no referendum on the plan, will also receive 15% when planning permission for a development is approved. Officials have told BBC Newsnight that the plans could see communities finding themselves in direct receipt of anywhere between £236,500 and £652,500 of funds depending on the number of new properties they accept. The sole proviso is the new money is spent on infrastructure from an approved list. Because the levy is calculated based on the rates payable in any given area, the higher figure of £652,500 would be an outlier - central London or another high value area. Officials said £200,000 to £300,000 ""would be a very reasonable expectation for average neighbourhoods"". The (CIL) was proposed in 2008 by the previous government and legislated for by the coalition in their first weeks in power in 2010. Having criticised it, the coalition decided to adopt it and on Wednesday are announcing they will significantly scale it up. For the past two and a half years of government ministers have resisted setting out who would receive this money and some in government had fought for the monies to go to direct to national infrastructure programme. It had been expected the council or local authority would be given it, to pay for the increased amenities required in the area of increased building but now ministers are insisting 25% is put directly into the hands of local people and not all given to the council or local authority to spend. Mr Boles caused controversy last month when in his first interview since becoming the minister for planning, he said that green field sites would have to be built on if Britain was going to meet the demand for housing. He said he believed part of the opposition to housing was driven by a dislike of the designs of the new builds which he called ""pig ugly"". If design could be improved, opposition might reduce. Previously, under the legal requirement of ""section 106"", developers had to make a contribution to local infrastructure to help it cope with the new burdens placed on it by an influx of new dwellings. However these had to be negotiated on an individual basis and were cumbersome. Local people were not in charge of what it was spent on. Housing developers have expressed concerns about the imminent implementation of the CIL, saying it could actually end up making land more expensive. When costs go up, they predict, the element of house building that ends up suffering are those less expensive affordable homes.

"During a safety campaign on the issue, West Midlands Police officers have posed as cyclists to catch drivers. Dean Littleford, 60, from Birmingham, denied driving without due care and attention in Park Lane West, Tipton, in November. But he was fined £1,038 and had five points added to his licence by Dudley Magistrates' Court. Almost 200 offenders have been stopped by police as part of the GiveSpaceBeSafe scheme, which was launched in September, with 13 going on to be prosecuted. PC Mark Hodson from the Central Motorway Police Group said: ""Most offenders watch the footage, accept their driving was below par, and elect for a driver improvement course or an offer of three licence points and £100. ""This was a clear case of a close-pass - the cyclist was nearly forced into the kerb and the actions of the truck driver could easily have caused a very serious collision. ""He maintained his innocence, though, and has now been convicted in court."" Police want drivers overtaking cyclists ""to be patient, plan your overtake, and give plenty of room"". The Highway Code states drivers should give the same room as when overtaking another vehicle which is about 1.5m or an open car door's width. The force said reports of ""close passes"" have halved since the operation was introduced. The 56-year-old Wednesbury cyclist involved in this case said he felt the scheme ""gives cyclists the confidence and reassurance that such dangerous driving will not be tolerated"".",A lorry driver has become one of the first UK motorists to be fined for driving too close to a cyclist.
"Users of the separate Messenger app have more than doubled from 200 million in April, the company said. Facebook had faced a backlash after it announced it would be forcing users to download the app to send private messages to friends over the main Facebook service. Users started being pushed to download the app - launched in 2011 - in July. ""Messaging is an important part of how people stay connected and since Messenger launched in 2011 we've been passionate about giving people a faster and more expressive way to communicate,"" said Facebook's director of product management Peter Martinazzi in a blog on Thursday. Facing criticism In April, Facebook had told users that they would need to download a separate app to allow them to send videos, make free calls and chat with friends. But, the tech giant was widely criticised by users that did not like the concept of leaving the Facebook website to another service to send messages. That led to the iOS App Store review score for the recent version of the Messenger app to fall to one and half stars. ""Messenger was the first of our standalone apps, and unlike our core Facebook apps, it focused on one use case - messaging,"" Mr Martinazzi said. ""We've also continued to improve speed and reliability. Updates to Messenger ship every two weeks so it continues to evolve and improve,"" he added, indicating that Facebook plans to stick with the app despite the negative feedback. Last week Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that forcing people to install another app was ""a short term painful thing"", but added that the benefit was that his firm could offer a ""faster and more focused"" experience. One company watcher suggested that Facebook should be cautious about risks of creating too many separate apps. ""Facebook's key strategy is keeping people engaged within its world - whether it's the Messenger app or the core Facebook app,"" said Jack Kent, senior mobile analyst at the IHS Technology consultancy. ""It probably wouldn't want to go down the road of having a huge variety of separate apps, but if there is a clear and distinct difference in functionality, then having a standalone app does make sense."" Meanwhile, Facebook has been trying to get on the forefront of mobile messaging, and finalised a deal to buy popular messaging service WhatsApp last month for about $22bn (£13.8bn). The mobile messaging app had more than 600 million monthly users at the time of the acquisition.",Social networking giant Facebook said its new messaging service now has more than 500 million users worldwide.
"By Steve RosenbergBBC News, Moscow It was the summer of 1942 and Winston Churchill had flown to Russia to cement his wartime alliance with Joseph Stalin. ""We will continue hand in hand like comrades and brothers,"" Churchill declared on arrival, ""until every vestige of the Nazi regime has been beaten into the ground."" Talk like this gave BBC bosses an idea. If Blighty and the Bolsheviks were suddenly best buddies, perhaps now was the moment to have a BBC correspondent based full-time in Moscow? So they sounded out the Soviets. And the answer came back: ""Nyet!"" A memo from the Assistant Controller of News written at the time reads: ""The DG and editor-in-chief went to see the Soviet ambassador the other day and got no change at all. The Ambassador was extremely chilly. DG was left with the impression that nothing is likely to come of it."" Mind you, it wasn't only Stalin who poured cold water on the idea. ""I think all Moscow cover is a waste of time and money,"" argued the BBC Central European Correspondent. It was his job to report on Russia from the safety, and coffee-shop comfort of Vienna. In 1961 he tried to knock the whole idea on the head in a memo to his editor: ""It is impossible in the USSR to get either official or unofficial reaction to anything except through the pages of the press the next day. Though this is often forgotten in London where it is naturally assumed correspondents will be able to go and talk to the renowned man-in-the-street. They can't. The opportunities for being a journalist are very slight indeed and to an experienced man this is very annoying."" But when Soviet censorship eased under Nikita Khrushchev, the temptation to establish a permanent presence behind the iron curtain became irresistible and in 1963 the BBC finally opened a Moscow bureau. Erik de Mauny was the obvious choice for the BBC's first resident correspondent in the USSR. Not only did he have plenty of foreign reporting experience (previous postings included Vienna, Beirut and Washington), he also had a university degree in Russian. The BBC bought him a car, a dark green Humber Super Snipe, which had been specially adapted to cope with the cold. And to keep himself warm, the intrepid reporter had brought with him two key items - an ankle-length suede coat from Moss Bros and a pair of RAF flying boots. De Mauny wrote about his Moscow experiences in a book, Shouting Through the Static. Sadly, he died before it could be published. The manuscript reads like the screenplay for a James Bond film. Particularly the account of a scoop with a spook - his exclusive interview in 1964 with the spy, Kim Philby. The two men spent six hours in Philby's hotel suite getting drunk on vodka, wine and Armenian cognac, while Philby's KGB minder waited patiently in the corridor. Then de Mauny had a tough decision to make. I woke at 09:00 next morning with throbbing temples and with a realisation that I was in a dilemma. Should I send a news despatch to London about my meeting with Kim? What was more, should I mention it to any of my close colleagues? I knew I had a scoop, if I chose to play it that way, because apart from one brief sighting by a Reuters' correspondent some months earlier, no-one had tracked Kim down, still less talked to him at length as I had done. Nevertheless, I decided to wait. A news despatch would certainly make an impact, but it was highly likely to prove a nine-days wonder. I seemed to me sensible to keep my powder dry and wait to see whether my encounter with Kim might yield long-term benefits. After careful thought, however, I decided that the Embassy ought to be informed. So a bit later that morning, my hangover having subsided, I drove down to the big pseudo-Gothic mansion on the river embankment opposite the Kremlin. I found the Minister, Tom Brimelow, in his office and while we made small talk I slipped him a piece of paper on which I'd written: ""I saw Kim Philby last night. Thought you might like to know about it."" Tom contemplated this without emotion, but a few moments later he said, ""That reminds me - I must have a word with the ambassador. I shan't be long."" He was back a moment or two later with the ambassador, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, who gave me a brief nod. Then, with Tom leading, we made our way in silence down to the Embassy ""safe room"", a small basement room enclosed in an electronic shield in which one could talk without fear of being bugged... A day or so later, as I was crossing the courtyard (at home), I was intercepted by one of the first secretaries from the embassy, who handed me a folded piece of paper. ""From the ambassador,"" he said, adding in a low voice, ""better put it down the loo when you've read it."" I opened the paper and saw that it contained a single typewritten sentence: ""London advises break off contact."" In my role as Moscow correspondent I have never had to scribble secret notes to embassy officials or participate in drinking sessions with secret agents. And yet, 50 years on, Moscow correspondents are still chasing spy stories. After all, espionage didn't end when the Cold War did. Like most foreign journalists in Moscow at the time, De Mauny assumed that his apartment was bugged. As frustrating as that may have been for his family, this created comical situations. During a visit to Moscow by the BBC's director general, Hugh Greene, and the head of BBC foreign liaison, Donald Stephenson, the correspondent invited his bosses - and British ambassador Sir Humphrey Trevelyan - back to his flat for a drink. Suddenly, Donald caught my eye. ""I say, old boy, there's one thing I've been meaning to ask,"" he said. ""Is it true that Mrs Furtseva is Khrushchev's mistress?"" Before I could utter a word, Sir Humphrey had cut in. ""Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture,"" he said firmly. ""Yes, I know,"" said Donald, not to be put off, ""but is she Khrushchev's mistress?"" The ambassador directed his gaze at the ceiling, and, this time in loud, decisive tones, once more declared: ""Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture!"" I saw Donald open his mouth, as if to make a further try. Then, fortunately, the penny dropped. There was a moment of embarrassed silence, and we turned to other topics. It was from the Central Telegraph Office on Gorky Street that Erik de Mauny filed many of his stories. This sprawling construction was the communications hub of the Soviet Union - people came here to send telegrams, telexes, letters and to make long-distance calls. De Mauny would often book telephone lines to London hours in advance. At the allotted time he would turn up, go into a booth and voice his despatch. At least, that was the theory. But sometimes the lines never came up. This happened so often that de Mauny even wrote to the Soviet communications minister to complain. Since then, of course, technology has moved on. Today the Moscow correspondent can use his smart phone to broadcast live radio in quality, even to transmit TV pictures. As for the Central Telegraph, you can still send telegrams from there. But all those old Soviet telephone booths have been ripped out and replaced by a bank and a cafe. I checked out the cafe. The food is adequate, but not as exotic as some of the delicacies de Mauny was treated to in the 1960s. All foreign correspondents and the entire diplomatic corp based in Moscow would get invited to lavish banquets at the Kremlin. De Mauny interpreted it as an attempt by Khrushchev to impress the outside world: The chosen guests and members of the politburo were grouped behind the top table, while the rest of us circulated between the two long side tables. All three tables were lavishly laden with the most succulent dishes imaginable, from mounds of the finest Iranian caviar from the southern Caspian - plump globules of grey imperial malosol in crystal dishes surrounded by crushed ice - to great platters of smoked salmon and sturgeon... Meanwhile, waiters hurried among the guests with trays of delicious hot snacks, ice-cream and champagne, coffee and Armenian cognac. The Moscow correspondent today has fewer opportunities to dine in such decadence at the heart of Russian power. But, on the positive side, he has far more options for eating out than de Mauny ever did - today Moscow is awash with cafes, coffee shops and restaurants. The supermarkets are better stocked, too, and many of them are open round the clock. The Soviet concept of ""defitsit"" or ""shortage"" has, thankfully, passed into history. Erik de Mauny spent three years in Moscow. During that time he covered such momentous events as the first woman cosmonaut in space and Nikita Khrushchev's fall from power. In 1966 he left Moscow and moved to the BBC's Paris bureau. But six years later he was back in the USSR for a second stint. In 1974 he reported the arrest of the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Only hours before, de Mauny had recorded Solzhenitsyn reading from his book, Gulag Archipelago. Now he needed to get that tape to London, fast. And it was de Mauny's wife Elizabeth, a fellow journalist, who came up with an ingenious solution. In a souvenir shop she bought a cassette recording of the Red Army choir. She took out the tape and put the Solzhenitsyn recording in its place. Then a family friend who was returning to London smuggled it out. Collectively they had beaten the system - with a little help from the Soviet military's finest voices. Having read de Mauny's memoirs, I'm struck both by what has changed in Russia over the last 50 years and by what hasn't. As a foreign correspondent based in Moscow, Erik de Mauny wasn't allowed to travel more than a few miles out of the Soviet capital without permission from the Soviet authorities. I have much more freedom to move around, although even today some parts of the country are still off-limits to me. And yet today, just like in 1963, dealing with officialdom can be problematic. I sense that many officials continue to view Western journalists with deep suspicion. De Mauny wrote that there were ""so many contradictions between the warmth and generosity of individual friends and the sheer heartlessness of the system"". That rings true now today. Russians who don't fit in with ""the system"" or who openly criticise it run the risk of being identified as troublemakers, even enemies of Russia. But there is one story in Russia today which I'm certain Erik de Mauny would have gained great pleasure and pride from telling. And it's 700 miles east of Moscow. I fly to the city of Perm in the Ural Mountains and attend a rehearsal at the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre. This is one of the oldest and most successful musical theatres in Russia. And the general manager and executive producer here is Marc de Mauny, the son of the BBC's first Moscow correspondent. Marc was just three when his father's second posting to Moscow ended in 1974. But, years later, he would return to study music at the St Petersburg Conservatory. He became fascinated by Russia, just like his father. ""My father loved Russian culture, literature and music, and I think, unwittingly, he passed that on to me,"" Marc says. ""I didn't wake up to that until I was 16 or 17 and wondering where to go for my gap year and what to study at university. And it came to me in a blinding flash that I'd like to study Russian and travel in Russia and discover this country which I'd heard so much about from my father. But I had grown up with Russia and the Soviet Union very much present as this vast, mysterious land. It was an emotional involvement. Russia is an emotional place."" In a tiny practice room, spellbound, I watch a soloist putting heart and soul into a piece from Madame Butterfly. And I have to agree - Russia is an emotional place. This is a country of big hearts, great talents. But also huge problems and deep disappointments. Russia is beauty and beast. For the Moscow correspondent the challenge was, and always will be, to paint a complete picture.

"Recent events on the small island of Cyprus were always going to have a large impact, but I doubt if anyone suspected the effect would be to boost the growth of a new kind of money. When the new Cypriot president announced in mid-March of this year that the bailout of the country's banks would be funded by seizing a percentage from the accounts of all depositors, there was an outcry. The Cypriot parliament refused to support the policy, which was withdrawn and replaced by a levy on substantial deposits, limits on withdrawals and controls on capital leaving the country. European officials dismissed suggestions that seizing the assets of depositors would be any part of future bailouts. But the damage had been done. Within days of the Cypriot president's announcement, the price of the digital currency Bitcoin began a rapid rise. Fleeing banks and the risk of governments seizing savings, people were switching into a currency that exists only in cyberspace. Cyber money of this kind has a powerful appeal. Traditional currencies such as the pound, the dollar and the euro are issued by central banks and - with the exception of the euro - each of them is backed by a national government. This may seem an advantage but nowadays currencies that are created and ultimately controlled by governments are less trusted than they used to be. While the policies that were adopted in the wake of the financial crash may have saved the world from a rerun of the 1930s, they also mean that money is steadily losing its value as a store of wealth. With near-zero interest rates, small savers are robbed as surely as they would have been if the original Cypriot plan had been implemented, just more slowly. Some try to find shelter in the stock market, but shares have not always given protection against rising prices, and many people can't afford to put their capital at risk in this way. Some seek safety in gold, which functions more like a currency than a commodity and has the advantage of being a finite resource that cannot be created out of nothing like paper currencies. But while gold cannot be printed by governments, it has in practice been closely controlled by them. It has even been claimed that the price of gold has been manipulated, with some suggesting the current sell-off has been somehow orchestrated - an idea that may be mistaken but doesn't seem quite so outlandish now that we know lending rates between banks were for a time rigged on an enormous scale. If you mistrust the financial system, it's not obvious that gold can offer a way out. This is where Bitcoin - which some of its supporters describe as digital gold - comes in. First devised and launched in 2009 by a mysterious figure going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, the cyber-currency is set up to be independent of monetary authorities and banks. Using publicly available software that operates via a network of about 20,000 powerful computers, units of the cyber-currency are created by the application of a mathematical formula in a process known as ""bitcoin mining"". An upper limit of units is built into the software. Unlike currencies controlled by governments, which can be issued in unlimited quantities, only about 21 million bitcoins can ever be mined. This means they can't lose value by inflation as all forms of paper money have done over time. Just as important, Bitcoin users needn't entrust their money to banks which will lend it out to others - at times recklessly. Equipped with cryptographic features that promise anonymity, this is a kind of money that seems immune to loss. The appeal of Bitcoin comes from the belief that it enables those who use it to step outside the shaky structures of global finance. But is this faith well-founded? The currency has been criticised as a tool of speculators and money-laundering and its value has oscillated wildly as a result of hacking. Some have condemned it as a Ponzi scheme or a speculative bubble, like the mania for tulip bulbs that raged for a few years in 17th Century Holland. Others have pointed out that since the supply cannot be increased beyond a predetermined point, Bitcoin could be more deflationary in its effects than gold. If it's successful, the currency will be hoarded and become more valuable than productive economic assets. Yet if these are some of Bitcoin's limitations, they are not the most fundamental. The true flaw of this and any other virtual currency is that it cannot deliver its users from the hazards and conflicts of the real human world. The emergence of Bitcoin confirms that money need not be created by government. Anything people come to view as money can serve some of money's functions without any governmental authorisation. Cigarettes are widely used in prisons as a medium of exchange, and paper currencies have been accepted as money even when they no longer had government backing. After the first Gulf War in 1991, dinars that had been withdrawn by the government of Saddam Hussein were used in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Called ""Swiss dinars"" because they were printed with plates from Switzerland, this illicit currency was soon worth far more than the government-backed dinars Saddam was printing in vast quantities. Swiss dinars remained in use until a new national currency was established following the American-led invasion of 2003 in which Saddam was overthrown. A virtual currency such as Bitcoin attracts users because it's not subject to any government. At the same time, it needs a margin of freedom in which to operate, and this freedom will be at risk if the financial crisis worsens. When these crises threaten to get out of hand, governments have a habit of confiscating not only the bank accounts but also the freedoms of their citizens. We're unlikely to see anything like the dictatorships that emerged from the chaos of the 1930s but it's entirely possible that democratic governments will feel the need for controls of the kind that European officials have imposed in Cyprus. Bitcoin's users believe it can give them protection against such incursions. But governments today have formidable tools of electronic surveillance at their disposal, and it would be unwise to assume that virtual currencies are beyond their reach. Bitcoin embodies a kind of cyber-anarchism; the idea that the decentralised networks of the internet will enable the ideal of freedom from government, which has eluded so many revolutionaries in the past, to be finally realised. It's a philosophy that shares the fatal illusion of anarchism in all its varieties, the notion that most human beings actually want freedom from government. Invading personal freedom in times of crisis isn't always unpopular - far from it. Not only during the 20th Century but throughout history, human beings have turned to governments, and often to tyrants, for protection and security. The safety they are looking for may be just a mirage. That hasn't stopped them wanting it. Believers in Bitcoin are confident that it can protect them not just from governments but also against humankind as a whole. Instead of relying on politicians and bankers, or the vagaries of democracy, Bitcoin's users put their faith in the laws of mathematics. For them the cyber-currency is governed by an incorruptible formula that - like the eternal forms envisioned by Plato, immaterial abstract ideas standing outside of time - is untouched by human error and folly. The trouble is that unlike the tranquil spiritual ether imagined by the ancient Greek mystic, cyber-space is all too clearly a human artefact. A site of unceasing warfare - abounding in worms and viruses, vulnerable to attack and decay, and needing scarce resources and energy to operate - the virtual realm of the internet is a projection of the human world with all its conflicts. A virtual currency can't escape the dangers of actual societies. Cyber money may have many practical uses and provide an alternative to banks. It can't be a way out from history's intractable dilemmas. How Bitcoin will develop cannot be known. Quite possibly it will crash and fail, be supplanted by rival virtual currencies or else shut down by governments because it is succeeding too well. Whatever happens, this will surely not be the last attempt to find freedom in cyberspace. While the freedom Bitcoin promises is an illusion, it's one that will always have a grip on the human mind - the dream of finding some kind of talisman, a benevolent tyrant or a magical new technology, that can shelter us from power and crime and protect us from each other.

"By Joshua CheethamBusiness reporter, BBC News Goop's pop-up store in Notting Hill, west London, opens on Tuesday until late January. Its online store is also available to European customers for the first time in its 10-year history. Goop has been criticised by doctors and scientists who allege that it uses pseudo-science to peddle products. What is Goop? Goop began in September 2008 as a newsletter produced by Paltrow for her friends. It has since grown into an lifestyle and beauty business reportedly worth £190m ($250m), with a website, online store, pop-up shops, a magazine and a series of so-called ""wellness summits"". The website has content on beauty, food, fashion and travel, and sells a range of health-related products along with make-up, jewellery, clothing, bags and even sex toys. Paltrow is part of a long list of celebrities with businesses in health, fitness and fashion, including actress Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Beyonce's 22 Days Nutrition. Have there been controversies? Gwyneth Paltrow has increasingly come under scrutiny from scientists and doctors who say she uses pseudoscience to sell products. Following a lawsuit earlier this year, the website was forced to pay $145,000 (£112,000) for making unscientific claims about vaginal ""eggs"". Goop claimed the eggs, which are made from jade and rose quartz and can be inserted into the vagina, could balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles. The company said it had not received any complaints about those claims. ""It's important to hold companies accountable for unsubstantiated claims, especially when the claims have the potential to affect women's health,"" said Tony Rackauckas, the Orange County District Attorney who led the legal action. Goop has also attracted controversy for promoting coffee enema machines and for recommending women steam-clean their vaginas to rebalance hormones and clean their uteruses. Recently, Paltrow revealed that plans to create a magazine in partnership with Conde Nast fell apart after the publisher insisted on fact-checking Goop articles. The magazine closed after two issues were published online. ""They're a company that's really in transition and do things in a very old-school way,"" she told the New York Times. ""We realised we could just do a better job of it ourselves in-house."" Goop has since hired a lawyer to vet all claims on its website, and recruited an editor from Conde Nast to run its magazine. Will the new store boost Goop? While some retailers are finding trading difficult, Goop joins other online businesses such as Amazon in opening bricks and mortar stores. ""A lot of the online retailers will do this more and more, because rather than have a permanent physical store open just the once, a pop up becomes an event,"" says retail expert Clare Bailey. ""It's a great way to acquire customers who wouldn't buy from an online store but want to see products and have a chat about them, and to build customer loyalty."" What is the London store like? Shoppers are greeted by a series of olive trees - some of the many flowers, trees and herbs nestled around the shop's four floors. Goop designed the ""California-inspired"" store with London-based interior designer Fran Hickman. Its minimalistic white walls, wooden set-pieces, potted plants and pastel hues lend a sense of calm. Walk around and you'll spot racks of clothing, jewellery and books on health and wellbeing written by owner Gwyneth Paltrow. There's also a range of homewares on offer as well as an array of health and beauty products including Goop's own skincare range, which it says are made from ""organic ingredients"".",The controversial lifestyle brand founded by Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow has opened its first UK store.
"Mr Sargeant's family had sought a judicial review into the process of the investigation, led by Paul Bowen QC. First Minister Carwyn Jones sacked Mr Sargeant from the Welsh Government last year after claims of sexual harassment. The former AM for Alyn and Deeside was found dead at his home days after he was fired. His family had wanted their lawyers to be able to cross-examine witnesses as part of the process. The legal move had led to the investigation's proceedings being suspended. An inquest heard the provisional cause of Mr Sargeant's death was hanging. 'No grounds' In dismissing the request for permission to apply for judicial review, Mrs Justice Farbey said there were ""adequate provisions for the claimant to put questions through the investigator and/or his counsel."" ""There are no grounds for supposing that the investigator will not apply those provisions fairly,"" she wrote. The family had argued that the investigator Mr Bowen had failed to ""consult the claimant about procedural matters"". But Mrs Farbey said this was ""unsustainable on the evidence"". ""Not least, the claimant selected the investigator."" She said there was no principle that evidence in an inquiry should be heard in public, and that the Welsh Government had given ""sound reasons for requiring evidence to be heard in private"". A spokeswoman for Hudgell Solicitors said: ""We have received confirmation from the High Court that our application for permission to apply for Judicial Review has been refused and are currently discussing the position with our client and counsel."" The Welsh Government, which commissioned the investigation, said: ""The claimants now have seven days to apply for a reconsideration of this decision. The timings of the independent inquiry are a matter for Mr Bowen QC.""",A legal challenge against the format of a probe into the sacking of the late minister Carl Sargeant has been refused by the High Court.
"By Michael StephensDeputy director, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) Qatar It is well documented now that Isis is comprised of individuals who have successfully merged religion, politics, and military expertise to form a potent force that has swept away fleeing Iraqi soldiers, and executed those who are foolish enough to stay behind. These methods, in combination with Isis' implementation of Sharia (Islamic law) including bizarre acts such as cutting electricity to prevent people from watching television, have given the group a fearsome reputation. Isis as a vehicle Furthermore, Isis has inspired extremists of all stripes to join its operations in Syria and Iraq through a social media and mass propaganda campaign that hints at its jihadist goals. But the extent to which the movement actually contains hardline committed jihadists is extremely difficult to ascertain. It is fair to say, however, that the true size of the jihadist element in the Isis operations in Iraq is far smaller than many suppose. Indeed, as in Syria, it is often the case that many individuals in extremist movements use them as a vehicle for their own interests, adopting the garb and mannerism of a committed Islamic radical as a pathway to greater political goals. The case of Iraq is no different. Joining the jihad are an amorphous bloc of different players, who have come together in an alliance under the banner of Isis. Whilst the instability in Iraq has connections to the Syrian conflict next door, and many individuals who fought for Isis in Syria are now present in Iraq, the Iraqi insurgency is more acutely focused on solving the problems of Iraq's fractured polity than it is the goals of more radical Islamic groups. In a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, member of the Batta tribe and leader of the Islamic Army of Iraq Sheikh Ahmad al Dabash stated: ""All the Sunni tribes have come out against (Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri) Maliki. ""There are parts of the military, Baathists from the time of Saddam Hussein, clerics, everyone (who) came out for the oppression that we have been suffering,"" he added. Widespread disaffection To dismiss what is happening in Iraq as the product of the maniacal whims of a few radical fanatics is to ignore the very real social inequality that exists in Iraq. Travelling around the country in recent days, I have been shocked at the levels of deprivation that some of Iraq's citizens have endured. The grouping of fighters that has swept through Iraq to within 60km (40 miles) of the capital is not a nihilistic jihadist group hell bent on the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. It is a more general uprising by large groupings of disaffected communities throughout north-western Iraq and a product of years of social exclusion, poor governance and corruption by the Iraqi government. On the military front, the key giveaway is the relatively strong performance of Isis militants against more established military forces. Officials I have spoken to in the Kurdish Peshmerga forces have indicated that the level of training is high and that their own forces have at times struggled to hold key positions around the city of Kirkuk. ""For the most part we've been able to hold our positions, but it hasn't been easy. They [Isis] are well armed and well trained,"" one Kurdish security official told me on Tuesday. Tentative alliance Such performances are consistent with the assertion that key former Baathist military officers are coordinating Isis military operations, which was confirmed in my conversations with security officials in Kirkuk on Wednesday. It is a strange alliance - the goals of secular pro-Saddam Baathists and radical Islamists would appear antithetical - and ultimately it may prove to be the movement's undoing. The hope in Iraqi government quarters is that before long, when the Iraq army - along with 300 US trainers and Iranian-backed militias - begins to stem the tide of the Isis advance, the insurgents' morale will begin to fall and the cracks among its diverse membership will begin to appear. For now, however, the alliance holds, and as Isis moves towards Baghdad, the fighting will intensify as Iraq's embattled government launches a fight back to stem the advance. In the long run, however, if Baghdad cannot understand the need for political reform is as important as enforcing security then Iraq's problems could last a very long time. Michael Stephens is the Deputy Director of RUSI Qatar currently blogging from Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan in RUSI The Iraq Crisis: Dispatch from the North","As Iraq has spiralled into violence and instability following a lightning-fast advance by the forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) , questions have arisen as to who exactly comprises this group which has posed the most serious threat to Iraq since US and coalition forces removed the dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003."
"Part of its work will be to publish a list of the 10 most-wanted fraudsters and improve intelligence sharing between banks and police. Figures suggest five million frauds occur every year in England and Wales. Last week, figures showed a rise in so-called CEO fraud, where a worker moves cash after a ""bogus boss"" email. In 2015, fraud was included in the official Crime Survey of England and Wales for the first time. The survey suggested that during the previous year there were 5.1m frauds, including those relating to plastic cards and those committed over the phone or online, with just over half involving some financial loss. 'Shames our system' The Joint Fraud Taskforce will include Financial Fraud Action UK, the City of London Police, National Crime Agency, Bank of England, fraud prevention agency Cifas and CEOs of the major banks. The new taskforce will be announced by the home secretary at an event later on Wednesday, which will be attended by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The home secretary is expected to say that ""fraud shames our financial system"". ""It undermines the credibility of the economy, ruins businesses and causes untold distress to people of all walks of life,"" she is to say. ""For too long, there has been too little understanding of the problem and too great a reluctance to take steps to tackle it."" The force's task list will include: In the 12 months ending in March 2015, 230,630 fraud offences were recorded by police in England and Wales, an increase of 9% on the previous year. A further 389,718 fraud offences were reported by industry bodies, 17% up on the year before. Figures from Financial Fraud Action UK, the body which co-ordinates the finance industry's response to fraud, show losses from online banking fraud rose by 48% in 2014 compared with 2013. Overall losses on UK cards totalled £479m in 2014, up 6% on 2013 - the third consecutive year of increase. New figures also show a surge in what is known as CEO or ""bogus boss"" fraud over the past six months. From July 2015 until January 2016, 994 reports of CEO fraud were made to Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. The fraud will typically start with an email being sent from a fraudster - pretending to be a senior figure in the company - to a member of staff in its finance department. The member of staff will be told that they need to quickly transfer money to a certain bank account for a specific reason. The largest reported amount of money given by a member of staff to a fraudster was £18.5m at a global producer of healthcare products - but the average amount is more in the region of £35,000. Steve Proffitt, of Action Fraud, warned businesses to be on high alert. ""Employees should be encouraged to double check everything they do and never be rushed into transferring large amounts of money even if they do think that it's an important task given to them by their CEO,"" he said.","A new taskforce, consisting of police, banks and government officials, is being set up by Home Secretary Theresa May to combat fraud across the UK."
"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Finland's speeding fines are linked to income, with penalties calculated on daily earnings, meaning high earners get hit with bigger penalties for breaking the law. So, when businessman Reima Kuisla was caught doing 103km/h (64mph) in an area where the speed limit is 80km/h (50mph), authorities turned to his 2013 tax return, the Iltalehti newspaper reports. He earned 6.5m euros (£4.72m) that year, so was told to hand over 54,000 euros. The scale of the fine hasn't gone down well with Mr Kuisla. ""Ten years ago I wouldn't have believed that I would seriously consider moving abroad,"" he says on his Facebook page. ""Finland is impossible to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and wealth."" There's little sympathy from his fellow Finns on social media. ""If you follow the rules you won't have to pay fines,"" says one user commenting on the Iltalehti website. ""He should stop complaining and hang his head in shame instead"". Another person says: ""Small fines won't deter the rich - fines have to 'bite' everyone the same way."" But some say the system isn't fair, and punishes the rich in society. Mr Kuisla might be grateful he doesn't earn more. In 2002, an executive at Nokia was slapped with a 116,000-euro fine for speeding on his Harley Davidson motorbike.

"Talks with CVC Partners, which owns a 35% stake in F1, are at an advanced stage, the BBC has learned. Liberty Media has stakes in several sports and entertainment businesses, including the Atlanta Braves Major League baseball club. A source close to the deal told the BBC's sports editor, Dan Roan, that an agreement is yet to be completed and other parties remain in talks. Others that have considered buying into F1 include, Qatar Sports Investments, and Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins American football team. CVC has held a stake for the past decade but sold some of its holding in 2012. A sale would end years of speculation and rumours about a potential change of ownership for the motor sport. German magazine Auto Motor und Sport said the deal had been confirmed by F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone and was worth $8.5bn (£6.5bn). Mr Ecclestone, who owns a 5.3% stake, met with CVC co-chairman Donald Mackenzie and Daimler chief executive Dieter Zetsche, whose company owns the Mercedes team, at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza on Sunday. Mr Ecclestone declined to comment about the sale. The potential takeover by Liberty Media was met with cautious optimism in F1 circles. CVC has been criticised for taking considerable profits from the sport, which has suffered from falling TV ratings in recent years. The domination of the Red Bull and now Mercedes teams has made races more predictable. Mercedes team has won 13 of 14 races this season. Given that Liberty is a media and entertainment group, analysts hope it will give more consideration to the spectacle offered by F1. Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff said: ""If there is an investor that wants to buy the shares it is good news for Formula One. Maybe it is good news that an American media company buys Formula One. There are things we can learn from the American way, particularly in digital areas.""",US-based Liberty Media is in advanced talks to take control of Formula 1.
"Archaeologist Dr George Nash produced the Conservation Management Plan after carrying out fieldwork at the site between 2009 and 2011. He said the Neolithic gallery grave in Delancey Park had been a centre for the ancient community. Dr Nash said it had been a settlement before the site became a grave. He added that the excavation, funded by the trust, had revealed a complex history of the site dating back to the early Neolithic period, some 5,500 years ago. Dr Nash said the plan he submitted was a long-term strategy looking at the strengths, weaknesses and threats to the site and how they could be acted upon. He said: ""I've suggested we do certain things to enhance it, to make it more of an educational facility, but more importantly make it a marker within the park that people can respect, look at and gain some knowledge from."" Dr Nash said they found ""some very nice pieces of flint, but our piece de resistance, so to speak, was the discovery of three very, very small blue glass beads, which probably date to the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age, which is the next period along in the prehistoric sequence. ""It tells us there were local groups probably using the sea as their main source of economics, because of where the site is located, but it also tells something very important - that they were importing stuff from far and wide.""",Plans to conserve a Neolithic site in Guernsey have been submitted to the Admiral de Saumarez Trust and the Guernsey Museums service.

"By Tom de CastellaBBC News Magazine There are regular warnings that people aren't sleeping properly. Too much light from electronic devices before bedtime. Not enough time in bed. Excessive caffeine. Now there's another potential worry - too much light in the bedroom. Previous studies have linked light at night with ill health in rodents. Now a study of 113,000 women suggests that it could cause obesity in humans. The work by Oxford University researchers for the Institute of Cancer Research found that women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was ""light enough to see across"", the researchers found. Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, of the Surrey Sleep Centre, said people ""should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker"". But have our bedrooms got lighter? There has probably been a trend towards lighter rooms over the past century, says Alex Goddard, curator at London's Geffrye Museum, which is devoted to the history of the home. The first problem is more light outside houses. Houses in built-up areas are surrounded by streetlights, car headlights, advertising and other buildings. The Royal Commission on Light Pollution's 2009 report, Artificial Light in the Environment, warned that in the seven years from 1993 to 2000 significant areas of the UK became more intensively lit at night. The commission noted that outdoor lighting in the UK was growing at an estimated rate of about 3% per annum. A survey in October 2007 by Harris Poll Europe Omnibus Survey found a third of those interviewed found that light outside bedroom windows led to sleepless nights. The North West of England reported the worst problems with 44% of respondents having difficulties in sleeping because of light pollution. But as well as the rising amount of light outside our bedrooms, changing home decor trends have exacerbated the problem. Many people choose lighter curtains and there has been a general move away from curtains to blinds. ""In the Victorian period it was all the rage to have very heavy, fulsome curtains,"" Goddard says. ""People liked really luxuriant fabric. Now they don't as it's hard to clean."" Today light spaces with clean lines are desirable. Guardian interiors editor Ben Spriggs agrees. Blinds have become more popular. And curtains are often thinner. ""There's been an increase in linens and sheers, which provide privacy but aren't light-blocking at all."" A lot of it is down to money - thin is cheap, he says. There's also a move to clearing away the clutter from windows, which is what blinds do. At the turn of the millennium blinds represented 25% of the domestic window coverings market, according to Andrew Hartley, director of AMA Research, which conducts research into the construction sector. Now that figure is 30%. By contrast, curtains have fallen back from 52-53% to 47%. Much of that change occurred in the early part of the last decade. Hartley says that although high-specification window coverings - such as plantation-style shutters, blackout curtains and blinds for skylights - have grown over this period, so too have ""lower-quality"" goods at the bottom end of the market, fuelled by the rise in the private rented sector. ""The middle part of the market has been squeezed,"" he says. In short, many people decorating a bedroom may be tempted by window coverings that leave the bedroom in a state of half-light rather than true dark. And inside the rooms there's a fog of light from electronic devices. How many bedrooms are lit by a series of pinpoints from standby lights? Then there's alarm clocks, digital displays and night lights. The decor has an amplifying effect. Dark walls are out, says Goddard. Light colours and wallpaper are in, which don't dampen the light. Bedrooms often have bigger windows today, whether from warehouse conversions or new build, she argues. Property developer Sarah Beeny says she can't sleep unless it's dark. While some parents use blackout curtains for young children, it's rare to find them in adults' rooms, she says. People invest in cheap material, she says. ""It's a great shame people's thinking is short-termist - they think we're going to redecorate in a year or two."" Her top priority is a good lining when buying curtains, she says. But not everyone agrees dark is good. Prof Jim Horne, former head of Loughborough University's Sleep Research Centre, doubts light at night causes obesity. People sleep with their eyes shut and can generally ignore what light there is, he argues. It's lighter in the summer than the winter but there's no evidence that people sleep fewer hours, he adds. Even if people are waking up when it gets light, most people fall asleep again quickly. ""The acid test is, are you sleepy during the day?"" He suspects there may be other reasons for the obesity correlation. ""One has to look at whether sleeping in the dark is a surrogate for something else. Do people who sleep in light rooms have a fear of the dark? Are they more agitated generally?"" They could be more susceptible to putting on weight, he believes. More research is needed before people draw any conclusions, he says. ""The idea that we should all blacken our room is wrong,"" he says. An emphasis on absolutely dark bedrooms could even be dangerous. If it's pitch-black then elderly people getting up in the night might have an accident, Horne says. The evidence is not yet conclusive. But more studies linking light pollution in bedrooms to problems may prompt people to replace those flimsy blinds with thick curtains. And allow sun-streaked bedrooms once again to become places of solemn repose.

"The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found that the number of people looking to buy a home in February increased at the slowest rate since April last year. Statistics showed that a lack of properties for sale meant that house prices continued to rise. However, the report expects the market to pick up over the summer months. Rics' latest residential market survey suggests the initial surge in demand driven by the more accessible housing market had started to ease off slowly. A net balance of 24% of surveyors reported a growth in inquiries from people looking to make a purchase. The comparable figure for January was a 34% net balance of surveyors, while December recorded a 52% balance. 'Lack of properties' Statistics in the survey also suggest the number of homes being placed on the market for sale failed to pick up and supply was still ""falling well short of required levels"". This lack of available properties helped continue the rise in house prices last month, with a balance of 45% more chartered surveyors reporting prices increasing rather than falling. This increase means that the cost of a home has now risen across Scotland for 10 months in a row. Rics Scotland director Sarah Speirs said: ""The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow down in February, as the surge in interest sparked towards the end of last summer began to level off."" She added: ""While this does not mean an end to the increasing activity we've been seeing recently, it does suggest that the pent-up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself.""","The growth in Scotland's housing market has slowed to its lowest rate in a year, according to surveyors."

The Lib Dems won 72 council seats in Wales five years ago - down from 165 in 2008 - in the first set of national elections held after the party formed a coalition with the Conservatives at Westminster in 2010. Since 2012, the party has made a net gain of three council seats as a result of by-elections and defections. But this year's local elections, on 4 May, follow disastrous polls in the previous two years. In 2015, the Liberal Democrats lost two Welsh seats at the general election, leaving Mr Williams as the party's only Welsh MP from Wales. In 2016, Kirsty Williams returned to Cardiff Bay as the party's only AM in the May assembly election after four of her colleagues lost their seats. Soon after, she was appointed to the Labour-led Welsh Government as education secretary. At the campaign launch on Wednesday, Mr Williams said ""our politics has never been more divided"" following last June's Brexit vote. ""These elections offer people and communities across Wales the opportunity to stand up for decent, tolerant values and for ideas that will make our communities stronger, more open and more prosperous,"" he said. ""We need fresh talent, new ideas and passion in our local county and city halls to get things done. ""No more should communities have to accept the complacency, arrogance and laziness rife in our local councils. We won't accept it."" Mr Williams said he would fight ""tooth and nail"" to make local authorities in Wales more transparent, and was optimistic about the party's chances ahead of polling day. ""Five or six years ago we were leading some of the principal authorities in Cardiff and Swansea, in Bridgend and Wrexham and in other places as well,"" he told BBC Wales. ""It's been a hard few years but we need to build on our position,"" Mr Williams added. ""I'm confident at the end of this process we'll have more councillors elected."" The Liberal Democrats hope that, as a consistently pro-EU party, they can boost their levels of support at these local elections by being seen to speak up for voters who wanted to remain in the European Union.","Local government in Wales is rife with ""complacency, arrogance and laziness"", Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mark Williams has said."
"Pupils will no longer have to follow strict two metre physical distancing rules when they return, and must wear face coverings throughout the school. Ms Sturgeon said ""virtually all"" secondary pupils would be back in the classroom after the holidays. The only exception is for those pupils in the shielding category. ""We are continuing to recommend that they stay at home until 26 April, and that's in line with the advice already received from the chief medical officer,"" said Ms Sturgeon. Primary schools had already resumed full-time teaching before the holidays, but a part-time blended learning system had been used in secondary schools. The first minister said the return to in-person, full-time learning would be ""a huge relief"" to many children and parents. She acknowledged that there would be some ""concern and anxiety"" about the move, but said safety would be ""paramount"" ""The return to school will involve the removal, where necessary, of strict two metre distancing between pupils, but we are asking schools to consider how they strengthen their mitigations,"" she said. Secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings at all times, and all age groups will be able to access twice-weekly lateral flow testing. During the coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon was asked about the assessment system for senior pupils following concerns that some would be sitting ""exams by another name"" in coming weeks. She said: ""There is no requirement to replicate a full exam or prelim this year. Teacher judgement is at the centre of this."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats' Alex Cole-Hamilton said he had ""some real concerns"" that the assessments were exams by another name. He said this would put ""tremendous pressure"" on teachers and pupils, adding: ""We have to make sure young people have every support they need."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the full-time return of pupils would bring ""a sense of relief"" for parents. But he added: ""Now we have a ramping up of the vaccine supply, we should be looking at rolling out those vaccines for teachers to give them a sense of confidence, and to pupils and parents as well."" Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teachers' union, said there needed to be ""great caution"" over the return of pupils to school. ""It will undoubtedly lead to an increase in school Covid outbreaks, which will require to be dealt with quickly, particularly for senior pupils who will be in the final stages of their qualification work,"" he said. ""If we had made more progress on the EIS demands of ventilation, vaccination and facemasks, we would be in a stronger position. Improving such mitigations is still possible."" The first minister also told the briefing that the first batch of the newly-approved Moderna vaccine had arrived in Scotland. Scotland is due to receive more than one million of the 17 million doses ordered by the UK. ""The fact that we now have three vaccines in use is clearly very welcome and it does give us greater security of supply which is welcome,"" she said. Responding to questions about the prospect of introducing vaccine passports for those who have had their jab, Ms Sturgeon said it was important ""not to close our minds"" to the idea. She said that if the public are to have confidence in any future certification process, time must be taken to ""air all of the challenges"". ""We all want to get back to normal, so anything that can play a part in getting us back to normal is something we should think about very carefully,"" she said. ""But nor should we gloss over the practical and ethical issues."" The UK government has said the introduction of certificates which could show vaccination, test or immunity status is one option currently being considered. Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Green Party, said she had not been convinced that widespread use of vaccination passports would be a good thing. ""There may be some cases where this is appropriate, but I would be extremely concerned about the introduction of a vaccine passport at a domestic level,"" she said. A total of 2,577,816 people in Scotland have now received their first dose and 463,780 have received their second dose. There were 259 positive cases of Covid reported in the last 24 hours, a positivity rate of 2%. No further deaths were recorded. Ms Sturgeon said routine testing will be expanded to enable everyone to take a lateral flow test twice a week. A similar move was announced in England on Monday. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the figures indicated that things were moving in the right direction. He said this meant there were ""a number of reopenings that can be safely and cautiously brought forward"" - such as allowing alcohol to be served with a meal indoors in pubs and restaurants.","Secondary schools in Scotland will reopen full time as planned after the Easter holidays, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed."
"The Smithsonian National Museum of American History had run a campaign to save its pair of the famous shoes from deterioration and discolouration. The slippers are one of the most viewed items at the Washington DC museum. But age has taken its toll and they have turned from a sparkling red to a dull brown. Officials at the museum said they reached their goal late on Sunday night thanks to more than 5,300 supporters in 41 countries. The campaign started on 17 October and had 30 days to reach its target. The museum is also planning to announce another fundraising goal shortly involving one of the characters from the famous film. The funds raised by the Kickstarter campaign will be used for immediate conservation care and a new, state-of-the-art display case designed to protect the slippers from environmental harm and slow their deterioration. Future plans include moving the ruby slippers into a new exhibition on American popular culture, scheduled to open in 2018. Anonymous donation The shoes contain a dozen different materials. The sequins are made of gelatin with a primitive plastic coating, and their red colour has faded because the coating has flaked off, partly due to the effects of light and moisture. ""We're going to have to do a lot of scientific research to come up with a treatment plan that is compatible with all of the different materials,"" Ms Machado said. The shoes also include glass beads and red felt on the soles, which was used to muffle their sound when Garland wore them during dance sequences. They were donated anonymously to the museum in 1979.

"Kate Osborne posted a parody image of a wincing Mrs May alongside a gun-holding Samuel L Jackson in the film Pulp Fiction, on social media in 2017. She has been chosen for the safe seat of Jarrow after the suspension of Stephen Hepburn. Ms Osborne admitted that posting the image had ""caused offence"". A number of female Labour candidates have written to the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) urging it to rethink Ms Osborne's selection Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Ms Osborne's actions were ""totally unacceptable"". She said: ""As somebody who's faced a level of abuse and death threats as a politician, I think a lot of people out there really don't see the vitriol and the nastiness that's online or that's pointed towards politicians at the moment. ""So I think it's totally unacceptable to share images like that."" She said it would be up the NEC to decide Ms Obsborne's future. The image, which the current North Tyneside councillor posted during the 2017 general election campaign, depicts Mrs May being threatened with a gun and ordered to stop saying the words ""strong and stable"". In a statement Ms Osborne said: ""I shared an image on social media of a film parody poster making light of Theresa May's forced and robotic statements about her 'strong and stable government' in the run-up to the 2017 general election. ""I unreservedly apologise for having shared this image, which I immediately deleted two years ago, as soon as I realised that it had caused offence. ""As a woman, I am extremely concerned about the abuse and threats that women in politics face and if elected I will work with colleagues to challenge misogyny, hate and division in politics and beyond."" Mr Hepburn was suspended by the Labour Party last month, as it launched an investigation into claims he sexually harassed a female party member in her 20s at a curry house 14 years ago.

"He and another protest leader, Imran Khan, are demanding the resignation of PM Nawaz Sharif. On Tuesday the protesters entered the high-security red zone, which houses state buildings and foreign embassies. The military has urged dialogue to end the impasse between the government and the protest leaders. Reversing an earlier command which blocked all access, Mr Qadri told followers that while they should stay put at all exits, they should let people move in and out of government buildings. Mr Qadri's baton-wielding followers are currently blocking the parliament building's front exits on Constitution Avenue, says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan. The cleric had earlier told followers not to let anyone enter or leave the parliament building, where MPs and Mr Sharif met on Wednesday afternoon. The lawmakers had to use a rear exit to leave the building. Parliament was adjourned till Thursday. Employees of the civil secretariat and other offices in the vicinity also had to be evacuated under strict security, says our correspondent. Earlier on Wednesday, army spokesman General Asim Bajwa made the call for dialogue on his verified Twitter account. ""[The] situation requires patience, wisdom and sagacity from all stakeholders to resolve [the] prevailing impasse through meaningful dialogue in larger national and public interest,"" he said. The buildings in the red zone were symbols of the state and were protected by the army, ""therefore sanctity of these national symbols must be respected"". Mr Qadri said his group would not ""violate the sanctity"" of government buildings. The two opposition groups that are currently camped out in Islamabad are led by opposition politician Imran Khan and Mr Qadri. Both groups marched from Lahore. Both protest leaders want a change of government, and Mr Khan has accused Mr Sharif's party of vote-rigging in the 2013 election. The government has accused the protesters of attempting to derail democracy. They have offered talks with the demonstrators, but these have been rejected.",Pakistan's anti-government cleric Tahirul Qadri has called on protesters to continue guarding state buildings amid a massive sit-in in Islamabad.
"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter The 44-year-old writes, directs and stars in Boy Erased, about so-called gay conversion therapy - which involves treating people to try to turn them straight. The practice has been widely condemned, but remains legal in many places. ""My greatest hope is that this film is redundant as soon possible,"" Edgerton tells BBC News. ""Whatever we can do to end conversion therapy."" Boy Erased is based on a memoir of the same name by Garrard Conley, an American author who wrote about what it was like to go through one of the programmes. Having read the book, Edgerton was keen to adapt it for the big screen, and hopes the resulting film will form part of a wider movement to end the practice. ""But in the meantime,"" he says, ""it's a great movie for parents who are dealing with anything akin to what Garrard's parents are dealing with."" Edgerton explains it shows ""parents getting something wrong in terms of how to accept and love their child"", and audiences see ""whether they're willing to acknowledge that mistake"". In the US, conversion therapy is favoured by often religious parents who enlist their children in the hope of turning them straight. The film is insightful for anyone who has ever wondered what kind of methods might be used. Male participants are seen being given instructions on posture - for example, being encouraged to stand a certain way or not sit with their legs crossed. They repeat lines dictated by the coaches apologising for their sins, are not allowed access to their phones and have to be accompanied during bathroom breaks. Gay conversion therapy is being outlawed in many parts of the world but it remains a controversial issue - especially in the US, where it is legal in 41 states. In the UK, it was announced last year that such therapies are to be banned as part of a government plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people. Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt told the BBC at the time that the aim of this ""very extreme so-called therapy"" was to ""try and 'cure' someone from being gay - of course you can't cure someone from being gay."" A national survey of 108,000 members of the British LGBT community suggested 2% have undergone the practice, with another 5% having been offered it. However, there exists a strand of opinion that so-called gay conversion therapy is effective. In 2017, Good Morning Britain ran an interview with an advocate of the practice, which became the most complained about TV moment of that year. ""I believe people are not born gay, that they come into homosexual feelings, and that it is something that in some cases is reversible for people who want to make that the trajectory of their lives,"" Dr Michael Davidson told the programme. That school of thought is one Edgerton is hoping to help eradicate with the release of Boy Erased, which has received broadly positive reviews. ""The film deserves praise not as a polemic but as a richly humanistic, emotionally searing drama that sticks in the memory,"" said The Hollywood Reporter. But, asked The San Diego Reader: ""If you know someone who is thinking of putting their kid though one of these programs, buy them a ticket. If not, what's the point?"" Many critics picked up on the key role of Jared's mother and father, played by Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe (Garrard's real name has been changed to Jared in the film). ""To its great credit, Boy Erased never reduces Jared's parents to monolithic, backwards-thinking caricatures,"" said The Chicago Sun Times. ""Kidman brings stirring compassion and a growing strength to a woman who learns about herself the more she learns about her son."" Edgerton acknowledges that he didn't want to make the characters of the parents into villains. He recalls reading Conley's book and expecting there to be ""blood and sweat on the pages, to be reading about vicious, awful parents"". ""What I actually discovered,"" he continues, ""was parents who really love their child, who, given the information they had at their disposal, and the belief system they'd founded their lives on, were doing what they were doing as an act of love, with the intention of helping their son. ""And that was far more complicated, I think, than the easy space we could've occupied, of going 'the parents are evil villains and the therapists are evil people.' Movies are definitely easier to read in that sense, but that would be dishonest. ""And I think to give the therapists, and to give the parents, not a free ride, but an honest rendering, is a far more fertile ground to have the conversation about what is right and wrong, than to just make it an easy profitable movie about heroes and villains."" Conley has repeatedly shied away from attacking his parents for their actions - and has been criticised by some readers who said he has humanised them too much. ""My parents made a terrible mistake which could have cost me my life. But they didn't know what they were doing to me,"" Conley told BBC News last year. ""I've seen the film a few times and it's so true to the book. It's not sensational at all. I don't feel it got the Hollywood treatment."" The film closes with a series of captions about the number of US states where conversion therapy remains legal, and what happened to some of the characters in real life. Closing a film with such a campaign message is risky, and Edgerton worried about the film coming off as preachy as a result. ""Absolutely, there was massive debate and my first point of view was I didn't want to turn the film into a public service announcement by having statistics at the end of the film,"" he says. ""And yet, as I got deeper into cutting the film and realising how important this issue is, I figured it was worth our while to leave some information in the hands of the audience in order for them to take away just how current and real and important the issue is."" Boy Erased is released in the UK on Friday.","Aside from box office success, one thing most directors hope their film has is longevity. Not Joel Edgerton."
"By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Reading researchers announced in June that the floes would cover 5.4 million sq km come the end of the melt season - give or take half a million. US agencies called the actual number on Monday as 5.02 million sq km. The British team's modelled forecast hangs on the amount of water ponding on top of the ice as it warms in the spring. These ponds have been shown to promote melting. Projecting the behaviour of seasonal ice in the Arctic has been a difficult problem. Achieving a good level of skill - even just a few months ahead - would be useful to many sectors. Shipping, tourism and oil industries - all are looking to exploit the opportunities that will emerge in an Arctic that is expected to become more open in a warming climate. Public projection It is two years running now that Reading's meltpond forecasts have landed virtually on the button. For September 2013, the group's spring projection was for a mean ice extent of 5.55 million sq km. The eventual number again fell within the uncertainty bounds, at 5.35 million sq km. But unlike the 2013 forecast, this year's projection was made publicly in advance. The polar modelling community was watching. The projection of 5.4 million sq km (4.9-5.9 million sq km) was technically for the ""September average"" extent. This number will be known in a few days, but is likely to be more than 5.02 and therefore even closer to the Reading forecast. ""The fact that we have this repeated success lends some confidence,"" Prof Daniel Feltham from the NERC Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at Reading told BBC News. ""We have error bars, and we can describe skill as being between one and zero, where one is perfect and zero is terrible. We're about 0.4 or 0.5. ""That may not sound very good, but it's still a lot better than anything else that's out there,"" he explained. Weather uncertainty As the sun rises in the Arctic in the spring, the sea ice starts to melt and water will begin to pond on top of the floes. This will change the pack's reflectiveness, or albedo. The ponds are darker than the bare ice and therefore absorb more of the Sun's energy, driving further melting. Prof Feltham's team has developed a model to forecast the evolution of melt ponds in the Arctic and has incorporated this into more general climate sea-ice models. Satellite records show that the year with the smallest pond fraction in late spring (11% in 1996) had the biggest sea ice extent in September; and the year with the largest pond fraction (34% in 2012) featured the all-time low extent come the autumn. ""There is a fundamental limit to how skilful we can be with this,"" said Prof Feltham. ""If we're making a prediction for September in the spring, it means we've still got to contend with a few months of weather, and we can't capture all the natural variability in the system."" Prof Feltham described his team's work at a major UK Royal Society conference on the Arctic this week.

"Jenny Hockey, 70, and Freda Brayshaw, 72, were accused of public order offences after a stand-off with police officers and contractors in November. The pair were part of a group campaigning against the felling of trees in Rustlings Road. But at a hearing at Sheffield Magistrates' Court earlier the case was discontinued. Sheffield City Council contractors began cutting down eight trees on the street on 17 November as part of an improvement scheme. The council said the work needed to be done as part of a £2bn scheme to get rid of diseased, damaging or dangerous trees. Campaigners said the trees were healthy and should remain. The council later apologised for the dawn felling tactics and vowed not to repeat them. 'Obviously relieved' Mrs Hockey, a retired sociology professor, and Mrs Brayshaw, a retired teacher, arrived at court but were told that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided not to proceed with the case. Speaking outside, Mrs Brayshaw said: ""We're obviously very relieved that the case hasn't been taken forward. ""It's been a whole chain of surprises. We couldn't make head nor tail of it and we were prepared for anything this morning. ""But it won't bring back the trees. As the months have gone by, living without the tree that was outside my house, it almost gets worse."" Mrs Hockey said she was originally arrested under trade union legislation but was eventually charged with a public order offence. Speaking at the time of their arrests, Sheffield Hallam MP Nick Clegg said: ""I do not know what planet these people are on. ""Arresting elderly residents? Arresting them when they are just trying to say 'don't chop this tree down'?""",Charges against two women who were arrested after a tree-felling protest in Sheffield have been dropped.
"Campaigners say United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust's (ULHT) decision to downgrade Grantham A&E in June was taken without public involvement. At a judicial review hearing it was argued the failure to consult was a breach of legislation. ULHT deny breaking the law and say that swift action was needed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Plans to replace the A&E department in Grantham with an urgent care centre were first revealed on 8 June and were approved three days later. The trust said the change, which came in to force on 22 June, would mean Grantham could become a Covid-free site allowing it to restart elective surgery and cancer treatments. It said the alteration to services would run until at least 31 March. On Thursday, Vikram Sachdeva QC, said the trust, however, had breached legislation demanding service users are involved in the decision making process. He also claimed that while the trust had not released the plans until 8 June the plan for Grantham was ""the only show in town"" by at least 26 May and the proposal could have been shared with the public at that stage. He also argued that despite the impact of the pandemic the trust still had a ""mandatory duty"" to uphold. For ULHT, Fenella Morris QC, said as well as the requirement to involve the public the trust was also bound by law to act ""effectively, efficiently and economically"". She argued that in a situation requiring ""instantaneous"" action, such as a pandemic, a rigid application of the legislation would ""render all of those decisions unlawful"". She also told the court that while ""broad parameters"" of the plan were in place by June the precise detail was not and the trust did not want to present an ""inchoate proposal"" for fear of raising public anxiety.

"Ray Johnson's film, Prepare To Launch, covers the liner's construction and its county connections. It tells the story of Captain Edward Smith, who was born in Stoke-on-Trent, and the making of the ship's anchor in the county. Mr Johnson said he wanted to convey the sense of ""hope for the future"" that existed during the ship's construction.

"Some 1,000 people, many of them Iraqi Kurds, have been living on the Grande Synthe site. The gym was made available for migrants seeking shelter by the town last year. Now a court has ordered the gym to be closed to migrants because of local complaints. There are fears this may all prompt a further spike in crossings to England. At the weekend 41 people were stopped in three small boats and a kayak by UK border officials, and 86 people were intercepted a week ago by the UK's Border Force. A further 29 migrants were stopped as they headed towards the Kent coast on Monday. After Calais, Dunkirk is one of the closest French ports to the English coast and authorities had already moved in to clear the camp in October 2018 when almost 1,800 people lived there. When the gym opened up to migrants in December 2018, the original aim was to close it in the spring, but by August 2019 170 people were being housed there and a further 800 were in tents nearby. French authorities also cleared an area outside Calais last Friday. What happened on Tuesday? Gendarmes and riot police moved in at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) almost a fortnight after a judge in Lille ruled that the camp was a risk to public security. The ruling cited smugglers and criminal networks operating at Grande Synthe, as well as brawls and violence. People were being seen being driven away in buses during the morning. Reports said the migrants had been split into families, unaccompanied minors and others. Officials said most of them would be driven to emergency shelters throughout the north-west of France. ""I reckon everyone here was happy to get out of the shantytown that Grande-Synthe has become,"" said local prefect Michel Lalande. ""We're bringing an end to it this morning and that's good news for rule of law and human rights."" ""You should know that if they ask for asylum in France, they have an 80% chance of getting it,"" Dunkirk official Éric Étienne told La Voix du Nord. 'Britain seen as Promised Land' By Lesley Ashmall, BBC Radio 5 Live People smugglers have infiltrated this camp and that is why the French authorities want it closed. Last night we had access inside the camp and saw smugglers walking around openly, through the makeshift shops, trying to entice people to pay money to get them on boats and lorries to come to the UK. Early this morning, hundreds of police officers arrived here along with large empty buses. All the buses have now left and there are now some tents abandoned. Cleaners have moved in, but it's a vast job at such a big camp. People in the camp last night seemed undeterred and some saw Britain as the Promised Land. There are migrant camps all over northern France, and charities think they will just go somewhere else. Those I spoke to, including families with small children, said they would just keep trying. An estimated 1,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats this year and French and UK officials are concerned about the involvement of smugglers persuading people they have to leave because of the UK government's pledge to leave the European Union by 31 October. ""Every day they try to cross by boat, very little boats and it's very dangerous but the mafia always take a lot of money,"" complained charity worker Claudette Hannebicque, who believes Brexit has had an impact on numbers trying to cross the Channel. ""Sometimes the police here arrest mafia or put them in prison. But here there's a 'little mafia' - the big big boss is not here,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.",French police have begun an operation to evacuate a gymnasium and a tent camp near the northern port of Dunkirk amid an increase in migrants trying to cross the Channel.
"The RAF said its quick reaction alert Typhoon aircraft were deployed on Wednesday morning and safely escorted the plane to the airport, near London. Flights were temporarily grounded at Stansted but have since resumed. Ryanair said the flight from Kaunas in Lithuania to Luton was diverted ""in line with procedures"". 'Bomb threat' One passenger, Jonathan Zulberg, said when passengers boarded the flight they saw fire engines and a police car but were not told about a threat being made.

"Former Cambridge University rugby player Oluwadamilola Erogbogbo, 23, of Kiln Place, Camden, denies attempted rape and sexual assault. The witness said his friend had come out of her room in a ""panicked"" state following the alleged attack in 2015. But Mr Erogbogbo told Cambridge Crown Court he ""did not touch"" the woman. The jury had previously heard the defendant and the woman, who had slept together before, had a ""blazing row"" in a nightclub on 5 November 2015. The witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court on Friday that he had gone to the alleged victim's college room after receiving messages from her in the early hours of the morning. In the messages she said Mr Erogbogbo, known as Lola, was in her room. When the witness turned up with another friend and knocked on the door he said the woman had come out of her room crying.

'Wanted her to apologise' In his evidence, politics student Mr Erogbogbo told the court he was upset when during the row at the nightclub the alleged victim described him as a ""rapist"", in reference to him having multiple sexual partners. The defendant said he went back to her room after the argument and told the court he had wanted her to apologise. He said: ""Looking back I was quite upset and not acting in the right way. ""But I was so upset from what had happened. So embarrassed and mortified that someone would call me a rapist."" After the alleged victim left her room, Mr Erogbogbo said he tried to call her because he was still angry and had waited outside her college.

"Twelve in-patient beds at Edward Hain Community Hospital in St Ives closed in February 2016 due to fire safety concerns, but other clinics continued. Governing body NHS Kernow said the whole site was now to ""close permanently and ... no longer be used for health and care purposes"". It added it was working ""to relocate the community clinics to a safe and appropriate environment"" in the town. NHS Kernow said the decision came ""after careful consideration of all the work with local people over more than 18 months to review the future use"" of the hospital. It added that its members also considered community feedback during ""four weeks of extra engagement with the wider public"", and proposals from Cornwall Council's health and adult social care scrutiny committee. It said: ""We will work with Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust to relocate the community clinics to a safe and appropriate environment in St Ives.""

"Sala, 28, was travelling to Cardiff in a plane piloted by David Ibbotson, which went missing over the English Channel on 21 January. His body was recovered from the plane wreck last week but Mr Ibbotson's body has still not been found. Sala was flying to join his new side Cardiff City from French club Nantes when the plane went missing. Julio Muller, mayor of Sala's hometown of Progreso, said the footballer's family had arrived for the service. Mr Muller said Sala's body would arrive in the late afternoon on Friday and be taken to the gymnasium next to his youth club's headquarters, where a vigil was scheduled. His boyhood club San Martin de Progreso posted an emotional tribute on Facebook, saying: ""We are waiting for you...like the first day you left but this time to stay with us forever. ""You went and you are an example for everyone. Eternally in our hearts."" Authorities formally identified Sala's body last week, with his family saying they could ""now begin to mourn our son and our brother."" Sala died of ""head and trunk injuries,"" an inquest heard on Monday. His former teammates gave him a rousing send off on Sunday, playing a French league match in a special black kit with each player wearing Sala's name on the back of their jersey.",The body of footballer Emiliano Sala is to be flown back to his hometown in Argentina where a vigil is planned.
"The RAC handled about 30,000 incidents last year, including damaged suspensions and wheels, despite a milder winter than previous years. But councils said they are facing a 10-year, £12 billion backlog of repairs. The most calls for help came from drivers in the east of England, 4,547 in total. But the biggest increase was in south-east England, 62% up on the year before. Winter frosts normally damage road surfaces but the RAC described the increase as ""worrying"" because the weather has been milder than in previous years. The north-east of England saw an increase to 3,783 call-outs, while the RAC's 'mid-western' and 'north-west' regions, which take in Wales and the West Midlands, saw more than 3,000 incidents each. The figures emerged on National Pothole day, set up by Colin Mahoney, the founder of the Streetrepairs.co.uk website. English councils have already been allocated a share of £4.7 billion over six years to tackle the problem of potholes, which can lead to local authorities paying out compensation to drivers whose vehicles are damaged. A further £1.3bn is being put towards repairs of junctions, bridges and street lighting as well as an incentive scheme for councils to deliver cost-effective improvements. 'Worrying rise' When the funding was allocated in 2014 transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said it would be enough to fix around 18 million potholes. But RAC chief engineer David Bizley said: ""It is very worrying that our patrols have dealt with more pothole-related breakdowns in 2015 than they did the year before because we did not experience a particularly cold winter in either year. ""On top of the £6 billion already promised, the Chancellor made available further funds in the Autumn Statement and whilst this is still not enough to meet the shortfall, it may hopefully mean we will see a decline in 'pothole generated breakdowns' this time next year."" Backlog Councillor Peter Box, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: ""Councils fixed more potholes than ever before last year - one every 15 seconds - and keeping roads safe is one of the most important jobs we do. ""However, a backlog of road repairs of about £12 billion would already take councils more than a decade to clear."" Transport Minister Andrew Jones said: ""I know how important well-maintained roads are to people up and down Britain. That is why the government is providing unprecedented levels of investment, allocating a record £6 billion to councils in England to improve local roads over the next five years. ""We have topped this up with £250 million announced by the Chancellor in the Autumn Statement, specifically to tackle the blight of potholes, a £300 million increase compared to the last Parliament equipping us to fill over 4.5 million potholes.""","The number of callouts to cars damaged by potholes increased by a quarter in one year, according to new figures."
"Linda YuehChief business correspondent It's thought to be based on the life of rapper Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, who has launched a music streaming business where artists ranging from Madonna to Coldplay are equity partners. In Empire, Lucious Lyon, played by Terrence Howard, entices Snoop Dog to his label with a share of the profits. He and his sons win over artists by outlining a vision of a label that understands that people listen to music streamed on the internet, and offers them part ownership in the newly publicly traded company. Jay-Z has garnered some 15 artists as co-owners of Tidal, a music streaming business that is based on his recent acquisition of Swedish Aspiro for $56m (£38m). He's offering stock and cash in exchange for their promotion of Tidal. I've written before about the end of the record collection as music streaming has grown rapidly - registering over 50% growth in 2013 from a year earlier in global markets. Downloads declining In the US for the first time, streaming is bigger than CDs. In 2014, streaming services generated more revenues than CDs, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora accounted for $1.87bn in revenues in 2014, which amounts to 27% of total industry revenue, growing from 21% the year before even as the industry's revenue growth has remained flat for the last five years. This is while digital downloads, such as those purchased from Apple's iTunes store, have been in decline since 2012. Downloads had been the largest source of digital revenue for a decade, but revenues have fallen from that peak and dropped by 8.7% in 2014, though they still account for 37% of total industry revenues. It follows that Apple will soon launch a streaming service, Beats Music, after it acquired Beats Electronics for an eye-watering $3bn from hip hop artist Dr Dre last year. Just like in Empire, there's unmissable symbolism in a company that's owned by artists in an industry dominated by big record labels. In a dramatic depiction of the tensions between artists and record bosses, Jamal Lyon, played by Jussie Smollett, dangled the boss of Creedmoor over a balcony to get the rights to his father's music back. Fee or free? Tidal isn't seeking to be a record company. Jay-Z describes Tidal as a record store. As such, it'll face stiff competition from the players already in the market. Pandora and Spotify each have more than 70 million subscribers who access the free tier of their streaming services. Streaming is certainly popular, but its fast growth may well be because it's free. Indeed, the numbers are a lot smaller when just counting those who pay a subscription fee. Spotify counts 15 million subscribers who pay $9.99 per month and Pandora says they have 3.3 million who pay $5 per month. Tidal won't have a free subscription service. It'll offer 2 tiers - standard definition at $9.99 per month in line with Spotify and a high definition stream for $19.99 a month. Apple's Music Beats, to be launched this summer, also will not have a free tier. The artist/owners of Tidal, including Alicia Keys, Beyonce, Coldplay, Daft Punk, Jack White, Kanye West, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, and Rihanna, are planning to offer ""exclusive experiences"" to make choosing Tidal and paying for a subscription worthwhile. It'll need to be fairly appealing to win over those paying customers, who are but a small fraction of those enjoying music streaming on the internet. For the music business, the trend is clear. The music industry, like many others, is being transformed by the digital age.","It's life imitating art. The popular US TV show, Empire, is based on a music mogul whose record label offers artists a rare share in the business."
"By Christopher Giles and Upasana BhatBBC Reality Check and Anti-disinformation unit Despite a ceasefire agreed at the weekend, the fighting has continued and hundreds have died. Armenia's prime minister has said there is no diplomatic solution ""at this stage"" to the Karabakh issue. The enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is under Armenian control. 'Information wars' We've found re-edited and old video footage wrongly labelled as portraying recent events. Disinformation in conflicts is not uncommon, where accessing accurate information can prove difficult. The current clashes in the South Caucasus region are no different, and few journalists have gained access to the frontline, leaving people to rely on government media and footage from mobile phones, as well as rumours that spread unverified on social media. We've also identified efforts to amplify politicised hashtags and posts. False missile videos While the majority of online media being shared is either news reports, official government information or campaign slogans and images, there is also plenty of doctored or old footage. Some of the most widely-spread content involves dramatic scenes of missile exchanges, which has nothing to do with the current conflict. One video, posted on Twitter, claims to show Iranians watching the 2020 Armenia-Azerbaijan ""war"" at the border. It has been viewed more than 250,000 times. However, a reverse image search shows it is actually from a military day event in Russia from November 2019. People in the video are speaking Russian, and one person is wearing woollen clothing with the word ""Russia"" written on the back. The user apologised for posting the video after finding out it wasn't legitimate, but it remains on Twitter. There's also been footage from the popular military video game Arma 3, wrongly claiming to show the war. It has been posted on many platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. It was even used by an Indian TV news channel as ""exclusive"" footage of Armenia shooting down an Azerbaijani aircraft. The original video, which has been edited into real footage of clashes, was first posted on YouTube by a Japanese channel in August 2020, with the disclaimer at the end that it is ""fiction"". Are Syrian fighters involved? There are claims that Azerbaijan has drafted in foreign mercenaries to bolster their forces. The accusations are often targeted at Turkey, which backs Azerbaijan, claiming that it has facilitated the drafting of Syrian fighters into Azerbaijan's military. The Turkish government has strongly denied these allegations, despite French President Emmanuel Macron and human rights organisations concluding that these fighters are present. Turkey has previously sent Syrian fighters to another conflict zone, in support of the UN-backed government based in Tripoli, Libya, against rival forces. BBC Arabic has contacted one man who says he was recruited in northern Syria ""to guard military points"" on Azerbaijan's borders. Speculation has been heightened by a slew of viral videos on social media claiming to show Syrian fighters involved in the conflict. It is difficult to confirm if these viral images do indeed show Syrian mercenaries operating within the current conflict. Posts about Armenian-Yazidi soldiers There are baseless claims online that Yazidi fighters from Iraq are supporting Armenia. There are ethnic Yazidis fighting for Armenia, but these are Armenian-Yazidis. They're not foreign fighters. For example, there are plenty of Armenian accounts proudly sharing photos of Yazidi people among their forces. There are around 30,000 Yazidis who live in Armenia. Seeking international support Online platforms have become a battleground for Azerbaijanis and Armenians looking to garner support and raise international awareness of their cause. Social media activity has been bolstered by active users outside the region, and in particular by Kim Kardashian, who is of Armenian heritage and has one of the largest online followings in the world. A BBC analysis of popular phrases on social media platforms has identified a significant increase in terms related to the clashes. The countries' names ""Armenia"" and ""Azerbaijan"" have, over the past week, received more than 20 and 17 million engagements on Facebook, respectively. There are also hashtags such as #WeWillWin, #DontBelieveArmenia, and #StopAzerbaijanAggression being used in English and in Armenian, Azeri, Turkish and other regional languages. Both governments have also been weighing in. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Defence, for example, produces some of the most shared material, usually praising the military's accomplishments and showing attacks on Armenian defence forces. One video posted recently on its Facebook page had more than 100,000 views. Co-ordinated campaigns Some of the efforts to fight the ""information war"" involve large-scale co-ordination online. In online conversations, Armenian social media users have discussed their failure to mobilise on social media during the clashes in June, and have bolstered their efforts in recent weeks. There are private Facebook groups, with names such as ""cybers armies"" and ""media fighters"", in which supporters of Armenia are suggesting posts and hashtags, and co-ordinate to amplify the content. One group, created two weeks ago, has more than 100,000 members. Many Azerbaijani people have also been heavily sharing content. While much of it is legitimately trying to generate support online, there are accusations of ""inauthentic online behaviour"", activity co-ordinated using fictitious accounts and personas. The Australia-based International Cyber Policy Centre (ICPC) found a surge in the creation of Twitter accounts at the end of September associated with hashtags linked with the conflict. The ICPC's report adds: ""These efforts may include co-ordinated authentic activity by real users, as well as suspicious or inauthentic activity."" Facebook has taken steps to remove some accounts associated with Azerbaijan. It says there were ""589 Facebook accounts, 7,906 Pages and 447 accounts on Instagram that were involved in co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour."" It added: ""This network appeared to engage individuals in Azerbaijan to manage pages with the sole purpose of leaving supportive and critical commentary. ""Their comments frequently touched on local and regional news and events, politics, government policies, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

Nagorno-Karabakh - key facts",The conflict that has raged for weeks over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh has fuelled the spread of misleading social media content.
"Beales, which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881, said 22 stores and 1,000 jobs were at stake if it cannot find a buyer. The firm is negotiating with its landlords to try and agree rent reductions. It is also in talks with two potential buyers - a rival retailer and a venture capital investor, the BBC understands. Chief Executive Tony Brown led a management buyout of the firm in 2018. Analysis By Rob Young, BBC business correspondent It's a brutal time for retailers. Debenhams began closing 19 shops yesterday. Mothercare's 79 UK stores will stop trading today. Now Beales, with its 22 stores up and down the country, confirmed that it may have to call in administrators. Beales has been around for almost 140 years, but poorer than expected trading over Christmas threatens its survival. Even if its immediate future can be assured, store closures aren't being ruled out, with a risk to jobs. The British Retail Consortium said last year was the high street's worst on record. In the year to March 2019, Beale Ltd posted a loss of £3.1m, up from £1.3m for the year earlier as costs swelled and sales dipped. Beales has stores in the following towns and cities: It comes after UK retail sales fell for the first time in a quarter of a century last year. Sales in November and December fell by 0.9%, according to industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC). John Lewis has warned that its staff bonus may be in doubt as it reported Christmas sales at its department stores were down 2% for stores open at least a year. Last week, fashion chain Superdry warned that its profits could be wiped out after sales fell sharply over Christmas. The firm, which has been trying to sell more clothes at full price, said it had been hit by ""unprecedented levels of promotional activity"" by rivals. A raft of collapses in 2019 including Jessops, card chain Clintons, Bonmarche and Karen Millen depressed rents and hit landlords. Some companies are prospering, however. Sports fashion retailer JD Sports says it expects to report full-year profits at the top end of forecasts. Next lifted its profit forecast after better than expected sales over Christmas trading period. The company's full-price sales rose by 5.2%. And big companies are using the tough environment to experiment. Ikea will open its first small-format store in the UK, following the acquisition of a shopping centre in London. The Swedish retail giant paid £170m for the Kings Mall Shopping Centre in Hammersmith.",One of Britain's oldest department stores has warned that it could collapse into administration.
"Caroline WyattReligious affairs correspondent@CarolineWyatton Twitter On Tuesday, Pope Francis will open the original Holy Door at St Peter's Basilica in Rome, the first time it has been opened since the turn of the century, to mark the official start of a year laden with symbolism for Catholics across the world. So what does it mean? The clue to the aim of the Year of Mercy is in its name: a time for the Church itself and for Catholics everywhere to show mercy and compassion, in thought and in deed, and focus on forgiveness, reconciliation and doing good in concrete ways for the needy and those on the margins of society. The crossing of the threshold of a Holy Door is a sign of spiritual renewal, and the passage from sin to grace. Pope Francis has long signalled his wish to change the Church's approach from condemnation of wrongdoing to a Church more forgiving of its flock, and more understanding of the difficulties faced by believers today. This extraordinary jubilee year is a practical way of giving expression to that wish, and creating a Church that is a ""field hospital"", healing and binding the wounds of its flock. Announcing the extraordinary jubilee this March, the Pope said: ""The greater the sin, the greater the love the Church must express,"" writing that the Holy Door is a ""Door of Mercy, through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons and instils hope."" Pope Francis took many by surprise when he announced earlier this year that as part of the jubilee, all parish priests across the world would be allowed to absolve repentant women who asked for forgiveness for having an abortion, even though Church teaching still terms abortion a grave sin. Forgiveness for abortion He has, in effect, already begun the jubilee by opening the Holy Door of the Cathedral in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, during his recent trip to Africa. It was one of many symbolic gestures he made in a nation torn by fighting between Christians and Muslims. The Pope has also made clear he wants this jubilee to open a year of ""fervent dialogue"" between Christians, Muslims and Jews, so that all who believe in a merciful God show more mercy towards one another, driving out violence, disrespect and discrimination. He said that the Christian profession of faith in God's mercy ""relates us to Judaism and Islam, both of which consider mercy to be one of God's most important attributes"". In a year marked by cruel conflicts, terrorist attacks and natural disasters across the globe, the jubilee is expected to draw millions of pilgrims to Rome, where the city authorities and the Vatican have been working together to ensure security. Earthly technology Italian security forces will be on high alert, while Rome has declared a no-fly zone for drones as well as regular aircraft, although Vatican officials say they had no knowledge of any specific or credible plot to attack the city or the Vatican. While trusting in God, the Vatican has also invested in earthly technology, with visitors having to pass through metal detectors on St Peter's Square before they can enter. Jubilee Years: Jubilee years are rooted in the Old Testament tradition of freeing slaves and prisoners once every 50 years, a concept that died out within Judaism but was taken up by Pope Boniface VIII for the Catholic Church in 1300. Pilgrimages to Rome were at the heart of the original jubilee years, and attracted hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to the city, many willing to pay for ""indulgences"" - the eradication by the Church of the spiritual debt arising from sin. It was a tradition that not only contributed copious cash to the Vatican's coffers, but also contributed to the theological turmoil that led to the establishment of rival Protestant churches across much of northern Europe. The last Jubilee was called by St John Paul II to mark the millennium, and this Holy Year of Mercy starts on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 2015 and will end on the Feast of Christ the King on 20 November 2016. In an innovation by Pope Francis, Holy Doors will also be opened this year at cathedrals, some churches and shrines around the world for those unable to make the pilgrimage to Rome. In England, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, will open the Holy Door at Westminster Cathedral, while Holy Doors will also be opened in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and many churches will hold special services on Sunday to mark the start of the jubilee.","Appropriately for the weeks of Advent leading up to Christmas, carpenters and other tradespeople have been kept busy in the run-up to the Jubilee Holy Year of Mercy, installing or ensuring that the Holy Doors, due to be opened at Roman Catholic cathedrals and churches across the world, are safe and functioning."

"She said she would move her only remaining dollar account and urged officials to do the same. High inflation, officially at 9.8% but unofficially at about 25%, means many Argentines see dollars as a safe bet. The government, which needs dollars to maintain central bank reserves, is also trying to curb capital flight. ""I've just had one fixed term account in dollars for some time,"" President Fernandez said on Wednesday. ""And I've decided to put it in pesos, it's more profitable to have it in pesos."" Economic crises in Argentina's recent history mean many view the US dollar as a safe haven, and some keep part of their wealth outside the country. Savers also have memories of tight controls on bank withdrawals and a sharp devaluation of the currency. Last November, the government imposed new exchange controls. People wanting to buy dollars have to give their national identity and tax number, which must then be approved by the national tax agency (AFIP) before the transaction can go ahead. And this month further restrictions took effect. Argentines wanting to travel abroad must prove their money was obtained legally and tell the tax agency when and where they are going, and why. The government's measures have slowed capital flight which last year totalled more than $21bn (£13.5bn). But high inflation is eroding confidence in the peso, analysts say. And with more controls in place, Argentines are increasingly resorting to the informal currency market to obtain dollars.",Argentine President Cristina Fernandez says she is switching her personal savings from the US dollar to the Argentine peso.
"The secret station was manned by civilian volunteers who would send and receive messages for the Army. It was discovered in 2012 at a house just outside Norwich called Pinebanks. Complete with a fake bookcase to conceal the room and an escape tunnel, Historic England said it was a ""rare example."" By June 1940, the increasing threat of German invasion and potential occupation prompted Prime Minster Churchill to set up a secret mission called GHQ Auxiliary Units, with a particular branch known as ""Special Duties"". It used civilian volunteers, living in areas like the south-east of England and East Anglia seen as most under threat of invasion, to spy and report on German military activities, had the UK been invaded. Historic England said these recruits to ""Churchill's secret army"" transmitted messages from hidden ""Out-stations"" to military-run ""In stations"", like the one at Pinebanks. ""So much information about the stations was either hidden or destroyed,"" said Historic England's Tony Calladine. ""This small but significant dugout has great potential to teach us about a relatively little known area of our 20th Century military history."" Details about their locations and construction were kept secret and very little documentation on the 32 In stations exists. Only 12 In stations have been found so far and Historic England is asking the public for help in tracing the remaining 20. By July 1944, 3,500 civilians had been trained and 125 civilian-run Out stations had been established, often hidden in dugouts. Two other wireless stations are protected as ancient monuments - Hare Warren Control Station in Wiltshire and an Out station at Heiferlaw in Northumberland. The Pinebanks station is at Thorpe St Andrews near Norwich. It is not open to the public and was gutted by a fire in 2014.",An underground wireless station set up in 1940 by Winston Churchill to counteract a feared German invasion has been given heritage protection.
"Gavin HewittEurope editor@BBCGavinHewitton Twitter Photos had been taken from an apartment across the street. There were timings of his comings and goings. Even his secret service bodyguard was noted delivering the morning croissants. The magazine Closer has seven pages detailing the visits to the building in the affluent eighth arrondissement. The woman is Julie Gayet, a film actress and prominent supporter of Francois Hollande. She had gushed during the election campaign that ""he was humble and a really good listener"". The apartment is no more than 300m (984ft) from the Elysee Palace, but the need for secrecy involved the head of state putting on a helmet and riding on the back of a scooter. The president's office has reacted furiously. Francois Hollande, it is said, greatly deplores the invasion of his privacy, to which he has a right as any other French citizen. He is looking into the possibility of taking legal action. There was no denial of the story, however. Very few French politicians have commented. Those who have spoken only underline the right of every citizen to privacy. Later on Friday the managing editor of Closer, Laurence Pieau, said the magazine would remove from its website the feature about the Hollande-Gayet relationship, at the request of Julie Gayet's lawyers. No such request had been made concerning the print edition, she told AFP news agency, Restrained reaction What was interesting, on a brief visit to the street with the apartment, was the absence of media. French channels are wary of pursuing this story, in a country with strict laws on privacy. But the visit underlined a cultural difference between French and British society. A similar story in London would have led to the apartment being surrounded by reporters and cameras. A quick canvassing of street opinion was met by shrugs and the belief that the president was entitled to do what he likes. The fact that the president has a live-in partner, Valerie Trierweiler, is regarded as a private matter. In recent months there has been speculation that his relationship with The First Girlfriend - as the Americans like to call her - has been under increasing strain. Whatever the French attachment to privacy, however, there is a further risk to the president's authority. He has the lowest ratings of any president during the Fifth Republic. Although France seems to have eked out some growth in the final quarter of 2013, the economy hovers close to recession. Unemployment - which the president asked to be judged by - remains stubbornly high at 11%. The country is often referred to as the Sick Man of Europe and other Europeans - in particular the Germans - say that France under Mr Hollande has failed to carry out meaningful reforms to restore its economy's competitiveness. He campaigned as ""Mr Normal"" and there will be some who say his presidency lacks purpose, ambition and direction. That is a criticism, however, that cannot be applied to his handling of foreign affairs, where he has been bold and unafraid of using military intervention. To be fair, Mr Hollande has changed some labour laws, making it easier to hire and fire workers and to reduce their pay and working hours during a downturn. But business leaders want a reduction in taxes and wholesale reform of welfare entitlements. Privacy debate During the election campaign there was some criticism of the bad blood between Segolene Royal - his former partner and mother of his four children - and his current girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler. Some questioned why the president had not sorted out his private life before arriving in the Elysee Palace. Some of that criticism will resurface. His critics used to refer to him as ""Monsieur Flamby"", a wobbly pudding. Some of those remarks may be dusted down, too. But the French have a history of presidents with complicated private lives. President Mitterrand - Mr Hollande's mentor - had a secret family. However much the French defend privacy, Closer magazine was sold out at many newsstands. It remains to be seen what the French really make of their president's lifestyle after hours. Next Tuesday he gives his New Year press conference. It will be interesting whether he is asked about his alleged affair but, perhaps more importantly, whether he can relaunch his troubled presidency with some bold economic reforms.","This morning the French people were treated to dramatic pictures of their president, disguised by a black motorcycle helmet, being dropped off by scooter at the apartment of his alleged girlfriend."
"The policy has caused uproar internationally and was challenged by the acting US attorney general, whom Mr Trump then fired. Top Republican Paul Ryan said he regretted that some people with valid documents had been affected. But he also defended the ban, saying it aimed to prevent terror attacks. In international reaction: 'Not the best' Speaking at a news conference, the heads of the department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said 720 people had been detained and ""humanely processed"" since Mr Trump's executive order was issued. CBP chief Kevin McAleenan acknowledged that public and government communications had not been ""the best"" as the policy was rolled out. He also said that although the order had suspended the US refugee programme, 872 refugees had been granted waivers and were due to arrive in the US this week because they had been ready to travel and preventing them from doing so would have caused undue hardship. Homeland Security chief John Kelly denied that President Trump's order - which affects people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - amounted to a ban on Muslims and said the vast majority of the world's Muslims still had access to the US. The 90-day order, he argued, would give officials time to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the US immigration system, something which was ""long overdue"". ""Some of those countries may not be taken off the list any time soon,"" he said. ""They are countries that are in various states of collapse."" The US was also considering examining the web browsing history, mobile phone contacts and social media profiles of visa applicants from countries where there was little confidence in local law enforcement agencies, he said. Mr McAleenan offered some clarification on how dual citizens were affected, saying the US authorities would handle people based on the passport they were travelling on. Several governments - including the UK, Canada and Switzerland - have already said that their citizens who are also citizens of the seven countries affected by the ban are free to travel to the US. Mr Ryan said he was confident that the policy would now be ""done correctly"" and would impose the ""kind of vetting standards that we all want to see"". ""No-one wanted to see people with Green Cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this,"" he said. Many US officials remain critical of the policy, however. Hundreds of American diplomats sent a memo to the state department's leadership on Tuesday expressing dissent. ""A policy which closes our doors to over 200 million legitimate travelers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travelers who intend to harm Americans from using the visa system to enter the United States will not achieve its aim of making our country safer,"" they wrote. ""This ban stands in opposition to the core American and constitutional values that we, as federal employees, took an oath to uphold."" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said earlier officials could ""get with the programme or go"". The Saudi oil minister said travel restrictions after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 had affected thousands of Saudi Arabians but were later resolved and he expected the same to happen with Mr Trump's policy. He said he did not think Mr Trump would place restrictions on Saudis entering the US because tens of thousands of Saudi students were studying there. The fact that most of the 9/11 attackers were Saudis, he said, had been a deliberate attempt by former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to destroy the US-Saudi relationship. But the two governments had seen through the ploy, he added.",US security chiefs have admitted flaws in the way President Donald Trump's bar on people from seven countries entering the US was implemented.

So far, the scientists have released data they collected by scanning 40 babies a few days after birth. Lead investigator Prof David Edwards said getting permission from new parents to allow their babies to be scanned was ""a big ask"". ""It's perfectly safe. There's no radiation or X-rays involved. But we are incredibly grateful to the families who have taken part in this work. It's contributing hugely to science."" Their plan is to scan many more newborns, as well as babies still growing in the womb. Then they will create a dynamic map of human brain connectivity. Prof Edwards said: ""Having lots of data will mean we can study what is normal and abnormal in terms of brain development. ""We can start to answer important questions, like what happens to the brain when babies are born prematurely or how does the brain develop differently in children with autism."" The work, which is funded with a 14.9m euro European Research Council grant, will take a few more years to complete. When it is finished, the researchers say theirs will be the biggest and best-quality collection of baby brain development images ever gathered. A map of adult brain connections has already been made.

"Partnership plans are being considered by the executive of Reigate and Banstead Borough Council on Thursday. The agreement would see shared working in revenues, benefits, finance, information technology and personnel. Council leader Joan Spiers said the move could affect Reigate council jobs, but the authority would try to to minimise redundancies. She said the majority of Reigate council staff would continue to operate from Reigate Town Hall in the short term, but locations may change over time. Services which needed face-to-face contact would remain in the borough, she added. She said: ""If this way forward is agreed, clearly it will have an impact on the number of staff employed by the council. ""However, we would seek to minimise redundancies and redeploy staff where possible, including within the wider partnership."" Councillor Spiers said Reigate council needed to save £4m over the next few years, but the savings target was likely to increase. 'Impressive track record' Reigate had looked at alternative service delivery options and found that a partnership with Kent County Council would be the most cost-effective way of delivering some services. She said: ""Kent County Council has an impressive track record of these types of partnerships already. ""A partnership with them will mean that these services will remain in the public sector for the foreseeable future while we benefit from the economies of scale that a larger partner can bring."" If the plans go ahead, the partnership would be governed by a joint member board including councillors from both local authorities.",A Surrey council aiming to save £4m may team up with Kent County Council to deliver some services.
"By Secunder Kermani & Sami Yousafzai & Ishtiaq MehsudBBC News But then, the dead men had hoped to go unnoticed: according to one source, they were both carrying fake IDs. Exactly what they were doing in Kabul, and who killed them, remains a mystery that touches upon the murky links between security services and extremist groups in the region. Who they really were, at least, has become clear. According to sources in Pakistani intelligence and militant circles, the men were senior members of the Pakistani Taliban - a group that has killed hundreds of Pakistanis in suicide bombings and other attacks. One of the dead men was Sheikh Khalid Haqqani, who held a key position in the Pakistani Taliban's leadership council, and formerly served as the group's deputy leader. He had been accused of involvement in several high-profile attacks on Pakistani politicians and linked to one of the country's deadliest militant attacks, the 2014 assault on a school in Peshawar, which left more than 150 people - mainly children - dead. The second man was Qari Saif Younis, a military commander within the group. In a statement on Thursday, the Pakistani Taliban confirmed the men's identities and their deaths but gave few other details. According to one militant source, the men had been due to hold a secret ""meeting"" in Kabul, on the direct orders of the group's leadership, apparently travelling from the eastern Afghan province of Paktika. The militant would not say who they were meeting. According to a source in Pakistani intelligence, the men's bodies were discovered in the vicinity of the high-end Intercontinental Hotel - the site of two deadly attacks in recent years. The deaths occurred last week, but the source in the Pakistani Taliban said the group's leadership had initially ordered the news to be kept ""secret"", partly as they were rattled by the assassinations, and partly to avoid awkward questions about why the men were in the city. It is highly unusual for senior members of the Pakistani Taliban to be travelling to Kabul. The group is an entirely separate entity from the Afghan Taliban, with different aims and different supporters. The Afghan Taliban have been fighting a long-running insurgency against the Afghan government, which is backed by US-led forces, while the Pakistani Taliban have focused their attacks inside Pakistan. Pakistan has long been accused of sponsoring the Afghan Taliban, and providing them sanctuary within the country. It's alleged Afghan intelligence services developed links with the Pakistani Taliban in response. The group, which has been severely weakened in recent years, is now based in the east of Afghanistan, in areas out of the control of the country's government. Both countries deny supporting militant groups. The statement from the Pakistani Taliban said the men were killed in a clash with American forces. The US has been holding discussions with the Afghan Taliban, aimed at bringing an end to the 18-year insurgency. Pakistan is believed to be key in helping persuade the group to reach a negotiated settlement. The source within the group acknowledged it was also possible that gunmen or militants linked to Pakistani intelligence services were responsible. They have in the past conducted other audacious assassinations, targeting figures wanted by Pakistan who were living in Afghanistan. For example, in December 2018 a suicide bombing in an upmarket district of the southern city of Kandahar killed a separatist Pakistani leader who had been living there in exile. Conversely, figures linked to the Afghan Taliban have previously been killed in Pakistan. In 2013, one alleged senior Afghan militant figure was shot dead in a bakery in Islamabad. According to sources within the Pakistani Taliban, the bodies of the men killed in Kabul, Sheikh Khalid Haqqani and Qari Saif Younis, were handed over to the group, and a large funeral was held for them on Monday in their stronghold in eastern Kunar Province. Of course, how the bodies ended up back in the hands of their militant group remains another part of the intrigue.",The fatal shooting of two men in the heart of the Afghan capital Kabul - a city unfortunately used to violence - went almost unnoticed.
"Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were shown images said to be of Adam Thomas, 22. Another photo showed him holding a swastika flag alongside his partner and baby. Mr Thomas, along with partner Claudia Patatas, 38 and Daniel Bogunovic, 27, denies being a member of banned far-right group National Action. Prosecuting, Barnaby Jameson QC said the photos were from the ""Thomas-Patatas family album"". Mr Jameson said one image, found on a memory card at the house, shows Ms Patatas holding her baby, standing next to another man holding a swastika flag and performing a Nazi-style salute. Describing another image, said to show Mr Thomas in the hooded robe with his child, he said: ""The suggestion is that is Mr Thomas and his child, whose middle name is Adolf."" Turning to an image of a hooded man with a machete, Mr Jameson added: ""There is a strong inference, and you'll appreciate this when you look inside the Thomas and Patatas house, that that was taken inside their home, and that the person in the robes was Thomas."" The couple gave their child the middle name Adolf, which the prosecution allege was in honour of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Mr Thomas and Ms Patatas, of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, Oxfordshire, are on trial accused of being members of National Action, which was banned under terrorism laws in December 2016. Axe and knives Co-defendant Mr Bogunovic, of Crown Hills Rise, Leicester, is facing the same charge. A host of Nazi and far-right memorabilia, and National Action flags, badges and banners, were found at the couple's home, the court has heard, as well as an ""extensive"" collection of weapons, including crossbows, an axe and knives. Two cushions bearing the swastika were found during police searches of the house after their arrest for alleged terrorism offences in January, the court was told.

"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter It comes as a vote on Theresa May's Brexit plan was called off, so she could seek assurances from Brussels over the Irish border backstop. But the EU has insisted the deal is ""not up for renegotiation"". Mrs May will travel to Dublin on Wednesday to meet Leo Varadkar. The prime minister has already been holding talks with other European leaders and EU officials in a bid to rescue her Brexit deal. Mrs May is expected to meet DUP leader Arlene Foster on Wednesday before heading to Dublin. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The backstop is the insurance policy arrangement aimed at avoiding a return to a hard border - physical checkpoints or infrastructure - along the 310-mile (500-km) border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. The Irish government has said there can be no deal without it, and has received support from other EU leaders. Mrs Foster has said the Irish border backstop should be taken out of the EU withdrawal deal and put into the political declaration between the EU and UK, which is not legally binding and covers potential future relations. It has faced a backlash from Labour and other opposition parties, and the DUP - which backs the government in a confidence-and-supply pact - but says it will not back the deal unless there is ""radical surgery"" to amend its terms. If it took effect, it would see Northern Ireland only remain aligned with the EU single market in some areas, meaning new regulatory barriers between GB and NI. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Mrs May is understood to be seeking legal guarantees that the UK will not be trapped in the Northern Ireland backstop plan indefinitely. What is the Irish government saying? On Tuesday, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney gave a paper to cabinet colleagues outlining the government's preparations for a no-deal outcome. Mr Varadkar said the government now needs to up its contingency planning to execution for a no-deal scenario in terms of recruitment of customs, veterinary and health officers at Irish ports. ""It means putting in place infrastructure at our ports and airports, in Dublin and Rosslare,"" he said. ""Firms who don't have action plans should develop action plans, and those who have action plans should begin to implement them."" How have other parties responded? Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said she had made it clear to Theresa May that it would be ""incumbent"" on the British government to hold a border poll, if the UK left the EU without a deal. Her party is one of four pro-remain parties in Northern Ireland backing the deal, and has urged the UK to ""bank the backstop"". But she put it to Mr Varadkar that it was ""time"" for the Irish government to articulate the same position as Sinn Féin, in supporting a border poll, if no deal could be reached. Border poll call 'disruptive' ""The fact is uniting our country would end the need for a backstop."" But Mr Varadkar said he disagreed with her assessment, and that he would be working to give the UK ""assurances"", but never compromising on its commitments on the border. ""If I didn't know you better I would almost think you wanted a no-deal scenario... so you could stir up trouble,"" he said to Ms McDonald. ""By introducing demands for a border poll at this time, they are are disruptive and destructive to what we want to try and achieve."" He said the UK could still withdraw the threat of no deal by revoking Article 50 or extending it. What have other MPs opposed to the backstop said? Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused Mr Varadkar of ""playing a game"" with the backstop. He told BBC News that Mrs May should be telling the EU27 that the backstop is ""intolerable"". ""The EU knows it and so does Mr Varadkar, but he's playing a game for Irish politics and that needs to stop. The UK has to say to them [EU27 leaders]: 'You're putting at risk your own settlement if you don't agree something.'"" What is the EU saying? In Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said there was ""no room whatsoever"" for renegotiation. He said the EU could give further clarification but that the withdrawal agreement, in all its parts including the backstop, would not be reopened. Mr Juncker said the backstop was ""necessary"" for the entire coherence of the agreement and it was necessary for the Republic of Ireland. ""Ireland will never be left alone,"" he added. How has this played into the Stormont stalemate? Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government for almost two years, after a row between the DUP and Sinn Féin over a flawed green energy scheme. They are the two largest parties, which have to share power at Stormont due to structures set out in the Good Friday peace Agreement, but their opposite stances on Brexit have further strained relations. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major criticised the political breakdown during a speech he made at an event in Dublin on Tuesday. He told the Institute of International and European Affairs that Brexit had ""inserted its very own poison into the turbulent politics of Northern Ireland"". He also said the government was ""hindered"" in its attempts to restore power sharing at Stormont, due to the confidence-and-supply pact it signed up to with the DUP after last year's general election. The remarks came a day after he accused unionists opposing the backstop in the withdrawal agreement of ""breathtaking ignorance"". What happens now? A summit of EU leaders is still due to take place this Thursday. Meanwhile, Downing Street has said a Commons vote will be held on the deal before 21 January.","The Republic of Ireland needs to up its contingency plans for the potential of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has said."

In a statement a spokeswoman said it was informed the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah would be returning his degree after it wrote to him last month. More than 118,500 people have signed a petition calling on the university to rescind the honorary law degree, which was awarded in 1993. Oxford MP Layla Moran also wrote to the university urging it to strip him of the degree, and said it being returned was ""clearly not sufficient"". She said: ""Oxford University now has a chance to redeem itself and move past being tied to such gross violations of human rights. ""I think it is best the university should undertake a thorough review of their honorary degree system to ensure a scandal like this doesn't happen again."" Previously the university said: ""Just as nobody has a right to confer an honorary degree, nobody has a right summarily to rescind it."" The Sultan has defended the decision to adopt a strict new interpretation of Islamic laws, or Sharia. In a speech he said although there would be a moratorium on the death penalty, the ""merit"" of the new laws would eventually become clear.

"The Trussell Trust said it had given emergency food aid to nearly 80,000 people in Wales in the last 12 months, more than double the 2012-13 figure. Archbishop Barry Morgan said it was ""incredible"" for this to happen in such a ""prosperous country"". More than 500 clergy signed a letter as part of the End Hunger Fast campaign. The Church in Wales said the letter, backed by more than 40 bishops, marked the biggest ever intervention by faith leaders on the issue of UK food poverty in modern times. The Trussell Trust, which helps people referred to its food banks by social workers or other professionals, said the number of people receiving three days of emergency food and support from its food banks in Wales had risen by 120% in a year, after doubling the previous year. The number of people it helped across the UK rose by 160% to 913,138, the trust added, while the number of food banks it ran rose by 45%. Dr Morgan said: ""It is incredible that in a prosperous country like ours, where we are told the economy is improving and house prices are rising, that nearly a million people feel the need to visit food banks to feed their families. ""Surely the mark of a civilised society is how it treats its poorest and most vulnerable people."" 'Fundamental questions' The Bishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron, who also signed the letter along with the Bishop of Bangor, Andy John, added: ""There have been attempts to portray the End Hunger Fast campaign in one form or another as 'loony lefties attack nasty right'. ""This is not political point scoring, it is addressing fundamental questions of well being for our citizens."" Trussell Trust chairman Chris Mould said: ""That 79,049 people in Wales have received three days' food from a food bank, over double the numbers helped last year, is shocking in 21st Century Britain. ""But perhaps most worrying of all this figure is just the tip of the iceberg of UK food poverty - it doesn't include those helped by other emergency food providers, those living in towns where there is no food bank, people who are too ashamed to seek help or the large number of people who are only just coping by eating less and buying cheap food."" Copies of the letter will be delivered to the constituency offices of the three main UK party leaders by three religious figures who have been fasting for 40 days over Easter and Lent. 'Fewer struggling' A UK government spokesperson questioned whether the Trussell Trust's figures took account of return visits and defended welfare reforms, saying a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found the proportion of UK residents finding it difficult to afford food had fallen from 9.8% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2012. ""We're spending £94bn a year on working age benefits so that the welfare system provides a safety net to millions of people who are on low incomes or unemployed so they can meet their basic needs,"" said the spokesperson. ""Even the OECD say there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago, benefit processing times are improving and even the Trussell Trust's own research recognises the effect their marketing activity has on the growth of their business. ""The truth is that the employment rate is the highest it's been for five years and our reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities by promoting work and helping people to lift themselves out of poverty.""",The Archbishop of Wales has urged the UK government to tackle a national hunger crisis as figures show a big rise in numbers using foodbanks.
"In a post about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that resurfaced this week, Kamau Bobb also claimed Jewish people had an ""insensitivity"" to suffering. The post has now been deleted. On Thursday, a spokesperson for Google told the BBC that Mr Bobb would ""no longer be part of our diversity team going forward"". ""We unequivocally condemn the past writings by a member of our diversity team that are causing deep offence and pain to members of our Jewish community,"" they said. ""These writings are unquestionably hurtful. The author acknowledges this and has apologised. He will no longer be part of our diversity team... and will focus on his Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] work. ""This has come at at a time where we've seen an alarming increase in anti-Semitic attacks,"" the spokesperson added. ""Anti-Semitism... has no place in society and we stand with our Jewish community in condemning it."" Mr Bobb - who joined Google in 2018 - has apologised to staff for the blog post. What did the blog post say? In the 2007 post titled If I were a Jew, Mr Bobb described how he believed Jewish people should feel about the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the Times of Israel reports. ""If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defence of myself,"" he wrote. ""Self-defence is undoubtedly an instinct, but I would be afraid of my increasing insensitivity to the suffering [of] others."" When the post resurfaced, campaigners were quick to call for Mr Bobb's resignation. Michael Dickson, head of the pro-Israel organisation Stand With Us, tweeted that the blog made ""revolting, and anti-Semitic, comparisons between Nazi actions and that of the world's only Jewish country"". The US-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, meanwhile, also called for Mr Bobb to be removed from his post. Mr Bobb has not publicly responded to the criticism. However, according to the New York Post, he emailed the Jewish staff group at Google to apologise. ""What I wrote crudely characterised the entire Jewish community. What was intended as a critique of particular military action fed into anti-Semitic tropes and prejudice,"" he reportedly wrote in the email. ""I think we can all agree, there is no easy solution to this situation. But that's beside the point,"" he added. ""The way I expressed my views on that conflict were hurtful.""

"Hull Maritime Museum is preparing to put exhibits into storage prior to a major refurbishment. It has found a leaf from The Golden Legend, printed by William Caxton in 1498. It is believed to have been acquired by the museum during the the 1930s or 1940s. The Golden Legend records the lives of saints and was originally written in Latin by Jacobus de Varagine in 1290. The museum's double-sided extract includes The Lyf of Saynt Brandon and The Lyf of Saynt Dorothee. St Brendan, sometimes known as Brendan the Navigator, has been credited by some with long sea voyages, even as far as North America, during the 6th Century. A note on the paper reads: ""This leaf of William Caxton's Golden Legende (his translation of Jacobus de Voraginus Leganda aurea) was accomplyshed and fynyshed at Westmynster at Caxton's own printing press by Wynlyn de Worde in 1498."" Robin Diaper, a curator at the museum, said: ""This significant page is extremely fragile but a fine example of what we hold in store."" Caxton established a press in London at Westminster in 1476, the first in England. He printed more than 100 books and translated many of them himself, he died in 1492.

"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is among the 40 people who will have their assets frozen, and Canadians will be banned from doing business with them. Canada's foreign minister said the country ""will not stand by silently"" amid the country's ongoing crisis. The move follows a similar action by the United States in August. Venezuela has been hit by waves of anti-government protests this year in which more than a hundred people have been killed. US economic sanctions targeting the government were imposed after the formation of a controversial constituent's assembly at the start of last month. The assembly is filled with pro-government supporters and has assumed the powers of the opposition-held parliament. Critics say the body is a way for President Maduro to cling to power, and the US, EU, and many Latin American countries do not recognise it. Canada said the 40 people targeted by its sanctions were ""the people responsible for the deterioration of democracy"" and warned of Venezuela's ""deepening descent into dictatorship"". As well as President Maduro, the named figures include Vice-President Tareck El Aissami and the head of the constituent assembly, Delcy Rodriguez. ""Today's announcement of sanctions against the Maduro regime underscores our commitment to defending democracy and human rights around the world,"" said Chrystia Freeland, Canada's foreign affairs minister. ""Canada stands in solidarity with the people of Venezuela as they struggle to restore democracy in their country."" Ms Freeland told Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper she would be hosting a meeting of the Lima group - a bloc of 12 countries focusing on the crisis - in the next 60 days.

"In 2019, the company launched a trade-up scheme that offered existing owners 30% off the cost of a new speaker. But owners had to activate ""Recycle Mode"" on their existing Sonos speaker, making it permanently unusable - even if there was nothing wrong with it. Sonos said it had now removed the requirement from its scheme. Activating Recycle Mode starts an irreversible process that wipes personal data from the device - but also stops the internet-connected speaker working. The company was criticised for encouraging people to disable speakers that had nothing wrong with them. Sonos said the policy was to ""encourage responsible disposal of older devices"". But critics said it would be much more environmentally friendly to let people sell their old speakers or donate them to family, friends or charity shops. ""The concept of trading in old Sonos speakers is brilliant, but just bricking it and asking you to send to a recycling centre doesn't make any sense,"" said Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. The process of ruining gadgets and making them inoperable is known as ""bricking"", because it makes the device about as useful as a brick in technology terms. Sonos said people could now apply for the upgrade discount just by registering the serial number of their existing speaker. ""We also respect the customer's right to decide for themselves when a product has reached the end of its useful life. So, while we are fully committed to supporting customers that wish to recycle their old hardware, we removed the Recycle Mode requirement from the program,"" the company said in a statement. ""Customers still receive a 30% discount on new Sonos products, but they can now choose what to do with their old device - continue to use it, give it to a friend, donate it to charity, responsibly recycle it at their local e-waste facility or send it back to Sonos via a prepaid shipping label."" Last year, the company also faced criticism after announcing it would no longer release software updates for some of its older speakers. The change affected four models sold between 2006 and 2015. It said it had to make the change because older hardware would not be able to support the new software.","Sonos will no longer make people ""brick"" - or permanently deactivate - their smart speakers in order to take advantage of a discount upgrade offer."

The new collaboration developed out of a friendship between Sheeran and Lowden. At his gig at Belfast's Boucher Road Playing Fields last May, Sheeran told 40,000 fans about his love for Lowden instruments. One of Lowden's most popular guitars, the Wee Lowden, was designed in 2013 by the firm's founder George Lowden at the request of Snow Patrol front man Gary Lightbody as a gift for Sheeran. Lowden honoured ""We have been honoured over the past years that Ed has chosen to play Lowden guitars both on-stage and in the studio,"" said Mr Lowden. ""We are delighted to have established a close ongoing relationship which has borne fruit recently through the birth of Sheeran by Lowden."" Lowden Guitars dates back to 1961 when George started making the instruments with his boat builder father using fishing line for strings. He opened his first workshop in Bangor, Co Down, in 1977. Lowden guitars are now sold across the world.",Ed Sheeran is teaming up with a County Down guitar firm to make affordable quality guitars in the hope of tempting more young people to play music.
"By Jordan DaviesBBC News Harry was 17 when he was ""ruthlessly hunted down"" and ""repeatedly stabbed"" in the summer of 2019. He had been ""ambushed"" by ""rival"" drug dealers - including a 17-year-old boy - in the Vale of Glamorgan town of Barry. Harry was cornered and killed in a locked shipping container yard. Following the conviction of seven defendants for murder and manslaughter, the head of one substance misuse organisation said the teenager's death should prompt a review into how effective services in Wales have been at preventing harm caused by illegal drugs. Drugs workers also said the pandemic was making it harder to identify these issues. Harry Baker's death was a product of dangerous drug dealers establishing a foothold in the seaside town, and in their vulnerable customers' lives. He was from Cardiff and had emerged as a drug dealer in Barry shortly before he was killed. The trial heard ""general"" text messages were sent from his phone in the days before his death, ""advertising"" his drugs. These caught the attention of drug users, and established drug dealers who were angry Harry ""had come onto their turf"", stealing their ""lucrative business"". The court heard Harry Baker was eventually ""ambushed"" by a ""raiding party"" on a street in Barry, where his masked killers and their victim were ""jousting"" with knives. Harry was then chased for a mile to the docks. Jurors were shown footage of his killers scaling the gates of a locked compound, passing weapons to each other. Less than two minutes later they were strolling back through the yard having stabbed the 17-year-old nine times, prosecutor Paul Lewis QC said. But why was he killed so mercilessly? The trial painted a picture of drug dealers, known locally as ""shotters"", armed and vying for territory and trade. Defendants Leon Symons, 23 from Cardiff and a 17-year old who cannot be identified because of his age, targeted Barry as a place where they could expand their trade in heroin and crack cocaine. They were both convicted of murder, along with Leon Clifford, 23 and Peter McCarthy, 37. Raymond Thompson, 48, Ryan Palmer, 34, and Lewis Evans, 62, were all found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Newport Crown Court. Drugs workers say this is happening across the country, but particularly in towns with good transport links to major cities, sometimes known as county lines. The trial heard some of the drug-dealing defendants had befriended and stayed in the homes of their drug-using co-defendants, exploiting their vulnerabilities and encouraging them to commit acts of crime and violence. Jurors were told Leon Symons and his 17-year old co-defendant befriended and stayed in the home of Evans, who was described as a ""pitiful"" cocaine addict who used drugs to forget his experiences in the Falklands War. However, Jim Henton, a senior substance misuse worker responsible for projects across Wales, including Barry, said the pandemic had made it more difficult to identify who was being exploited and controlled, because outreach work and face-to-face contact had been scaled back. She said: ""Lots of services aren't doing outreach, they aren't going out to the community any more, they're not going into home visits. ""Appointments have been stopped, people aren't coming into treatment services, they're not out on the streets."" Ms Henton also said it was harder to ""keep an eye"" on vulnerable service users. ""It's hard for us to catch any change in their behaviour, any change in their drugs use,"" she added. ""Any change in their physical appearance that might tell us that there's something going on in their home life - and that they're either being pressured or they're being controlled in those acts."" All of the defendants in the trial were involved in Class A drugs: heroin and crack cocaine. Hardened drug dealer Leon Symons had previous convictions for carrying weapons, including shooting one of his victims in the head with a pellet gun. Leon Clifford had been dealing heroin and crack cocaine in Barry for years. He said that after stabbing Harry Baker, he weighed down his clothes with a brick and threw them into the water near Barry Island. Review call Martin Blakebrough, the head of the substance misuse organisation Kaleidoscope, believes Harry Baker's death should now prompt politicians and practitioners to review how effective services in Wales have been at preventing harm caused by Class A drugs. He said: ""I would hope that people look at what has happened in this horrific situation, and in a sense try and go backwards, in terms of 'OK, so what happened to this lad to get involved in drugs?' ""'What happened actually to the gang that were involved in drugs? What could have been done better?' So it's sort of trying to go back to first steps."" Mr Blakebrough added: ""I think with any tragedy we have to take stock and go: 'Is there anything we could have done better?' And I think the reality is yes - you definitely could.""","The last moments of Harry Baker's short life were captured on CCTV cameras - tired and terrified - desperately fleeing his baying pursuers, knives glinting in their hands."
"Dave Hartnett, who was head of tax at HM Revenue & Customs, said: ""I'd always expected there to be be more."" Mr Hartnett, who left HMRC in 2012, was giving evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee. HSBC has come under fire over what it knew about some clients' tax affairs. Details of some 30,000 accounts at HSBC's Geneva-based private bank were leaked to the French authorities by a whistleblower, Herve Falciani, in 2007. Information about 3,600 UK account holders were passed to HMRC. Both HSBC and HMRC have been accused of not doing enough to investigate if these accounts were held for the purposes of tax evasion rather than legitimate avoidance. Mr Hartnett told the committee: ""I'd like to understand why there weren't more criminal prosecutions. I'd always expected there to be more. I'd have liked to understand what would have happened if more resources were diverted to [investigating the leaked details]."" 'Been diligent' He said there were discussions with the French authorities before the leaked information was passed to the UK, and there were also discussions with HSBC. But he never got involved in the detail, ""to pressure the integrity of the investigations taking place"". But HMRC tax assurance commissioner Edward Troup insisted that his department had been ""diligent"" in pursuing the information received from the French. ""I don't think there is anything... which suggests that we have not been diligent,"" he told the committee. ""We have collected £135m. We believe we have collected all the tax, all the interest, and a significant amount of penalties."" Mr Hartnett now works for HSBC. He said that he had followed the rules for former senior officials on taking appointments outside the civil service ""to the letter"". He said: ""Colleagues checked it, the Cabinet Office checked it, the committee checked it, it went to the Prime Minister, and the Financial Conduct Authority also had to approve my appointment.""","A former senior tax official has expressed ""surprise"" that just one person has been prosecuted in the UK over alleged tax evasion by clients of HSBC's Swiss banking division."
"Here's a who's who of the people pictured, and where they stand on the trade row that defined the summit. 1. Donald Trump, US president Mr Trump shocked America's allies - namely the EU, Mexico and Canada - when he recently announced a 25% tariff on imports of steel and 10% on aluminium from these countries. They are all threatening retaliatory measures and the rift overshadowed the summit, leaving the American president isolated at times. Mr Trump departed before the other leaders, and complained that America was ""like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing"". He then tore into Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in a pair of tweets, calling him ""very dishonest and weak"" and attacking his ""false statements"" after Mr Trudeau reasserted his strong opposition to the US tariffs in a news conference. 2. John Bolton, US national security adviser It's been just three months since he was appointed President Trump's top security adviser but John Bolton has already made an impact. One of the president's arguments for the tariffs is on ""national security grounds"" - a view Mr Bolton has stridently backed. 3. Kazuyuki Yamazaki, Japanese senior deputy minister for foreign affairs Promoted to the post in July 2017, he recently led a Japanese delegation to Pakistan and took part in joint talks between Japan, China and South Korea in Seoul about a proposed free trade agreement. Read more on the G7 summit: 4. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister He has come under increased pressure to join retaliatory measures against America's tariffs. This puts him in a difficult position - he has tried hard to cultivate a warm relationship with President Trump and the two are said to have met at least 10 times since he was elected to the White House. 5. Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary The MP from Japan's governing party once worked in the ministry of international trade and industry. 6. Angela Merkel, German chancellor She has been at the forefront of talks to try to resolve differences at the summit, as is clear in this photo. Mrs Merkel apparently floated an idea to set up a mechanism to resolve trade disputes between the US and its allies on Friday. Asked during the summit about her relationship with President Trump, Mrs Merkel said the two leaders did not always agree but could talk to each other: ""I can say that I maintain a very open and direct relationship with the American president."" 7. Emmanuel Macron, French president He engaged in a Twitter spat with President Trump over the tariffs hours before the summit - leading some to question whether the blossoming ""bromance"" between the two was over. Despite this, they were seen to be on good terms, and President Macron's team said his talks with Trump were ""frank and robust"". However, following Mr Trump's online outburst against Mr Trudeau, the French president issued a statement that ""international co-operation cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks"". 8. Theresa May, UK prime minister In a telephone call last week, she told President Trump she found the US tariffs ""unjustified and deeply disappointing"". But she also struck a more conciliatory tone at the summit, urging fellow leaders to step back from the brink of a possible trade war. 9. Larry Kudlow, director of the US National Economic Council Mr Trump's top economic adviser has defended the new tariffs and said his boss should not be blamed for trade tensions. After the summit, Mr Kudlow told CNN that the president and his team had gone to the summit ""in good faith"" but that Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" in his news conference. French President Macron tweeted an image taken at about the same time as the photo, but from a different angle, showing just how densely packed the G7 leaders and their assistants were as they gathered around President Trump. And another photo taken by Mr Trudeau's official photographer Adam Scotti shows a slightly happier scene, with Mrs Merkel smiling with Mr Trump and Mr Trudeau seeming to laugh. Mrs Merkel's photo has taken off on social media, spawning all sorts of memes and funny caption contests. The posture and confident body language of the powerful German leader were highlighted by many on Twitter, who said it was reminiscent of a schoolteacher telling off a naughty student (President Trump). The US correspondent for Germany's T-Online website, Fabian Reinbold, noted how different versions of the same moment were captured by several photographers: And the strong body language on show was not lost on many: Finally, some took a (somewhat humorous) guess at what was actually being said:",Awkward moments were expected at the G7 summit and an Instagram post from the official account of German Chancellor Angela Merkel appears to have captured one of them.
"There was some respite on Thursday but forecasters warn that an incoming storm from the Atlantic could be even worse than Wednesday's severe weather. Sixteen severe flood warnings remain for Berkshire, Surrey and Somerset - all already hit by severe flooding. Train services in parts of the UK are cancelled and some roads are closed. It comes after parts of the transport network struggled to cope during Wednesday's severe weather, which closed roads and caused delays and cancellations to rail services. In the Commons, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said £61m would be spent to help repair the damage - but Labour said at least £118m was needed for rail repairs alone. UK storms and floods 5,800 homes flooded since December 130,000 homes lost power overnight Wednesday 112mph wind gusts recorded 319mm rain fallen in Thames Valley since mid-December Wettest January since 1776 In other developments: Power out Travel Check if this is affecting your journey Gusts of up to 112mph were recorded on Wednesday, with Wales bearing the brunt of the hurricane-force winds, but a rare ""red warning"" for wind is no longer in place. The Energy Networks Association, representing UK energy companies, said about 80,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity. The organisation's spokesman, Tim Field, said 60,000 were without power across Wales, while the remainder were spread across northern and south-west England and the West Midlands. He said engineers had restored power to 145,000 customers since the storms hit on Wednesday, with 68,000 restored overnight. ""The pylons and the wires themselves are very resilient to strong winds. It is other airborne objects and debris - like uprooted trees - that cannot hold on in those sorts of 100mph winds. It is these things that are causing power lines to come down,"" he said. Engineers will work throughout the day to try to restore power by this evening to those customers still without, he added. Mark Bradshaw, of East Ilsley, Berkshire, said he had experienced three power cuts in 12 hours. ""With a seven-week-old baby, we are really worried that we cannot heat or sterilise her bottles as we have no gas,"" he said. Travel problems include the following: Hundreds of passengers on an East Coast main line train from Kings Cross to Edinburgh spent several hours stranded in north Yorkshire on Wednesday night after it lost power in the high winds. Sophie Cunningham was on another train which was stuck in the area for five hours and said emergency heating and lighting lasted for just 30 minutes. She described the situation as ""grim"", saying it was ""ice cold"" and ""like standing on the side of the track without the window"". The Met Office has issued various yellow ""be aware"" rain, wind, ice and snow warnings for many parts of the UK on Thursday. And BBC Weather's John Hammond warned the incoming storm from the Atlantic on Friday will be ""every bit as intense, if not more"" than Wednesday's. ""It looks like being the wettest winter on record and the groundwater has got nowhere to go. The ground is like a sponge, the sponge is full to overflowing. What we don't need is more rain. [But] what we're going to get is another storm."" Snow expected Forecasters are also warning of the possibility of significant snowfall in Northern Ireland, southern Scotland and northern England on Friday. As well as 16 severe flood warnings, the Environment Agency has also issued about 360 less serious flood warnings and alerts, mostly in southern England and the Midlands. Hundreds of members of the armed forces are continuing to help those affected by the flooding and 2,000 remain ready to help. Environment Agency programme director Toby Willison said many rivers in southern England were at their highest recorded levels. ""This is an exceptional event, it was the highest rainfall in January since 1776 and we think it is likely December, January and February will be the highest for 250 years,"" he added.",Tens of thousands of homes are without power and there is renewed travel disruption after hurricane-force winds battered the UK on Wednesday.
"Jorge Glas is the highest-ranking politician to be convicted in the scandal that has spread across Latin America and further afield. Prosecutors said he took $13.5m (£10.2m) in bribes. The president had removed his duties from him, and he had been in preventative custody since October. The company routinely gave bribes to win business, particularly in government contracts. It has admitted to paying $788m in bribes across 12 countries. Glas was arrested on 2 October. Vice-president since 2013, he was re-elected to the post in February. But with corruption allegations mounting against him, he was relieved of his duties by President Lenín Moreno in August. As part of a plea deal, former top Odebrecht executive in Ecuador Jose Conceicao Santos revealed that the company had paid $33.5m in bribes since 2007 to secure infrastructure contracts in the country. Prosecutors said Glas took payments via his uncle, Ricardo Rivera, who is one of four other people also sentenced to six years. Glas's lawyer said the sentence was ""wicked"" and ""barbaric"". Former President Rafael Correa, who appointed him, has previously said he believes the case is politically motivated. The sentences will not take effect until confirmed by the court, and the defendants also have the chance to appeal. The scandal has tainted politicians in several other countries, including Mexico, Peru and Panama as well as Brazil, where Odebrecht is based.",The vice-president of Ecuador has been sentenced to six years in jail in connection with corruption at the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.

"Paul will go back to his old job ""making children laugh"", a spokeswoman for the German aquarium said. The octopus correctly predicted the outcomes of all seven of Germany's games plus the Spain-Netherlands final. As a reward, aquarium staff presented him with his very own replica World Cup trophy garnished with his favourite food - mussels. Tanja Munzig, of the Sea Life Aquarium in the western German city of Oberhausen, said they had received offers for Paul but he was not for sale. ""There are a lot of offers for Paul from betting offices and other areas. One thing is clear: Paul is staying with us,"" she said. She added he would now ""step back from the official oracle business"". ""He won't give any more oracle predictions - either in football, or in politics, lifestyle or economy. Paul will get back to his former job, namely making children laugh."" Paul made his uncanny predictions for each game by choosing a mussel from one of two jars bearing the flags of World Cup opponents. The two-year-old cephalopod quickly became a worldwide celebrity. Seemingly unimpressed with his star status, Paul at first ignored the golden trophy - adorned with three mussels - placed in his tank. But after several minutes he finally picked off a mussel and devoured it in front of TV cameras.","An octopus credited with psychic powers is to retire from making predictions following his World Cup success, his owners say."
"The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit banned the group from ""physically attacking any vessel engaged by the plaintiffs"". The court was responding to an appeal by Japan's whalers, after an earlier case was rejected. The injunction remains in force until the court formally rules on the appeal. The ruling by the court also bans Sea Shepherd from ""navigating in a manner that is likely to endanger the safe navigation"" of any whaling vessel. Whaling clashes Every year, vessels from the US-based Sea Shepherd follow the Japanese whaling fleet south to try and disrupt its activities. Numerous collisions, clashes and boardings have occurred in the past, with each side blaming the other for aggressive tactics. The group was founded by Paul Watson, who is wanted by Interpol after skipping bail in Germany. He is accused of endangering the crew of a Costa Rican ship that was fishing for sharks in 2002. He is currently on a Sea Shepherd vessel preparing to pursue the Japanese fleet. Japan's fleet sails to the Antarctic in the autumn or winter each year, returning the following spring. There has been a ban on commercial whaling for 25 years, but Japan catches about 1,000 whales each year in what it says is a scientific research programme. Critics say it is commercial whaling in another guise. Australia and New Zealand are pursuing a legal case against Japan in international courts. Last year Japan cut short its whaling season - a move attributed to the harassment by Sea Shepherd. Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, which oversees whaling, welcome the court's move. But Sea Shepherd vowed to continue its activities, questioning the legality of the ruling. ""It is a complex situation whereby a United States court is issuing an injunction against Dutch and Australian vessels carrying an international crew, operating out of Australia and New Zealand in international waters,"" it said in a statement on its website.",A US court has ordered conservation group Sea Shepherd to stay at least 500 yards away from Japan's whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean.

"The changes involve different measures for ranking sites and people checking results are accurate. In a blog, Google said the changes should thwart attempts to abuse its algorithms that let extremists promote their content. Google was criticised last year for giving prominence to groups seeking to deny that the Holocaust took place. Rate and replace Ben Gomes, a vice-president of engineering at Google's search division, said it was making ""structural"" changes to tackle the new ways people had found to trick its algorithms. In particular, he said, many groups and organisations were using ""fake news"" to help spread ""blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information"". To combat this, he said, Google had added new metrics to its ranking systems that should help to stop false information entering the top results for particular search terms. In addition, he said, it had updated the guidelines given to the thousands of human raters it used to give feedback on whether results were accurate. The guidelines included examples of low quality and fake news websites, said Mr Gomes, to help them pick out ""misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories"". Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Google has done its best to play down the extent of fake news and hateful material - or what it prefers to call ""low quality content"" - in search results. The company keeps repeating that this affects only 0.25% of queries. But the fact that searches such as ""Is Obama planning a coup?"" - or even ""Who invented stairs?"" - produced such questionable results meant it had to act. These searches threw up a prominent ""snippets"" box telling you that, yes, President Obama was planning a coup, or that stairs had been invented in 1948. Now both boxes have gone, and Google's almighty algorithm has been tweaked so that such content is less likely to rise to the top. What's interesting is that a company that has put such faith in technology solutions is turning to 10,000 humans to try to make search a better experience. This giant focus group, which tests out changes in the search algorithm, has been told to pay more attention to the source of any pages rated highly in results, looking round the web to see whether they seem authoritative and trustworthy. Questions are bound to be raised about whether this panel, which Google says is representative of its users, is impartial and objective. Google's Ben Gomes, a veteran who's been wrestling with the intricacies of search since arriving as one of the earliest employees, believes it is now on the path to getting this right. But with so many people trying to game the system, the battle to make search true and fair will never be over. Google also planned to change its ""autocomplete"" tool, which suggests search terms, to allow users to more easily to flag up troubling content, he said. Danny Sullivan, founder of the Search Engine Land news site, said the changes made sense and should not be taken to suggest that Google's algorithms were failing to correctly index what they found online. ""It's sort of like saying that a restaurant is a failure if it asks for people to rate the food it makes,"" he said. ""The raters don't rank results,"" said Mr Sullivan. ""They simply give feedback about whether the results are good. ""That feedback is then used to reshape the algorithms - the recipes, if you will -that Google uses.""",Google is changing the way its core search engine works to help stop the spread of fake news and hate speech.
"Ian Rule, of Prime Close, Barrington, Cambridgeshire was travelling at 79.8mph (128km/h) when he hit Jason Pallett, Cambridge Crown Court heard. Mr Pallett had run out of money for a taxi and was walking along the A10 near Royston on 23 December 2018. Rule, 53, was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for a year. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of community service and disqualified from driving for 12 months. 'All but invisible' The court heard Mr Pallett had been out with friends celebrating on Saturday, 22 December, 2018. They visited a number of bars in Cambridge until he left at about 04:00 GMT. Prosecutor Charles Falk said Mr Pallett caught a taxi part-way to his home in Reed near Royston, but completed the journey on foot having run out of money. He was wearing dark clothing while walking along the southbound A10, a rural road with no street lighting, and ""would have looked all but invisible"", Mr Falk said. The court heard how at 05:30 a woman driving a car had to ""swerve to avoid him walking in the middle of the road"". Shortly afterwards Rule's Peugeot van hit him. 'Struck from behind' Rule was on his way to work as a delivery driver transporting blood and other items between hospitals. Mr Pallett, who had been ""in the middle of the road"" and one-and-a-half times over the drink drive limit was ""struck from behind"" and died at the scene, Mr Falk said. ""But for the excessive speed, the collision could have been avoided,"" he added. The court heard Rule had been left ""a broken man"" following the crash and that he felt ""considerable sorrow"". The court also heard victim statements from Mr Pallett's family, including his brother John, father Kevin and mother Anne. The Millwall fan was described as a happy, kind, ""good man"" who had been looking forward to having his own family.

"Manchester City Council has since paid the 18-year-old, known as Marcus, £1,600 for the ""avoidable distress"". Marcus, who entered local authority care in 2013, said his life had been ""put on hold"" because of the council's error, missing out on three vacancies. His case is one of several highlighted by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman in a critical report. The watchdog showed several instances in which children had been ""let down"" by local authorities. 'Most vulnerable' Careless: Helping to improve council services to children in care looked at the journey of children coming into care and whether they were offered stability in the system. The report also examined whether appropriate contact arrangements had been made with family members, and how the young people were treated when leaving care. Marcus said he had lost the job opportunities because he did not have the identity documents he required. He also said he feared for his residency status in the UK. The watchdog upheld Marcus's 2018 complaint against Manchester City Council, noting that he was ""reliant on the council to safeguard his welfare"". The ombudsman said the council had seven years to provide him with identity documents and a passport. To date, the issue remains unresolved. A Manchester City Council spokesman said: ""We very much regret any distress our past actions caused to Marcus and fully accept the ombudsman's finding. ""We're in close contact with him and are actively supporting him in his chosen career path to help ensure he has a successful future."" In other council areas the report said a teenager was given a tent to live in while a child was denied the chance to say goodbye to his dying mother. Local government and social care ombudsman Michael King said each case ""reflected the real-life experiences of some of the most vulnerable in our society"". The system was under ""even more pressure"" following the coronavirus pandemic, he said. The ombudsman said 28% more children were in care in 2019 than a decade earlier.","A teenage care leaver was unable to get a job after his council failed to apply for a passport for him, a report said."
"By Gemma HandyPortland, Jamaica Here in rural Portland, Jamaica's wettest parish for as long as anyone can remember, farmers like Mrs Reid are battling for survival on the frontier of climate change. ""I couldn't understand why it was so dry. We used to have lovely seasons; now everything has changed,"" she says. Una May Gordon is the principal director of the climate change division at Jamaica's ministry of economic growth. She says that Portland is experiencing a ""significant drought"". ""Farmers didn't know how to manage those issues as they've always had rain. There was a lot of confusion,"" she says. Evolving weather patterns are making their impact felt across the Caribbean, according to Glenroy Brown, a climate service specialist at Jamaica's Meteorological Service. He says that during the drought which hit Jamaica in 2014-2015, losses in agriculture production were as high as 72%. In a nation where one in six working people earns a living from agriculture, those losses are far-reaching and sorely felt. ""We can't be reactive to climate change anymore,"" Mr Brown urges. ""Agriculture is a significant percentage of GDP so if anything happens to affect it, it's very bad for the country."" Smart tools Now, experts behind a trailblazing venture with innovative technology at its core hope to give islanders the tools to fight back. A climate-smart project is being implemented and funded by the Netherlands-based Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) in three parishes in the east of Jamaica, which is most susceptible to extreme weather. ""We are seeing more drought and more extreme weather, that's why we need to make things happen to cope with this,"" explains programme co-ordinator Bertil Videt. Working closely with government agencies, the aim is to boost productivity and food security, while improving planters' resilience and income. Data is gleaned from weather satellites, combined with local met offices' predictions and delivered to farmers via sophisticated weather apps. The free apps, downloaded on to smartphones, are capable of forecasting three months ahead. This is key for farmers who have not only been hit by droughts but also by erratic downpours, tropical storms and hurricanes. Oluyede Ajayi, also from the CTA, says that they had to take this into account when developing their programme for Jamaica. ""The rain either comes in torrents or not at all. Very wide extremes have become the new normal,"" he says. Farmers can also sign up for planting tips via text message and early warning alerts for hazards like flash floods and fires. The work has seen 5,000 farmers across Portland, St Mary and St Thomas digitally profiled for the first time. Storing their personal details, plus information about their farms and produce, onto a national database means they can receive location-specific advice. Coupled with savvy land management training and the development of drought-resistant seeds by the Jamaican government, farmers are expected to see up to a 40% increase in output within two to three years. You may also be interested in: Mr Ajayi, who heads similar work in Mali and Ethiopia, says the weather apps boast an impressive 88% reliability. Mrs Reid may have lost hope for her beloved bananas but expects to reap thousands of pounds of hardier pineapples this year instead. ""I started with just 17 plants,"" she says proudly, surveying the abundance of fruit thriving again at her Belle Castle orchard. Mulching to retain moisture is just one of the techniques she was taught by attending local farmer forums. The regular gatherings are also used to share information from the apps to growers with limited internet connectivity. 'The river took it' In neighbouring St Mary, parts of the Pagee River, used for irrigation by farmers for decades, have been bone dry since March. Vultures soar above a former coconut plantation destroyed by one of hundreds of fires that have plagued the parish this summer. Howard White lost his previous farm to intense floods. ""The river came and took it by night,"" he recalls with a shudder. ""My two feet trembled when I saw that but I knew I had to stay strong and replant."" It is not just erratic rainfall giving him headaches but crucifying heat too, he continues, wiping his brow. June was the hottest month ever recorded in Jamaica with temperatures topping 39C. Still, thanks to the weather apps which tell him precisely how much rain he can expect for the next five days, along with wind direction and speed, temperature and humidity, his new farm higher up the hillside is thriving. Mr White now plans to extend beyond plantain and cocoa plants and plant scotch bonnet peppers too. He has also been taught to create contours in the sloped land, fringed with log barriers to prevent soil erosion. 'Leaps and bounds ahead' CTA's involvement has taken government efforts to help farmers to a new dimension, says Dwayne Henry, of Jamaica's Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA). ""We are leaps and bounds ahead of where we were,"" he tells the BBC. ""Some of the older folk take longer to warm up to the apps but they get there and are now relying on us to send out the information."" The user-friendly, interactive design with brief, pithy text helps accommodate all literacy levels, Mr Henry explains. Since the project began in June 2018, it has proved so popular the government now hopes to roll it out nationwide. CTA's Bertil Videt hopes the initiative will reap the rewards seen in Africa. ""We've seen vast differences in the yields of farmers in Mali using the project, compared to those who did not,"" he explains. Success cannot come soon enough for planters like Elaine Reid who says drought has reduced the size of her onions, slashing the income from her half-acre Belle Castle holding by half. Her neighbour Kofi Mendes agrees. ""We see climate change first-hand; we live it each day,"" he says. ""It makes me angry, sad, confused. Knowing how to adapt to it is crucial."" You may want to watch:","When the rains stopped coming two years ago, transforming Denise Reid's once flourishing banana fields into an expanse of desiccated wasteland, she was bewildered at first."
"They and those considered at extremely high risk have been urged to call their local health board to book a vaccine appointment. But each of Wales' seven health boards have issued different advice to those who are yet to have their first jab. The Welsh Government said ""each health board has local arrangements"". By last Saturday in Wales, a total of 655,419 people - the highest of the UK nations - had received their first jab, but it means about 85,000 people in the first four priority groups still await a first dose. The Welsh Government said that by mid-February it aimed to vaccinate everyone in those groups. Older People's Commissioner for Wales Helena Herklots, said: ""The progress made in rolling out the coronavirus vaccine and the increasing speed we have seen during the past couple of weeks are to be welcomed, and I would like to thank vaccination teams and volunteers throughout Wales for all of their hard work. ""For those individuals who haven't yet received their vaccine and are in the top four priority groups, it is vital that the change in process is as clear as possible. ""I have therefore discussed this change of process with the Welsh Government to reiterate that it needs to be as straightforward as possible and that clear, accessible messaging is key."" Previously, people had been urged not to call their GPs or health board for an appointment, as notification would be sent by letter. But some health boards in Wales subsequently put out messages urging those in the top priority groups - over 70s, those classed as ""extremely clinically vulnerable"", and any NHS or social care workers - who had not been contacted, to get in touch. Victoria Lloyd, chief executive of Age Cymru, said while there were some differences in roll-outs in each health board, the way the change in information was communicated had been worrying. ""We would have some concerns if health boards relied solely upon digital media to communicate with older people, as approximately half of the over 75s in Wales are not online,"" she said. ""Fundamentally, the most important thing is that the right people get the right information, on time and in an accessible format."" BBC Wales asked all health board in Wales what their latest advice was for people in these priority groups who have not yet been contacted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Each health board has local arrangements in place to enable people get in touch if they are still waiting to hear about their vaccination appointment.""

"By Michael RaceBBC News Protesters say it is a symbol of racism and imperialism and Oriel College undergraduates believe it gives Rhodes ""inappropriate honour and prestige"". It comes after anti-racism demonstrators in Bristol tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. The college's governing body will discuss the statue's fate later. It sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. Kate Whittington, president of Oriel College's junior common room, said the statue ""looms over the college as a symbol of Oriel's continuing refusal to listen to the voices of its undergraduates and, most importantly, of its black students"". Students want the college to put the statue in a museum and explain ""their past decisions to keep the statue in place"". The college decided to keep the statue following protests in 2016 and denied claims it kept it because of donors threatening to withdraw funding. Black Lives Matter campaigners marched through Oxford on Tuesday night and thousands protested on 9 June. Rhodes Must Fall campaigners have said Oxford University has ""failed to address its institutional racism"" and urged it to improve its representation of black students and ""decolonise"" its curriculum. Oxford University's vice chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, has previously said she believed ""hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment"". Who was Cecil Rhodes?",Students at an Oxford University college have joined calls to remove a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes.
"George Ferguson was voted in as mayor in 2012 and made the construction of an arena key to his plans for the city. He lost his position to Labour's Marvin Rees in 2016 and the plan for a central arena has been reviewed, with an alternative in Filton considered. Mr Rees is looking for ""clarity"" on the plans with a decision yet to be made. Mr Ferguson told the Bristol Post the arena should be the ""beating heart"" of the city and has criticised the alternative plans. Two locations are being considered, one by Temple Meads and the other at an airport hangar in Filton, about five miles away. The Filton plans would be funded by its Malaysian owners YTL Developments. Mr Ferguson has accused Mr Rees of falling ""hook, line and sinker"" for the ""barmy"" hangar proposals during a trip to Malaysia in December in which he was hosted by YTL. A council spokesman confirmed Mr Rees had ""received hospitality"" from the company ""to attend discussions about infrastructure and investment opportunities in Bristol"". This has been properly declared by Mr Rees in his published register of interests and ""was at nil-cost to the public purse"", the spokesman added. The project, first mooted in 2003, has been beset by delays and rising costs. A final decision on the location is due to be announced at a cabinet meeting on 4 September.","Building a long-awaited arena on the outskirts of Bristol rather than in the city centre would be ""a crazy thing to do"", a former mayor has said."
"Access to such data is considered vital for hitting missiles, drones and other targets with precision. The deal was announced after the annual ""2+2"" high-level talks in Delhi on Tuesday. Experts say the strengthening of India-US ties is aimed at countering China's influence in the region. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper held talks with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also met Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar. ""Over [the] last two decades, our bilateral relationship has grown steadily in its substance, facets and significance,"" Mr Jaishankar said on Tuesday. He added that the talks would enable the two countries to ""engage much more intensively on matters of national security"". The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation, or BECA, is among the few deals that the US signs with close partners. It allows India access to a range of sensitive geospatial and aeronautical data that is crucial for military action. The two sides also signed a clutch of other deals in the fields of nuclear energy, earth sciences and alternative medicine. But BECA is the most significant deal among them. It will allow the US to ""provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India"", an Indian defence source told Reuters news agency - that also means the US can fit high-end navigational equipment in the aircraft it supplies to India. Its signing comes at a time when India is locked in one of its most hostile standoffs with China along their disputed border in the Himalayan region. Twenty Indian soldiers died in a clash that erupted between troops on both sides in June, sparking months-long rounds of diplomatic talks to ease tensions. But that has not helped to de-escalate hostilities so far. Relations between the US and China have also soured in recent months with President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The US has also rebuked China for imposing a new security law in Hong Kong, following large-scale protests. The deal is another step forward in deepening India-US military ties. India is one of the word's biggest defence equipment buyers, but around 60-70% of its inventory is supplied by Russia. Covid-era diplomacy Rajini Vaidyanathan , BBC News, Delhi In sign of the times, hand sanitiser stations were placed in front of the press cordon, and everyone, including the politicians, were wearing a mask. That two of America's most senior Cabinet ministers chose to travel in person to meet their counterparts during times of Covid, and a week before the US presidential vote, is an indication of just how important these talks were. Countering the influence of China in the region is the overarching theme of this trip - US officials will also travel to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia in the coming days - nations which enjoy strong ties with Beijing. The US wants to change this and has become one of the fastest-growing defence suppliers for India in recent years. Echoes of such plans can be heard in the statements of both countries' leaders. This visit will reinforce US and India's ""commitment to deepening military-to-military co-operation,"" an official statement said after Mr Esper met Mr Singh on Monday. ""Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at further deepening defence co-operation in a wide range of areas,"" Mr Singh later tweeted. This is the third round of the ""two-plus-two"" annual dialogue between India and the US. The first one was held in Delhi in 2018. The latest one, originally scheduled for earlier this year, was delayed due to the pandemic and comes just a week shy of US election results. Analysts say that the timing is significant and highlights India as a priority for the US. A tight diplomatic rope Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi The deal is key, given the current geopolitical scenario. The US seems to have sensed an opportunity in the India-China border standoff and wants to further raise its profile in the region. It's being seen as a signal to China that Washington considers Delhi a close military ally. And this is likely to bolster the Trump administration's anti-China rhetoric. But Indian officials will have to walk a tight diplomatic rope. Delhi continues to hold military-level talks with Beijing to de-escalate the situation at the border and a peaceful resolution is in its best interest. It will not want a conflict, even a limited one, at a time when it's fighting a long-haul battle against the pandemic. This was evident from the statements made by the leaders of the two countries at a joint press conference on Tuesday. While Mr Singh and Mr Jaishankar did not directly mention China in their statements, both Mr Esper and Mr Pompeo took swipes at China. India will also be mindful of its relations with Russia. So it will be interesting to see how it balances its military and strategic ties with both Washington and Moscow.",India and the US have signed a military agreement on sharing sensitive satellite data amid Delhi's tense border standoff with Beijing.
"By Dave WadeBBC News Don Hale could hardly have foreseen that by championing the case he would go on to suffer police intimidation and receive death threats - there were even two apparent attempts on his life - forcing him to leave his Derbyshire home. But the Downing case would eventually change the law, win Hale an OBE and make him a go-to journalist to investigate major miscarriages of justice. In the years since the release of Mr Downing, Hale has also helped to free Barry George, the man who spent eight years in jail for the murder of Jill Dando, and to clear the name of footballer, Ched Evans, after a controversial rape retrial. For Hale, the brutal trigger for his life of campaigning was the 1973 killing of 32-year-old Wendy Sewell. She was found badly beaten but still alive in a Bakewell graveyard by Mr Downing, a council gardener. He was arrested and questioned without a solicitor for several hours but, aged 17 and with a reading age of 11, officers pressured him into signing a confession to the attack, filled with words he did not understand. When Mrs Sewell died two days later, the charge was upgraded to murder. Mr Downing immediately retracted his confession but was found guilty at a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. After their son had spent two decades in prison, Mr Downing's parents approached Hale, editor of the Matlock Mercury, for help. He faced obstacles at every turn, with police telling him all the evidence had been ""burnt, lost and destroyed"". A turning point came when Derby Museum staff informed him that the murder weapon - a pickaxe handle - was on display there. With Hale's help, Mr Downing won £13,000 from the Legal Aid Board. This paid for a modern forensic examination of the weapon, crucially revealing Mr Downing's fingerprints were not present - although there was a bloody palm print from an unknown person. The clothes Mr Downing had been wearing, which had been returned to his parents, were flecked with spots of blood which Hale believed were consistent with him having tried to help Wendy Sewell as she lay dying. ""I reported developments through the Matlock Mercury - it became like The Archers, a bit of a saga,"" he joked. But the articles prompted real-life drama in the form of anonymous death threats and what Hale claims was police harassment. ""They made my life absolute hell for five or six years,"" he said. ""I was pulled up for speeding, stopped and searched, victimised."" Letters were sent to his home and a brick was thrown through the newspaper's window. Most seriously, on two occasions a vehicle was driven at him at speed, which he believes were attempts to kill him. Police even gave him a mirror on a stick to check for bombs under his car. ""I was very worried for my family. There weren't threats against other journalists, it was simply against me. It turned into a rollercoaster,"" he said. But all of this merely strengthened his resolve: ""If Downing had done it, why should anyone want to threaten me?"" Mr Downing was ineligible for parole under the law at the time because he had refused to admit his guilt. Hale believed this was unfair and took the matter to the European Court of Human Rights, winning the case in 1996. It was adopted into law that prisoners who maintained their innocence after conviction could apply for parole. By now, the Downing case was attracting attention from far and wide: ""I became a hero in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, because I had taken on the British government and won,"" Hale said. Closer to home, Hale said then Prime Minister Tony Blair asked him for help in setting up an independent body to investigate miscarriages of justice, which became the Criminal Case Review Commission (CCRC). Stephen Downing's was one of the first cases to be looked at by the CCRC. It recommended his conviction should be overturned on the basis that the circumstances in which he gave his confession made it unreliable evidence that should not have gone before a jury. The conviction was quashed in 2001 with Mr Downing finally walking free in January 2002. Hale was pleased but also disappointed: ""He had got off on a technicality,"" he said. ""He didn't get his day in court because police were bang to rights. Somebody should have been called to account."" The legal challenge to Mr Downing's conviction focused on the way detectives had conducted the original investigation in 1973. He had been questioned without a lawyer and there were serious doubts about whether he had been properly advised of his legal rights. These facts were never made known to the jury that convicted him, but they were enough to overturn the conviction. But Mr Downing, for his part, was not angry: ""Who would I feel bitter against? The system? I think I would be punishing myself,"" he said. With much more to say himself, Hale wrote the book, Town Without Pity, which was turned into BBC drama, In Denial of Murder, in 2004. Police reopened their investigation, interviewing 1,600 witnesses, at an estimated cost of £500,000, but failed to identify any alternative suspect - although Hale has previously said he believes he has a ""very good idea"" who killed Wendy Sewell. Mr Downing was later awarded £900,000 in compensation. The huge press attention the case attracted finally forced Hale to relocate to north Wales. ""One of the reasons I moved away from Derbyshire was to get relief,"" he said. ""It wasn't fair on my family."" But he was soon called on to help with another miscarriage of justice. BBC Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando was shot dead on her fiancé's west London doorstep in April 1999. A year later, after interviewing over hundreds of people, the Met Police charged 41-year-old Barry George, a self-confessed stalker and loner, with her murder. He was tried, convicted and jailed for life. But there were serious concerns about the police investigation, and in 2004 Hale was asked to get involved. ""Quite quickly, I found a lot of evidence that didn't match up,"" he said. He went to see Mr George in prison where he was ""like a lion in a cage"", pacing the floor. ""How could he do a clinical murder like that?"" Hale said. ""Everyone that was dealing with him said he's a bit of an oddball but he's not a killer."" Gunpowder residue on Mr George's clothing had played a large part in convicting him. But Hale said there was so little of it that it could have come from weapons armed police were carrying when he was arrested. The CCRC referred Mr George's case to the Court of Appeal and a retrial took place at the Old Bailey in 2008, when he was cleared of murder and released. Ched Evans was serving a five-year sentence for rape when his family approached Hale for help. ""I didn't want to touch it because it was so high profile,"" he said. But Mr Evans' mother had serious doubts about the ""rushed"" investigation. The then-Sheffield United striker had been convicted of raping a 19-year-old woman at a Premier Inn in Denbighshire in May 2011. At the same trial, footballer Clayton McDonald was acquitted of the offence. Hale believed the guilty verdict was an ""emotional response"" from the jury, owing to Mr Evans' ""cockiness"". ""He thought he was God's gift to women,"" Hale said. He spent six months working on the case, in which time Mr Evans was released having served half of his sentence. ""My knowledge and experience meant I could cut corners and had an important point that I knew the IPCC would look at."" That point was the woman's sexual history and, after the CCRC agreed there was enough evidence to quash the conviction, this evidence controversially formed part of the retrial. Unlike during the original trial, her previous sexual partners gave evidence recounting similar encounters to the one in the hotel room that night. It led to plans to review the law protecting alleged rape victims from disclosing details of their sex lives. Mr Evans was cleared in October 2016 but it left a bitter taste for Hale. ""In this case it was right - you have got to look at each case on its own merit,"" he said. ""But the whole thing was a bit unsavoury and not good for the girl herself."" Hale said at the time he hoped the case did not deter women from coming forward to report sexual offences. But, had that evidence been used in the original trial, ""Evans would have been cleared,"" he said. The case took its toll on Hales, now 64, and he has decided not to investigate any more miscarriages of justice, focusing instead on writing books. ""I am proud of what I have done,"" he said. ""If it wasn't for people like me you'd have no-one to say, 'this isn't the way we should interview people, this is not the way we should treat people'."" Yet he still insists modestly that much of the credit for overturning the miscarriages of justice he has worked on belongs to others, seeing himself more as a catalyst for change. ""You have got to have somebody who gets the ball rolling.""","Fifteen years ago Stephen Downing was acquitted after spending 27 years in prison for murder, overturning one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice and putting into the spotlight the local newspaper editor who helped to bring the police's case tumbling down."
"It's not too rare for the two sides to face off, but almost unheard of to play in the North's capital, Pyongyang. In fact, it's only happened once, in 1990. There was no live broadcast, no fans from the South, and no foreign media at all in the stands as the sides played out a goalless draw. After some progress in 2018 - when sports partly broke the ice - ties between North and South are at a low. Safe to say, this was a match the home side were not taking lightly. ""Football is the most popular spectator sport in North Korea and sports are hugely important for the North,"" Andray Abrahamian, senior adjunct fellow at the Pacific Forum, told the BBC before the match. ""It provides a focal point for pride and patriotism. In a sense, it's pretty similar to how other countries use sports for social purposes."" If you wanted to follow the match between the two national men's teams you'd have had a hard time. Apart from the fact it wasn't broadcast live, even international tourists currently in North Korea weren't allowed to watch the game. How unusual is a North Korea - South Korea match? It does happen: both countries are members of Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation, meaning they can be drawn against each other in international competition. There have also been friendly matches - including that game in Pyongyang in 1990. This time, it was a qualifier for the 2022 Qatar World Cup that brought them together. But what's rare is that Tuesday's match took place in North Korea. Previously, most games were held either in the South, or in a third country. When they were drawn against each other in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, both the North's home games against the South were played in Shanghai, China. The two countries are technically still at war - the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, but a peace treaty was never signed - and the North would not allow the South's anthem or flag in its stadium. The women's teams have also only played once in the North, for a 2017 qualifier for the Asian Cup the following year. All other women's matches were held either in the South or a third country. Which side were the favourites this time? For the men's sides, the odds were clearly with the South. The team has won or drawn almost every fixture since the first match in the Asian Games in 1978, with the 1990 friendly in Pyongyang being the only time the North triumphed, winning 2-1. Given the South is ranked 37 in the world compared with the North at 113, you might have expected South Korea to win this one as well. Yet both teams remain level at the top of their qualifying group, having each won their previous two games. The South are just ahead on account of having scored more goals so far. Each side has a star player: for the South, Tottenham's Son Heung-min, while North Korea have recent Juventus signing Han Kwang-song. Despite North Korea's home advantage, it wasn't even clear before the match whether there would be any home spectators. Talking to reporters on the way to Pyongyang, South Korean players appeared to expect an empty stadium. ""It's much better to play in a packed stadium rather than an empty one, but I think we'll be able to play a good match if we use it as motivation,"" defender Kim Min-jae told AFP news agency. For the women's team, the stats are almost an exact inversion of the men's. The South has won only once. All other matches were either a draw or won by the North. What's the state of North-South relations? The match comes as relations between Seoul and Pyongyang hit another low. The North is upset that South Korea continues to carry out low-level military exercises with the US, and earlier this summer rejected all further talks with Seoul. The North's denuclearisation talks with the US have just again hit a roadblock, and relations with the South tend to ebb and flow alongside such talks. Pyongyang also recently tested a new missile, in a significant advance on earlier tests, increasing tension with Washington. But the ups and downs of North-South relations are not usually reflected in the sporting rivalry. ""The people I've talked to about this in both Koreas generally seem quite supportive of athletes from the other side,"" says Mr Abrahamian. ""They're pleased to see Koreans doing well on the world stage, whatever country they're from."" Sports diplomacy to the rescue? Sport has often been a key to unlocking fresh diplomacy on the peninsula. The 2018 thaw came about when North Korea's Kim Jong-un floated the idea his country could take part in the Winter Olympics in the South. Months later, the two teams marched under a common flag, participated together and even fielded a joint women's ice hockey team. The same feat was repeated at the Asian Games when a unified Korea boating team won a historic gold medal. With the mood in Pyongyang notoriously unpredictable, it is hard to say whether Tuesday's soccer game might again pave the way for fresh diplomacy. In September, North and South agreed they would seek to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. But in the lead-up to the World Cup qualifier, relations remained tense. The South hoped to be able to send fans to the match – but were denied. And Seoul offered to organise the broadcasting of the match, an offer also turned down. ""This time, it doesn't look as if Pyongyang is looking for the match to be a tool to bridge the strained political relationship,"" Mr Abrahamian said. ""Pyongyang has been giving Seoul the cold shoulder for most of this year and that probably won't change - unless the US and North Korea find a breakthrough.""","On Tuesday, North and South Korea played a football derby like no other."

"The march was led by traders from Clifton Village who are concerned most spaces will have a one-hour limit. Spokesman Tony Miles said in a hour you could ""just about get a coffee"" but it was too short for a hairdressing or dental appointment, or to eat out. The council said a consultation had shown residents wanted the scheme. Mr Miles, who represents the area's traders and organised the march, urged mayor George Ferguson to come and see how the area worked daily. ""The council says if you have a one-hour limit it turns the numbers over but customers have told us they won't come,"" he said. Mr Ferguson said he was ""committed to a review"" of the Clifton scheme which is still being consulted on. The march comes the same day as Mr Ferguson intervened in a row over the number of parking permits allocated to the nearby Hotwells Primary School. It is the latest school in the city to express its concerns about how it might continue to attract good quality staff after resident parking zones are introduced in the Cliftonwood and Hotwells areas from 1 May. Head teacher Annie Butler said many of its staff travelled in ""sustainable"" ways but sometimes they had no alternative but to travel by car. Mr Ferguson said there was a possibility some concessions could be made. He wants to implement a blanket rollout of parking zones within 18 months to halt commuter parking in city streets with residents paying between £48 and £96 for permits.",Several hundred people marched through Bristol protesting ahead of the introduction of a new residents' parking zone.

"Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Today MPs of all parties lined up to condemn the pay off to the former Director General of the BBC, George Entwistle. Self-proclaimed friends of Auntie said the £450,000 payment was making their life harder. Long time critics said it proved that the Corporation is badly run and that its chairman Lord Patten should now face the chop. What was most interesting today though was what didn't happen. Neither the prime minister nor the leader of the opposition said anything about it. David Cameron chaired a Cabinet meeting in Bristol and faced questions at one of his Cameron Direct meetings. He chose to say nothing about the BBC or the pay-off. Ed Miliband did a series of interviews for the ITV regions. He also said nothing on the subject. Both men have taken a conscious decision not to add to the BBC's troubles. Even the Culture Secretary Maria Miller and her shadow Harriet Harman in the Commons were very careful to proclaim their support for the BBC's independence and for Lord Patten before going on to question the amount paid to Mr Entwistle. Miller insisted that it was for the BBC Trust to justify the pay-out and suggested that the National Audit Office might like to examine whether it was value for money. All this is due to something leading politicians and BBC mandarins understand but is a mystery to most licence fee payers. Neither government nor Parliament runs the BBC even though MPs do vote every few years to preserve the BBC by renewing its Royal Charter and set the level of the licence fee whilst the government appoints the Chairman of the BBC Trust which does regulate it. The BBC's reputation rests in part on being able to say that politicians have no influence on editorial decisions or appointments. Lord Patten has justified the pay-off of a year's salary by saying that that's what Entwistle would have got if he was sacked instead of resigning which entitled him to only half that amount. In other words, he believed it was price worth paying to ensure a swift dignified resignation rather than a messy sacking after protracted legal negotiations. In theory the government could sack the chairman of the BBC Trust by what's called an Order in Council which are issued ""by and with the advice of Her Majesty's Privy Council"". There is not the slightest chance of this happening. The only other way Lord Patten will go is if he decides to resign after pressure from fellow trustees or the public or if he becomes bankrupt, mentally incapable or fails to turn up to meetings for three months without permission.","""Hard to justify…not right… a matter for his conscience""."
"The announcement comes a week after the first easing of restrictions in England - and while numbers are typically lower on Sundays, the figure is almost 100 fewer than the 268 reported a week ago. But the overall death toll remains the highest in Europe, and is now 34,636. Meanwhile in Spain, the daily number of deaths dropped below 100 for the first time since its lockdown started. The UK death numbers announced on Sundays and Mondays are typically lower than the other five days of the week, due to fluctuations in how quickly deaths are reported by hospitals and care homes. Sunday's figure is the lowest since 24 March, when 149 deaths were reported. The evening before that, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had introduced the lockdown. Spain, which introduced a strict lockdown on 14 March, announced 87 new deaths on Sunday. At its peak on 2 April, there were 961 deaths in a 24-hour period. Italy has also reported its lowest figure since its lockdown began, with a total of 145. Liker other government ministers during the week, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the country was moving towards level three of the coronavirus alert system, which would see the gradual relaxation of restrictions, but ""to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe workable vaccine"". Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street briefing, he said the clinical trial for a Covid-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford was progressing well and announced £93m to speed up a new vaccine research lab. The government has already invested £47m in the Oxford vaccine and Mr Sharma committed to a further £84m of new funding. He added that pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford and the government. It means if the trial is successful, 30 million doses will be available for the UK by this September, as part of a 100 million-dose agreement. Mr Sharma said this would put the UK at the front of the queue for getting the vaccine. Business Secretary Alok Sharma says research to find a vaccine for coronavirus is progressing at unprecedented speed and with the UK leading it, British people should be at the front of the queue for getting the jab. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has signed a licensing agreement to make 30 million doses available by this September. But that's incredibly ambitious and is conditional on immunisation actually working. Experts admit an effective coronavirus vaccine may never be found. Trials are under way with volunteers being vaccinated. It will take months to be sure of success. That's why researchers are also backing another horse - finding existing drugs and therapies that can be used to improve the survival odds of patients who become extremely ill with coronavirus. The business secretary also said the opening of the UK's first vaccine manufacturing innovation centre is expected to take place in the summer of 2021, a year ahead of schedule, after the government's funding pledge. ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months,"" he said. ""But if, and it is a big if, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture it at scale and quickly. So whilst assent is being built, the government will establish a rapid deployment facility thanks to a further investment of £38m."" In other developments:",The UK's daily figure for coronavirus deaths has dropped to 170 - the lowest since the day after lockdown began.
"Ceredigion leader Ellen ap Gwynn said a mid-Wales growth deal could mean more than 4,000 new jobs and a £200m boost. Mid Wales has relied heavily on public sector jobs that have been lost as public services have been cut. Growth deals involve the UK and Welsh governments, councils and private firms using cash to boost a region's economy Ms ap Gwynn said the project was a chance to support businesses at a time of Brexit uncertainty. She and Powys council leader Rosemarie Harris outlined the 15-year plans to assembly members on Thursday. Growth deals for the Cardiff and Swansea regions have been agreed, although UK and Welsh ministers announced an independent review of the Swansea deal last month. A plan in north Wales is still being finalised. Ms ap Gwynn told BBC Wales the proposal for mid Wales had to be truly ""transformative"". ""The way things are sounding with Brexit, who knows what will happen between now and the end of March. ""We have got to try and take every opportunity we can to support businesses and the development of businesses in mid Wales. Otherwise there is not much future apart from as a playground."" She said mid Wales had relied too much on the public sector in the past ""because of the weakness of the economy"". She added that the deal ""gives us a pot of money with which we can invest in the future. And hopefully invest to the benefit of the private sector"". The UK government said it would welcome proposals for a mid Wales growth deal at the Budget in November 2017, to complete the picture of growth deals covering all parts of Wales. Giving evidence to the assembly's economy committee on Thursday, Powys council's deputy chief executive David Powell suggested such a deal was needed to save the very social fabric of mid Wales. ""I just reflect on the importance of doing this for the sustainability not only of mid Wales but for public services in mid Wales, because we're seeing depopulation in mid Wales. ""Now unless this is reversed this really does call into question the sustainability of the current structures that we've got across mid Wales."" 'Tremendous potential' Environment Systems, based at the Aberystwyth Science Park, is backing a mid Wales growth deal. The firm's Dr Jamie Williams thinks the area needs to invest in transport links because ""Aberystwyth is reasonably isolated as far as connections go"". ""Some of the connections, the transport links, could be improved. The railway network and fast links."" Aberystwyth University's Dr Rhodri Llwyd Morgan sees ""tremendous potential"" in a growth deal for a region with a ""certain number of challenges and opportunities"". ""We think that with the sort of experience we can bring to the table, the research and innovation excellence we have, as well as working more closely with businesses across a range of sectors, we can make use and take advantage of the opportunities we have,"" he said.","Mid Wales has little future other than as a ""playground"" for tourists unless plans to boost its economy succeed, a council leader has warned."

"The adult squacco heron was first spotted by birdwatchers on 6 May at Blagdon Lake and further sightings have also been reported at Chew Valley Lake. Ornithologist Ed Drewitt described the spotting as ""significant"". ""There's a good population in France and Spain and as they expand their population they pop over and visit,"" Mr Drewitt said. ""The Chew Valley and Blagdon Lake area - and further south on the Somerset Levels - provide a great habitat with reed beds and grass fields for them to feed. ""Over the next decade we can expect to see more species to come over."" Birdwatchers believe the bird is an adult which has not yet reached full breeding condition. It is thought the heron is still in the area but getting harder to spot as vegetation is growing taller and the water line recedes out of the meadows. Patric Bulmer, environment manager with Bristol Water, said the arrival had caused a lot of interest in the birding community. He said the company had been creating habitats which are good for both local species as well as those blown off course. ""Visitors to Blagdon and Chew often get to see rare or exotic species - the last visitor which caused much interest was a sharp tail sandpiper which was spotted at Chew,"" he added.",A bird rarely seen in Britain has been spotted at two reservoirs in North Somerset.

"By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy Gutenberg figured out how to make large quantities of durable metal type and how to fix that type firmly enough to print hundreds of copies of a page, yet flexibly enough that the type could be reused to print an entirely different page. His famous bibles were objects beautiful enough to rival the calligraphy of the monks. The crisp black Latin script is perfectly composed into two dense blocks of text, occasionally highlighted with a flourish of red ink. Actually, you can quibble with Gutenberg's place in history. The movable type press was originally developed in China. Even as Gutenberg was inventing in Germany, Koreans were ditching their entire method of writing to make printing easier, cutting tens of thousands of characters down to only 28. It is also not true that Gutenberg single-handedly created mass literacy. It was common 600 or 700 years earlier in the Abbasid Caliphate, spanning the Middle East and North Africa. Still, the Gutenberg press did change the world. It led to Europe's reformation, science, the newspaper, the novel, the school textbook, and much else. But it could not have done so without another invention, just as essential but much more often overlooked: paper. Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Paper was another Chinese idea, from 2,000 years ago. Initially it was used for wrapping precious objects, but soon people began to write on it because it was lighter than bamboo and cheaper than silk. Soon the Arabic world embraced it, but Christians in Europe did not. Paper came to Germany only a few decades before Gutenberg's press. Why? For centuries, Europeans did not need the stuff. They had parchment, made from animal skin. It was pricey - a parchment bible required the skins of 250 sheep - but since so few people could read or write, that hardly mattered. But as a commercial class arose, needing contracts and accounts, cheaper writing material looked more attractive. The quintessential industrial product And cheap paper made the economics of printing more attractive too: the cost of typesetting could easily be offset by a long print run, with no need to slaughter a million sheep. Printing is only the start of paper's uses. We decorate our walls with wallpaper, posters and photographs, we filter tea and coffee through it, package milk and juice in it and as corrugated cardboard, we use it to make boxes. We use wrapping paper, greaseproof paper, sandpaper, paper napkins, paper receipts and paper tickets. In the 1870s - the same decade that produced the telephone and the light bulb - the British Perforated Paper Company produced a kind of paper that was soft, strong, and absorbent. It was the world's first dedicated toilet paper. In fact, paper is the quintessential industrial product, churned out at incredible scale and when Christian Europeans finally embraced paper, they created arguably the continent's first heavy industry. Endless innovation Initially, paper was made from pulped cotton. Some kind of chemical was required to break down the raw material. The ammonia from urine works well, so for centuries the paper mills of Europe were powered by human waste. Pulping also needs a tremendous amount of mechanical energy. One of the early sites of paper manufacture, Fabriano in Italy, used fast-flowing mountain streams to power massive drop-hammers. Once finely macerated, the cellulose from the cotton breaks free and floats around in a kind of thick soup. Thinned and allowed to dry, the cellulose reforms as a strong, flexible mat. Over time, the process saw endless innovation: threshing machines, bleaches and additives helped to make paper more quickly and cheaply, even if the result was often a more fragile product. By 1702, paper was so cheap, it was used to make a product explicitly designed to be thrown away after only 24 hours: the Daily Courant, the world's first daily newspaper. And then, an almost inevitable industrial crisis: Europe and America became so hungry for paper that they began to run out of rags. The situation became so desperate that scavengers combed battlefields after wars, stripping the dead of their bloodstained uniforms to sell to paper mills. An alternative source of cellulose was found - wood. The Chinese had long since known how to do it, but Europeans were slow to catch up. More from Tim Harford Why the falling cost of light matters The compiler: Computing's hidden hero How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream In 1719, a French biologist, Rene Antoine Ferchault De Reaumur, wrote a scientific paper pointing out that wasps could make paper nests by chewing wood, so why couldn't humans? When his idea was rediscovered years later, paper makers found that wood is not an easy raw material and contains much less cellulose than cotton rags. It was the mid-19th century before wood became a significant source for paper production in the West. Today, paper is increasingly made out of paper itself, often recycled - appropriately enough - in China. A cardboard box emerges from the paper mills of Ningbo, 130 miles (200km) south of Shanghai, and is used to package a laptop. The box is shipped across the Pacific, the laptop is extracted and the box is thrown into a recycling bin in Seattle or Vancouver. Then it's shipped back to Ningbo, to be pulped and turned into another box. When it comes to writing, though, some say paper's days are numbered, believing the computer will usher in the ""paperless office"". But this has been predicted since Thomas Edison, in the late 19th century, who thought office memos would be recorded on his wax cylinders instead. The idea really caught on as computers started to enter the workplace in the 1970s and it was repeated in breathless futurologists' reports for the next decades. Meanwhile, paper sales stubbornly continued to boom. Yes, computers made it simple to distribute documents without paper, but printers made it equally easy for recipients to put them on paper anyway. America's copiers, fax machines and printers continued to spew out enough sheets of paper to cover the country every five years. After a while, the paperless office became less a prediction, more a punchline. But perhaps things are finally changing: in 2013, the world hit peak paper. Many of us may still prefer the feel of a book or a physical newspaper to swiping a screen, but the cost of digital distribution is now so much lower that we are increasingly choosing the cheaper option. Finally, digital is doing to paper what paper did to parchment with the help of the Gutenberg press: outcompeting it, not on quality, but on price. Paper may be on the decline, but it will survive not only on the supermarket shelf or beside the lavatory, but in the office too. Old technologies have a habit of enduring. We still use pencils and candles and the world still produces more bicycles than cars. Paper was never only a home for beautiful typesetting, it was everyday stuff. And for jottings, lists and doodles, you still can't beat the back of the envelope.

"Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1%. in the three months to March, while inflation rose by 2.3% in the year to March 2017. In the first three months of this year, wages fell by 0.2%. Meanwhile, the number of unemployed people fell by 53,000 to 1.54 million in the three months to March, said the Office for National Statistics. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6%, its lowest in 42 years, The jobless rate has not been lower since the June to August period of 1975. The employment rate, the proportion of 16 to 64 year olds in work, was 74.8%, the highest since records began in 1971. Headache? Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""With inflation forecast to carry on rising - Bank of England policymakers predict inflation will peak at a little below 3% in the fourth quarter - household budgets look certain to be squeezed further in the coming months."" Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, echoed this sentiment: ""Alarm bells will be ringing for Britons with wages continuing to fall. This could cause a headache for the government over the standard of living in post-Brexit Britain in the run up to next month's general election."" Analysis: Jonty Bloom, business correspondent The UK economy is great at creating jobs, but not very good at paying people well. That's because our productivity is falling: in the first three months of this year, it fell sharply by 0.5%, taking us back to the same level as in 2008. Productivity is measured by dividing economic output by the number of hours we all work. It should increase steadily as we get better educated, trained and equipped - in short, more efficient at our jobs. But it is in the doldrums again and that matters. If we don't make more, we can't afford to pay more and we are making no more per hour now than we did nine years ago. Between January and March, the number of 16 to 64 year old women in jobs was 70.2%, also the highest rate since records began. Meanwhile 79.5% of 16 to 64-year-old men were in work, the highest since 1991. The ONS attributed the rise in the rate of women's employment, in part, to changes to the State Pension age for women, which has meant fewer women retiring between 60 and 65. 'Consistently higher' The unemployment rate among 16 to 24 year olds was 12.5%, down from 13.7% in January to March of last year. ""The unemployment rate for those aged from 16 to 24 has been consistently higher than that for older age groups,"" said the ONS. In late 2011 youth unemployment reached a peak of 22.5%, and even at its lowest in 2001 it was running at 11.5%. Between early 1992, when comparable records began, and this year, the proportion of young people in full-time education jumped from 26.2% to 44%. The number of UK nationals working in the UK increased by 179,000 compared with January to March of last year to stand at 28.31 million. The number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 207,000 to a record 3.55 million, meaning 11.1% of all people working in the UK are non-UK nationals.","Wage growth is lagging behind inflation for the first time since mid-2014, official figures show."
"Other options than the Keystone XL pipeline could be worse for climate change, the state department said. However, the 2,000-page report did not go as far as recommending that the project proceed. This $7bn (£4.5bn) pipeline is meant to bring oil from the tar sands of Alberta to the refineries of Texas. It is supported by industry but opposed by environmentalists, who have staged protests outside the White House. State department approval is needed because the pipeline crosses a US border. The latest report said damage to the environment by the 1,700-mile (2,735km) pipeline would probably be limited, if certain safety measures were used. The White House stalled the pipeline project in 2011 amid concerns it would damage the environment along the route. Public comments The report says Canadian tar sands are likely to be developed, regardless of whether the US approves the pipeline. It says Keystone XL is ""unlikely to have a substantial impact"" on oil production in the Canadian province of Alberta. Correspondents say this conclusion could allay fears the plan would increase greenhouse gas emissions. But the environmental review stopped short of recommending whether or not the project should be approved. The proposed pipeline, which would carry 800,000 barrels of oil each day from Alberta to Texas, would have passed through a major aquifer in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. But in May, TransCanada, the Canadian company trying to build the pipeline, proposed a new route. The release of Friday's report will be followed by a 45-day period for public comment. A final decision on the project is expected later this year. Environmental groups and some Democrats have warned against the risk of a spill, while industry groups and many Republicans said the project would create jobs and bring petrol prices down.",A US government report on controversial plans to build an oil pipeline from Canada to Texas says the project raises no major environmental concerns.
"The footage of the child outside Downend School near Bristol on November 30 was shared by parents with the BBC. The school did not respond to a request for comment but a letter from head teacher Lisa Howell has been sent to parents explaining what happened. It says police were called and officers promised an ""appropriate and robust"" approach. The head teacher said the boy carrying the knife ""has no connection with the school and we expect no further issues"". ""A knife was secured by duty staff, the police were called and the knife and the details of the incident have been passed to investigating officers who assure us that appropriate and robust action is being taken,"" the letter said. ""A small number of students were involved or witnesses the incident. We have spoken to all those young people and their parents.""

"A former worker at Dounreay in Caithness has told staff that it was his understanding a turntable from HMS Howe was installed in Lab 33. It allowed a machine with remotely-controlled arms to swivel around in a cell of the lab, which opened in 1960. HMS Howe saw action in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific. It was one of the last battleships to be built on the Clyde and was scrapped in 1958. Lab 33 was used from 1960 to 1993 for analysis of radioactive material from Dounreay's three nuclear reactors. The laboratory, along with the turntable, is about to be cleaned up and pulled down as part of a wider project to decommission Dounreay. Stuart Tod, who operated Lab 33 from 1982 until it closed, has told staff preparing for its demolition that he believed the turntable was from the battleship. A drawing exists of how it was wired up in Lab 33, but nothing has been found of the turntable's construction. Staff from Dounreay Site Restoration Limited believe this provides further evidence that it came from the ship and was not built from scratch. HMS Howe, a King George V class warship , acted as an escort for merchant vessels on the Russian Arctic Convoys. It also played roles in the invasions of Sicily and Okinawa.",Part of a scrapped World War II battleship's gun turret is thought to have been cannibalised for use in a laboratory at a nuclear power plant.
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent The day ended with a stand-off with police in Trafalgar Square. Demonstrations were held in cities across the UK - with occupations taking place in at least eight universities. Meanwhile in Wales, the assembly government has announced its students will pay thousands less in fees than in England. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he might now abstain in the vote on fees. In Birmingham about 30 protesters occupied the city council's offices. There were also protests in Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast, Brighton, Manchester and Bristol, with school pupils joining students. Students are campaigning against plans to raise tuition fees in England to up to £9,000 per year, with a vote expected in the House of Commons before Christmas. The Welsh Assembly Government announced its own fee plans, which will see Welsh students at university in Wales and England paying no more than £3,290 per year. It would mean that an English student at a university in England could pay more than £17,000 more for a three-year degree than a Welsh student on the same course. 'Kettling' Hundreds of protesters marched through central London in freezing conditions, but the numbers were smaller than the two previous demonstrations. Demonstrators tried to avoid being caught in police lines, after thousands were held in a ""kettle"" last week. Police eventually surrounded a group of around 150-200 people in Trafalgar Square, where fires were lit, graffiti daubed on statues and missiles thrown at riot police. A police officer was taken to hospital with head injuries and three protesters were also hurt. A 19-year-old student told the BBC their strategy was to avoid being contained by police: ""Whenever the police block us off, we turn round and go the other way. ""We also do not want to be panicked into violence. Smashing up windows was necessary in the beginning to get the demonstrations on the front pages, but now any violence would be counter-productive."" Anger at Lib Dems A total of 153 people were arrested during the course of protests in London. Some 139 were arrested for breach of the peace, and seven with violent disorder, the Metropolitan Police said. The National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts earlier accused the police of having ""pre-emptively blocked"" the protest route. The Metropolitan Police say the marchers began earlier than planned and there was ""never any intention to contain the protesters"". Protesters have directed anger towards the Liberal Democrats, whose MPs gave personal pledges to students that they would vote against any increase in fees. But it remains uncertain whether Liberal Democrat ministers will abstain or support the proposals to raise tuition fees to £9,000 per year, when it comes to a vote in the House of Commons. Local protests Vince Cable, the secretary of state responsible for universities, has indicated that he might not vote in favour of the fee rise, but might abstain. Shadow business secretary John Denham says it would be ""extraordinary and appalling"" if the secretary of state did not vote for his own proposals. As around 200 students held a protest outside the Sheffield offices of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, the leader of the National Union of Students, Aaron Porter, attacked the Liberal Democrats for failing to keep their promise to vote against raising fees in England. ""The anger felt at this betrayal is real, justified, and desperately disappointing to those who placed in you their hope for a different politics,"" said Mr Porter. In Bristol, where thousands of students from both the city's universities marched, 10 people were arrested after police were pelted with mustard. More than a thousand students protested in the centre of Manchester. In Nottingham, about 150 protesters reportedly staged an occupation at the university and students said they held occupations at Kingston and Sheffield. Sussex Police said around 100 protesters threw missiles from the roof of a car park in Hove, damaging buildings below. And there were also demonstrations, marches, and occupations in Cambridge, Newcastle, Bath, and Cardiff.",Police arrested 153 people during clashes in London on the third day of protests against plans to raise student tuition fees.
"The prototype fretless guitar featured on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow, where it was valued at between £300,000 and £400,000. Experts believe it may have been used to record at least two tracks on the White Album, released in 1968. Auction house Bonhams described it as an ""iconic guitar from a remarkable man"" during bidding in London. Session musician Ray Russell was given the guitar, made by Bartell of Californian, in 1984 by George Harrison, Bonhams said. At the time, Mr Russell was working on music for a film called Water, by Harrison's production company Handmade Films. He told Antiques Roadshow that Harrison asked him to have a go and then said: ""It's doing better for you, why don't you have it."" Kenny Jenkins, of Leeds Beckett University, and Dr Richard Perks, of the University of Kent, both believe the guitar may have been used on the tracks Helter Skelter and Happiness Is A Warm Gun, the auctioneer said. Antiques Roadshow expert Jon Baddeley, who valued the guitar at up to £400,000, said: ""I think in 25 years it's by far the most expensive thing I've ever seen."" Mr Russell continued to regularly play the guitar, he said during an episode filmed at Battle Abbey, East Sussex. ""I never really thought about value, as George being a mate and all that.

"Pigeon racer Sean Malone released the bird on Saturday morning in Cork, in the Republic of Ireland. Instead of stopping back home in Derry, Northern Ireland, it kept going before being found in Bragar, Lewis, more than 200 miles (322km) from its destination. Mr Malone, from Derry, said it was either blown to Lewis on a strong southern wind, or took fright after being chased by a peregrine falcon. He believes it may have flown for eight or longer non-stop before taking a rest. The tame but exhausted bird has been fed and watered by islander Katie MacDonald, who named it Peggy. But when she contacted the pigeon's owner, whose phone number was on a tag on one of its legs, she found out Peggy is actually a male, and the father of three chicks, and has no name. The bird's rescuer and owner are now trying to work out how to return it back to Ireland. Mr Malone said he plans to call the pigeon Lewis once it is back home in Derry. He said: ""There are two reasons why the pigeon ended up where it did. ""There was a strong south wind and it couldn't put its brakes on, basically, or a peregrine chased it out to sea. ""A pigeon will flee for its life if chased by a falcon and they will just keep flying and flying until they hit land again.""",An Irish racing pigeon has shown up in the Western Isles after getting lost.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a ""significant number"" of contacts were being traced and tested and staff at three work places were also being tested with mobile units deployed. She also said she was ""very hopeful that this outbreak will be contained"" and that there was ""no evidence to suggest otherwise"". However, the first minister added: ""Until contact tracing and testing has been completed we cannot be absolutely sure about that."" She asked businesses to be ""extra vigilant"" and said care homes in the areas affected could not have visitors this weekend.

Part of the DG16 postcode area extends over the border to England. NHS Dumfries and Galloway said everyone involved in the outbreak was self-isolating and work was taking place to identify any recent contacts after the cluster was confirmed on Wednesday. Scotland's clinical director Prof Jason Leitch added: ""The initial first case that we were aware of is a health worker from the Carlisle hospital and that may be connected to an outbreak at that hospital, but we can't be sure yet. ""The other two high-risk workplaces are two factories in Dumfries and Galloway and mobile testing units have been sent there today to test all workers."" He later named the factories involved as Young's Seafood and Alpha Solway, which makes PPE. He said the outbreak underlined the need for the public to follow lockdown guidelines and urged anyone with symptoms, particularly in the Dumfries and Galloway area, to come forward for testing. Prof Leitch had previously told BBC Scotland that the Scottish government had not been ""taken aback"" by the new cases, and that outbreak management measures had been put in place to deal with them. ""This is the first one of its kind and therefore it feels a little bit dramatic compared to what we are expecting going forward,"" he said. ""This will be not common but it will happen as we come out of the pandemic. This just feels very important because it is first.""

"The armed men who staged the attack ""must have had support within the security forces,"" Paris based press freedom watchdog Reporters Without borders (RSF) said. ""By attacking the Leader Publications group, this gang wanted to silence one of the main sources of incisive criticism of the current government. We urge foreign diplomats to publicly express their solidarity with the group,"" a statement issued RSF stated. CPJ statement The printing press that publishes three Sinhala and English language newspapaers was destroyed in the fire. Executive Director of New York based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Joel Simon, said the watchdog was appalled by the attack. ""It's time official inquiries into press attacks in Sri Lanka yielded some results, to counteract the message that critical newspapers can be threatened with impunity,"" he was quoted in a statement. The English-language Morning Leader and Sunday Leader, and the Sinhala-language weekly Irudina are known for their critical stances towards Sri Lankan authorities. Sunday Leader editor, Lasantha Wickramatunga, and the group has come under constant attack by the Sri Lanka authorities. Security forces 'involved' Leader of the opposition and the United National Party (UNP), Ranil Wickramasinghe, has said that the attack could not occur without the knowledge of the security forces and the defence ministry. However, the government denied the accusations. Media minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa told journalists in Colombo that opposition leader has made the statement without investigating the facts. The government is concerned whether there is a conspiracy to tarnish Sri Lanka's image by concerned parties. 'Conspiracy' against government The Sri Lankan government has ordered an investigation. However, results of similar inquiries launched in the past two years have yet to be made public Free Media Movement's (FMM) convenor, Sunanada Deshapriya, told the CPJ. The three papers will find another private printing press and continue to publish, Deshapriya said.

"Leader Adam Price has pledged his party will deliver a referendum if they form a government by 2026. One Welsh Labour hopeful, who supports independence, said Plaid's plan would lead to a ""divisive referendum"". The Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have both described the push for independence for Wales as ""dangerous"" and ""uncertain"". Meanwhile, a Welsh Labour spokesperson said the country's future was ""best served in a radically reformed and fairer union"". In a first for the party, Plaid Cymru has pledged to offer an independence vote in its first term if it forms a government following the 6 May vote, if it also got a Senedd majority to back it. However, the power to call any referendum vote to leave the union would ultimately still lie with the UK government. Mr Price said his party would deliver a vision ""that we share"" with Labour independence supporters, adding many supporters were ""frustrated at their party leadership's reluctance to keep pace with the constitutional debate in Wales"". ""Wales needs a pro-independence government, far bolder in its challenge to the UK Government and far better at banging the drum for our nation's best interests,"" he said. January's Welsh Political Barometer poll for ITV Wales and Cardiff University, suggested 22% would vote yes if a referendum was held. Most, 53%, told the poll they would say no, while a quarter of respondents said they did not know. Meanwhile, the pro-independence campaign Yes Cymru has said its membership has jumped from 2,000 at the start of 2020 to more than 17,000. Three of Welsh Labour's candidates standing at the election openly support independence. But one, Dylan Lewis-Rowlands, 19, said Plaid had yet to give a clear picture of what independence might look like for Wales. He said while 51% of Labour supporters in Wales were pro-independence, the majority rejected a ""divisive referendum"" in the next Senedd term, and instead wanted more powers to be devolved to Wales from the UK government. ""We understand that we need to build wales up, prepare Wales for the future so that we can then get the society that we want,"" he said. ""What Wales deserves here is stronger powers, so that we can make the changes we want to make in Wales"". 'Dangerous distraction' Leader of the Welsh Conservative group in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said a focus on independence was a ""dangerous distraction"" during a pandemic, where the focus needed to be on rebuilding the health service and economy. ""At the end of the day, the biggest success story coming out of the Covid crisis is the vaccine rollout that's been delivered across the UK by everyone working together in one union,"" he said. The Welsh Liberal Democrats said that they would put ""recovery first"" rather than the ""chaos"" of independence. ""A vote for independence is a vote for chaos and uncertainty rather than the recovery we desperately need,"" a spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Welsh Labour said it was the ""party of devolution"", but it was ""proudly patriotic"".

"Flamingo Land Ltd, which runs attractions in North Yorkshire, has been named as the preferred developer of a 20-hectare (49-acre) site at West Riverside in Balloch. They have drawn up proposals which include lodges, a boutique hotel, ""glamping pods"" and restaurants. A range of ""high-quality, family-based attractions"" will also be in the plans. Flamingo Land's chief executive, Gordon Gibb, said the masterplan would fit with the aims of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park. 'Fantastic opportunity' He told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme that it would be a ""different type of venture"" to their theme park. ""Being in the beautiful surroundings of the national park, the activities will be swimming and outdoor adrenaline pursuits rather than the rollercoasters and rides and attractions that we have become famous for at Flamingo Land,"" he said. Mr Gibb added: ""We are excited by the prospect of creating a resort in the national park that recognises the importance and sensitivity of the site. ""We see huge potential on the West Riverside and view this as a fantastic opportunity to create a family-oriented attraction that supports the sustainable tourism objectives of the national park. ""Loch Lomond is internationally recognised and opportunities like West Riverside are rare."" Scottish Enterprise, which named Flamingo Land as preferred developer, said the masterplan would build on the success of the nearby Loch Lomond Shores. The shopping and leisure development attracts 1.25m visitors a year. Derek McCrindle, director of the growth sector at Scottish Enterprise, said the West Riverside development could generate long-term economic benefits for Scotland. It could also secure the national park as a key international tourism destination, he added. ""Following a stringent bidding process, Flamingo Land's proposal - Iconic Leisure Resort Loch Lomond - clearly aims to recognise the key sensitivities of developing within Scotland's national park,"" he said. ""This, together with its strong track record in creating visitor attractions - currently home to the third most popular tourist attraction in the UK - made it the developer of choice for this opportunity."" The plans follow a community consultation - known as a ""charrette"" - held in Balloch earlier ths year. Gordon Watson, chief executive of the national park, said: ""A key point that came out of the charrette was the aspiration in the local community to see the West Riverside developed in a way that connects Lomond Shores to the village, to make the most of Balloch as a gateway to Loch Lomond. ""As the planning authority, we look forward to engaging with the developer through the planning process, as they develop their masterplan for the site.""",A site on the shores of Loch Lomond could be turned into a holiday resort by a theme park operator.
"Nick TriggleHealth correspondent@nicktriggleon Twitter The fastest growth is being seen in London and the South East, where the new coronavirus variant is believed to be behind a rise in cases. Normally the UK would expect to see about 1,000 new respiratory-related admissions a day in total at this time of year. It is already close to double that for Covid alone. University College London clinical research director Prof Christina Pagel says the situation is ""alarming"". She predicts that by the end of next week, the NHS could exceed the total numbers seen in hospital in the peak in the spring, putting immense strain on the NHS at the busiest time of year. Why staffing Nightingales is the problem The growing pressure has prompted many to start wondering why the Nightingales have not been opened. Tory MP John Redwood has been vocal on Twitter calling for them to be put to use. These, after all, were the network of emergency field hospitals built during the spring to cope when hospitals could not - most were not used. There are seven in England. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales established their own field hospitals but these were not known as Nightingales. Wales has now decomissioned its 2,000-bed field hospital, which was at the Principality Stadium, although it has a network of smaller sites are now available, some of which are linked to existing hospitals. A number of these are treating Covid patients. But of the original sites only two - one in Exeter and one in Belfast - are currently taking Covid patients. Manchester's is being used for non-Covid patients who are in the final stages of recovery, while the centres in Harrogate and Glasgow are carrying out diagnostic tests and outpatient appointments. Why, if the NHS is under so much pressure, are others not open? The simple answer, says British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul, is staffing. ""We have 80,000 vacancies. You just can't have a doctor or nurse in two sites at once."" It is a sentiment that is echoed on the ground. Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor in east London, said the situation in the capital as well as in north Kent and south Wales ""remains very difficult"". But he says the Nightingales will not help because of the lack of trained staff. ""We are already 'diluting' our skilled ICU nursing staff with less-well-trained volunteers."" How hospitals are managing demand without them The truth is they were built as an insurance option - to be used as a last resort. So instead hospitals have focused on managing demand. That means a ruthless prioritisation of care. Routine work, such as knee and hip replacements, has been cancelled in the areas that are facing the most pressure to free up space. That is why it is no coincidence - despite the variation in Covid cases across the country - that regionally, hospitals have very similar levels of occupied beds once you take into account Covid and non-Covid patients. Hospitals have been carefully managing demand to ensure they have a bit of wriggle room available. But there is, of course, a limit to how long that can work. Even then though doubts remain about how much use the Nightingales will be. As well as staffing, some have argued there is just not the equipment available to treat the sickest patients, who can suffer everything from blood clotting to multiple organ failure. ""We can given them oxygen, but that's about it,"" said one doctor who worked in one of the Nightingales in the first wave. ""In some there are not even appropriate toilet facilities. They were built in a rush because we were desperate."" Will they ever be used en masse? Despite the problems, Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, believes it was still the right decision to build them. ""Remember in the spring, Italian hospitals in Lombardy were overwhelmed. ""We needed an insurance policy in case that happened."" He says even without the complex equipment, they could still have a role given many patients are now treated on general wards with oxygen therapy. But he says the NHS will use ""every ounce"" of existing capacity it can muster before the Nightingales are used routinely. He predicts the next 10 to 15 days will be crucial - and if the numbers coming into hospital do not start dropping, hospitals could find themselves getting very close to the limit. ""If we don't end up using them, we should think of that as a success,"" he added.

"The 33-year-old marketing executive disappeared as she walked home in Clapham on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in Kent woodland. Serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her murder and kidnap. Police cordoned off a section of The Rope Walk, near the centre of Sandwich, on Sunday evening. Scotland Yard said police had routinely been searching areas of London and Kent as part of the investigation. On Sunday, Sandwich Town Council said it was in contact with Kent Police on behalf of Scotland Yard. Earlier, the mayor of Sandwich estimated that about one square mile of the town had been taped off. Police officers are continuing to search along Delf stream and The Rope Walk with metre-long wooden sticks. Officers are also searching a trolley shelter at a Co-op supermarket. The cordoned-off area contains a secluded path near a stream and homes. At the edge of the cordon, a few officers gathered for discussion as one showed colleagues a piece of gold jewellery that was then put in an evidence bag. Residents have been asked not to gather at the scene. Ms Everard was reported missing by her boyfriend on 4 March. She had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home.

"For the first time in more than 130 years, adults aged 18 to 34 are more likely to live in their parents' home than with a partner. The study by Pew Research Center indicates 32.1% living with parents in 2014, 31.6% living with a spouse or partner, and 14% living alone. It says demographical shifts in marital status and employment are behind it. ""This turn of events is fuelled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young Americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35,"" says the Pew report. Historically, the most common living arrangement for young adults was living with a partner - in 1960 nearly two-thirds of young Americans were doing so, and only one in five lived with a parent. Since then, the median age of the first marriage has risen steadily, with some postponing it all together. In addition, says the research, as employment among young men has fallen, and wages remain stagnant, so the number who are living with parents has risen.

"By Del CrookesNewsbeat reporter A US official, briefed by the country's Justice Department, told the AP News Agency that the band had made it out of the Bataclan music venue, where they'd been performing. At least 80 people were killed at the former theatre. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up as police moved in and another was shot dead by security forces. Who are Eagles of Death Metal? The band was put together by frontman Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme in 1998 in Palm Desert, California. Josh Homme doesn't play too many live gigs because of his other commitments to Queens of the Stone Age and Them Crooked Vultures. Eagles of Death Metal released the first single, Complexity, from their new album in August. He wasn't at the Paris gig, according to a publicist for the Eagles' record label. The band's sound is a mix of blues rock and garage rock. They released their fourth studio album, Zipper Down, last month. Touring members of the band include drummer Julian Dorio, guitarists Dave Catching and Eden Galindo plus bassist Matt McJunkins. They're due to play more dates this year in European cities including Munich, Stockholm, Rome and Barcelona as well as another gig in Tourcoing, France, on Saturday night. What do we know about the band's Bataclan gig? Reports suggest Eagles were about an hour into their set when the attack on the venue began. The wife of the band's drummer, Julian Dorio, Emily told the Washington Post that all members of the group had made it out alive. ""He called to say that he loved me and he was safe,"" said Emily Dorio. ""Everyone on stage was able to get off. ""We are just holding our breath and saying prayers for everyone."" The drummer's mother Mary Lou Dorio also said they were safe but that several crew members were unaccounted for. She said Julian had made it to a local police station and had spoken to his wife. Earlier in the evening a post on the band's Facebook page said: ""We are still currently trying to determine the safety and whereabouts of all our band and crew. Our thoughts are with all of the people involved in this tragic situation."" Earlier in the day the band went sight seeing in Paris. Julian Dorio posted this picture on Instagram from outside Notre Dame. Which other acts were playing in Paris on Friday night? Eagles of Death Metal's support act Red Lemons posted a message on Facebook saying they were safe after ending their bit of the gig. ""For our American and English friends, a terrorist attack happened at the Eagles of death metal concert. ""We are safe. Mikel Ross, Eric McFadden we were with your mates Jesse, Tuesday, the other musicians outside, they're safe too, they took a cab."" Keith Murray from We Are Scientists was at the gig but left before the attacks happened. Deftones, who had been due to play at the Bataclan on Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights, were also at the venue but say they're safe. ""Thank for all your inquiries on our well being,"" they said on Facebook. ""Band/Crew all safe and accounted for at this time. Prayers for those affected in these tragic events."" Wolf Alice posted this message on Twitter saying they were OK. Other bands in Paris on Saturday night - Wolf Alice, MS MR, Thundercat and Kamasi - all say they're safe too. What do we know about the Bataclan venue? The Bataclan is a theatre located in eastern Paris near the trendy Oberkampf area. It's used for a variety of concerts and other events and was renovated with new outside colours in 2006. It used to be a cinema but was transformed into a theatre in 1969. US band Cold War Kids have played at the Bataclan venue before. They say it's the place in France everyone wants to play. The venue has now turned its Facebook profile picture black after Friday night's events. Rudimental had been due to play there next Thursday as had Lianne La Havas and German heavy metal band Accept in December.

"The new entry tests for people wanting to become teachers were developed by a panel of heads and experts following complaints current tests were too easy. Education Secretary Michael Gove says the ""rigorous selection"" of trainees is key to raising standards. Here a selection of individuals involved in teaching and education organisations give their opinions on the forthcoming changes facing new teachers: Brett Wigdortz, Teach First I welcome efforts to ensure that all teachers have the potential to be excellent teachers and to raise the status of the teaching profession. We have set a high bar for entry to our leadership development programme and these tests will form part of the selection process. Our teachers work in schools where the majority of pupils come from the country's least advantaged communities. It is important that they have levels of numeracy and literacy which enable them to support pupils learning, regardless of the subject they teach. It is, of course, not just about literacy and numeracy. By the time our teachers get to take these tests they have already been through a rigorous assessment process which tests for key attributes which are essential ingredients for being an excellent teacher, such as resilience, leadership and humility, respect and empathy. Beyond initial teacher training, it is essential that all teachers have access to high quality continuing professional development (CPD) courses. This is so that they can continue to develop their skills and subject knowledge throughout their careers. Sheila Cooper, Girls' Schools Association High levels of numeracy and literacy are of course vital for all teachers and should be expected; but this is not going to solve the real problem which is attracting more high quality graduates into the profession. What we need is for teachers to be viewed and valued as highly skilled professionals in the same way as are our lawyers and medics. Expecting trainee teachers to sit specific numeracy and literacy tests will not send out the right messages to attract the calibre of teachers we expect to join the profession. If there is an issue with teachers falling short in these skills then perhaps the selection process to enter teacher training needs to be addressed. Sir Peter Lampl, Sutton Trust I welcome today's plans to toughen English and maths tests for new teachers. All teachers should have a firm grasp of the basics. Too often the importance of maths, in particular, is underrated. Yet it is increasingly essential in every walk of life. But the priority must be to upgrade the skills of the 440,000-strong existing workforce, not just in English and maths, but in wider teaching skills. Sutton Trust research has shown that England would become one of the top five education performers in the world within 10 years if the performance of the country's least effective 10th of teachers were brought up to the national average. Verity O'Keefe, EEF - the manufacturers' organisation Employers want to see a quality workforce of teachers and we must develop such a workforce if we are to compete with the best the world can offer. Introducing more rigorous testing, with tougher questions that test candidates' use of English and banning calculators when testing numeracy skills, will give businesses confidence that the government is serious about producing more highly-skilled teachers that are able to teach the next generation of workers to the best possible standards. We know that many employers look for educational attainment in key subjects such as English and maths when recruiting young people, but to drive such attainment we must also address the quality of how these subjects are being taught. Knowing that teachers are required to pass rigorous tests in numeracy and literacy will be welcome news to employers. EEF recently set a benchmark for 65% of school-leavers to achieve five GCSE A*-C grades including English and maths by 2015. If we want young people to be achieving such levels of attainment then it is more than reasonable for prospective teachers to be achieving what is equivalent to a grade B at GCSE. Of course government could still do more, including getting more teachers with specialist knowledge of Stem [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] subjects and top class degrees into schools. Dr Helen Wright, St Mary's Calne, Wiltshire Our children deserve the very, very best teachers. The first and most important conclusion of the 2007 McKinsey Report into high-performing school systems was that the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers. In fact, this is commonsense: our teachers have to be exceptional if they are going to teach and educate exceptionally well. Teaching should be a hard profession to get into, and the qualifications to become a teacher should be high; we should not be responding to a shortage of teachers by lowering standards, but by making it an attractive profession in other ways - respected, well-salaried, well-resourced. By all means raise the entry-level standards - our children can only benefit in the long run.","Teacher trainees in England are to face tougher tests in English, mathematics and reasoning after the government said it wanted to raise the quality and standing of the profession."
"By Michael SteiningerBBC News, Berlin Clinics in Hamburg, Kiel and Luebeck are operating at the limit and have had to request extra help from medics in the south of the country. Intensive care and dialysis units are particularly short of trained personnel. German Health Minister Daniel Bahr said some hospitals had to deal with ""bottlenecks"" in providing sufficient numbers of staff. About 2,000 people have been infected with the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) bacteria. More than 600 of those have developed haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to bloody diarrhoea, kidney failure, neurological damage and death. Most HUS patients - 70% - are women. Treating HUS is a time-consuming procedure. Patients have to have their blood plasma exchanged to get rid of the toxic substances released by the EHEC bacteria into the system. Those people whose kidneys have been affected need dialysis on top. Both procedures require specialist equipment and staff. Blood plasma is being brought in from other regions as reserves in northern Germany ran out a few days after the outbreak started. Confusion Oliver Grieve, spokesman for the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, which runs clinics in Luebeck and Kiel, told the BBC he had never encountered a similar situation in his professional career. ""We have enough equipment and drugs at the moment. But the super-human effort made by our doctors, nurses and service personnel is beyond description,"" Mr Grieve said. Patients in Hamburg report a growing sense of confusion and insecurity. A young woman infected with EHEC told Spiegel magazine that her family, including her children, were being treated like outcasts. ""It's cruel, it is like being outlawed,"" she said. Another woman, the mother of a young baby, described how three hospitals gave her different advice on feeding her child. ""One clinic ordered instant isolation from my baby, another said I should just stop breastfeeding, a third said I should carry on as usual. [The conflicting advice] is worse than the swine flu."" Health Minister Mr Bahr visited hospitals in northern Germany on Sunday to see the effects of the outbreak first hand. He has invited fellow officials from all the German states to attend an emergency meeting in Berlin on Wednesday. But in recent days he has drawn criticism from several sides for his handling of the outbreak. The opposition Green party complained Mr Bahr and the health authorities at the state level had underestimated the crisis. And the German Consumers Association said that conflicting messages coming from the federal and state governments had confused people and added to a sense of panic. ""They [the government] were really caught off guard,"" Ralf Beste, political correspondent for the Spiegel newspaper, told the BBC World Service. ""The health minister was just installed a few weeks ago, and he felt he had different problems with the health system, and now he has a food crisis."" ""With Germany being a federal country, there are 16 health and 16 agricultural ministers, so there is not much of a co-ordinated effort visible to the German consumers."" The authorities are keen to point out that it is still safe to eat vegetables as long as certain basic rules of hygiene are followed: people should wash their hands and their food thoroughly, and for the time being stay away from certain fresh vegetables sold in northern Germany. End in sight? There is hope though. While scientists believe they have isolated bean sprouts coming from a farm in Lower Saxony as the source of the EHEC germs, hospitals have seen a decrease in new infections. Sunday was the first day in a month that all new patients admitted at University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein tested negative for EHEC, said spokesman Oliver Grieve, while on previous days there had been dozens of new infections each day. ""And it was the first time that we could release HUS patients, who are now stable enough to go home and continue treatment there,"" Mr Grieve said. ""Maybe, but only maybe, we have seen the climax of this outbreak.""",Hospital staff in northern Germany are working overtime to treat the large number of patients infected with an aggressive form of E. coli that has left 22 people dead so far.
"By Mark SmithTechnology of Business reporter When it sets off on its arctic explorations, the Royal Research Ship (RSS) David Attenborough will be carrying within it a full complement of autonomous flying and submersible vehicles designed to lay bare the mysteries of the polar regions. One underwater drone or AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) that may be aboard come launch day bears the name Boaty McBoatface, the quirky moniker chosen for its mother ship in an online poll which was subsequently overruled. Boaty is designed to dive to 6,000m (19,700 ft) where the pressure is about 600 times greater than at sea level. Less rugged vehicles would be crushed completely at those depths. It comes equipped with a payload of sensors, imaging equipment, sonar, hydrophones and communications kit to gather data on changing deep ocean temperatures and their potential impact on climate change. One of the toughest challenges its National Oceanography Centre designers faced was being able to build a craft that could travel long distances under the ice without needing to recharge. Recent advances in microprocessors, much of it driven by smartphone technology, has helped change that by reducing the amount of power these drones need to run. ""The vehicle is designed to draw a very small amount of power for its propulsion systems,"" explains Dr Maaten Furlong, head of marine autonomous and robotics systems at the National Oceanography Centre. ""As a result it travels at a relatively slow speed, which in turn enables it to cover huge distances and carry out extended missions compared to vehicles that have gone before."" Early last year, Boaty - or the Autosub Long Range (ALR) to give it its proper name - completed its first full under-ice expedition at the Filchner Ice Shelf in West Antarctica, where it spent a total of 51 hours under the Antarctic ice, travelling 108km (67 miles). More Technology of Business It reached depths of 944m, at one time travelling under a section of ice shelf 550m thick. GPS signals can't penetrate so far down, so navigation is tricky. Instead, it has to use dead reckoning. By using a point of origin - such as the mother ship - it estimates the direction and distance travelled, calculating speed by bouncing sound off the seabed and measuring the echoes. Its fibre-optic gyro-based sensor has an error rate of 0.1%, which means for every kilometre travelled it could drift one metre off course, the designers say. But to explore even further and deeper, new navigation tech will be required. And this is under development. Called Terrain Aided Navigation, this system essentially maps the sea floor, and these maps are loaded in to the vehicle's computer. Ultimately, the designers hope the robots will be able to ""see"" well enough to create their own maps in real time. ""A long-term ambition for the ALR family of vehicles is to deliver on the potential and the ambition to complete a full trans-Arctic mission under ice, an environment about which we know very little at this point. ""This will require the new Terrain Aided Navigation techniques being developed to be fully operational."" Arctic sub-sea conditions are pretty tough, but the surface of planet Mars is even tougher, bringing with it a whole new set of design challenges. Two devices being developed by Nasa to survey the volcanic bowels of the red planet are currently being trialled on Earth, with their designers envisaging uses much closer to home. Lemur - short for Limbed Excursion Mechanical Utility Robot - is a four-limbed machine that can scale rock walls, gripping with hundreds of tiny hooks in each of its 16 fingers. Engineers from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Labs took Lemur on a field test in California's Death Valley in January, where it used artificial intelligence to choose a route up a cliff. Nasa's Dr Aaron Parness says Lemur's rock-climbing abilities could be used for search and rescue operations to help disaster relief teams. Finding claws that wouldn't wear down on the rock was a challenge. ""We looked at titanium, steel, carbon fibre, carbide, tool steel,"" says Dr Parness. ""We tried sewing needles to sail boat needles, syringes, lathe tools, even harvesting cactus spines."" The winning solution? Fishing hooks. ""Turns out that industry is really good at making things sharp, strong, and durable,"" he says. Nasa's other tough robot is Volcanobot, a relatively low-cost device designed to be lowered in to fissures and survive extreme heat. On a trial mission to the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii, it mapped the conduits of previous eruptions to get an understanding of how that style of volcano works underground. But building machines that can navigate over harsh terrain as well as deal with extreme temperatures has proven tough. Volcanic rock ""is extremely sharp and hard,"" explains Dr Parness. ""If you walk a mile of two across a lava flow, the soles of your shoes will be 100% trashed."" So Volcanotbot uses carbon-fibre infused material in its 3D-printed parts to make them stronger and more resistant to abrasion. ""It gets scratched up like crazy, but protects the electronics inside,"" he says. While the team has created casings and materials that can withstand 300C, the weak link is the electronics inside, which ""tend to fail around 60-80C"". ""It didn't help to have a strong robot shell protecting dead robot guts!"" Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan has developed a team of automated firefighting robots designed to cope with extreme heat. Equipped with GPS and laser sensors to help them navigate to the scene of the fire, a water cannon robot takes up a position then the hose extension drone drives to the water source, laying out hose along the ground. The water cannon can then unleash its payload, squirting up to 4,000 litres per minute. The system was put through its first trial in March at Tokyo's National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster, with its designers envisaging their use in highly volatile environments such as petro-chemical blazes. A spokesman for the design team said the aim is for the robots to fully-autonomous in time. Robotics expert Prof Barry Lennox says that reduced construction costs, better materials and improved sensors are driving the development of tough drones around the world. ""Over the next five to 10 years I would expect to see even more complex environments being explored,"" he says.","From arctic wastes to fiery volcanoes, ocean depths to distant planets, a new generation of rugged drones is going to places humans can't. But how do you make a super-tough drone?"
"Michelle O'Neill made the announcement as she outlined a list of businesses which must close temporarily to slow the spread of Covid-19. Ms O'Neill said she accepted there had been ""confusion"" around the position of construction workers. She said the issue would be kept under review. Speaking at the Northern Ireland Executive's daily coronavirus update, Ms O'Neill said all ""non-essential"" businesses should close. Earlier on Tuesday, the Construction Employers Federation (CEF) in Northern Ireland said all non-essential building work should stop. The government has published details on jobs deemed to be essential following the introduction of stricter social distancing rules introduced on Monday. The CEF, which represents Northern Ireland's major building firms, said: ""Following the statement by the prime minister last night [Monday], it is our view that, with the exception of essential works in support of the fight against Covid-19, non-essential construction work should cease."" It defines essential construction as work supporting health, emergency services and other works essential to the safety of the public.","Building sites can operate during the coronavirus pandemic, as long as they obey social distancing guidelines, the deputy first minister has said."
"Farooq Abdullah is now detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA), which among other things, allows detention without formal charge for two years. He had previously been under house arrest along with other leaders ahead of a move to strip Kashmir of its special status in August. His detention has been criticised. Many, including veteran journalists and politicians, have condemned the move as ""draconian"" and argued that it sets a dangerous precedent. ""If an 81-year-old politician is seen as a threat to public safety then it flies in the face of the government claim that the situation in the Kashmir valley is returning to normal,"" senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai said in a television programme that is being widely shared on social media. The leader of the the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPIM) Sitaram Yechury called the decision a ""cowardly afterthought"" and said that Mr Abdullah had ""supported India through thick and thin"". Salman Khurshid, a leader with the main opposition Congress party, said that Mr Abdullah had ""upheld the unity and integrity"" of India. Regional politician MK Stalin tweeted that the move was ""excessive, arbitrary and unlawful"". The announcement that Mr Abdullah would now be detained under the PSA came hours after a regional politician from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Vaiko, filed an application in the Supreme Court, asking for Mr Abdullah to be produced before the court. He had said that there were ""competing claims"" about where Mr Abdullah - a member of India's upper house of parliament - was. The court, in turn, asked the government to respond by 30 September. Earlier, Home Minister Amit Shah had told parliament that Mr Abdullah was ""not detained"". He was responding to criticism that the government had not followed procedure in informing parliament about the arrest of a member of the house beforehand. Correspondents say the decision to detain Mr Abdullah could well be an attempt to pre-empt any court decision compelling the government to release him even for a few days, as this could be used as a precedent to release other people currently under detention. The government is believed to have detained thousands of people including activists, local politicians and businessmen. Many have been shifted to jails in cities outside the region. However, there has been some social media support for the government's decision as well. The government has not made any public statement regarding the order to detain Mr Abdullah under the PSA.",The detention of a veteran Kashmiri parliamentarian and former chief minister under a controversial law has generated heated debate in India.
"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen thanked Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal. The numbers per country have not been announced yet - German media spoke of up to 1,500 in total. They are children categorised as unaccompanied and/or very sick. Greece's migrant camps are overcrowded. Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees are stuck at Turkey's land border with Greece, where Greek border guards have fired tear gas and water cannon to keep them out. Many are Syrians fleeing the civil war, but there are also Afghans, Pakistanis and West Africans seeking a new life in the EU. In addition, in the past week more than 1,700 have landed on Lesbos and some other Greek Aegean islands on boats from Turkey. Some angry locals have resorted to violence on Lesbos, where existing migrant camps are squalid and struggling to cope. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will hold talks in Brussels on Monday evening with European Council President Charles Michel and Commission President von der Leyen. At a news conference, Ms von der Leyen said Turkey must move the asylum seekers away from the land border, as part of a solution to the migrant crisis. But she also said ""we expect fundamental rights to be upheld, including the right to asylum"". She was apparently reminding Greece of its responsibilities, after the authorities there, struggling with the new influx, decided to suspend handling any new asylum claims for a month. The latest surge in numbers at the Greek border came after Turkey announced last weekend that it would no longer stop them trying to enter Greece. A 2016 deal with the EU aimed at curbing illegal migration from Turkey is under severe strain. The EU is anxious to prevent a repeat of the 2015 crisis, when about a million asylum seekers reached Central Europe via Greece and the Balkans. Turkey has urged the EU to do much more to ease the refugee burden, as it is already housing 3.7 million Syrian refugees in camps, while another million Syrians are desperate to get in, having fled fighting in the Idlib area. Ms von der Leyen said ""we recognise Turkey is doing a great deal, looking after millions of refugees, with our help. ""We need to talk very clearly about the fact that what happened last weekend cannot happen again. We need a future-proof strategy to ensure such escalations don't happen again.""","Five EU countries have agreed to take in some migrant children who are stuck in Greece, amid continuing tension on the Greek-Turkish border."
"Stratton - who has worked for both ITV and the BBC and is Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spokeswoman - will become the government's new press secretary. The daily updates, similar to the format used by the White House in the United States, will start next month. Boris Johnson has said the briefings will allow the public more ""direct engagement"" with the government. The change comes after a raft of televised press conferences from Downing Street during the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, political journalists are able to question the prime minister's official spokesperson - who is a civil servant - off camera every day. These briefings are on the record, meaning they can be quoted and attributed to the spokesperson, who is never named. Under the changes, the briefings will be on camera. Stratton's role, however, is a political appointment by the Conservative Party, although as a special adviser her wages will be paid by the taxpayer. The BBC's deputy political editor, Vicki Young, said the government wanted to introduce the briefings to ""try and get their message out there to viewers"". But she said the idea was controversial, as it would not be updates from an elected official. After the plan was announced in July, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it could risk ""unbalancing the political discourse"" and was ""obviously a political move"". Labour announced that their leader would take questions from the media at monthly press conferences, with a spokesman saying Sir Keir ""doesn't duck the difficult questions or hide from the press"". But Downing Street said ministers would make regular appearances at the briefings to be led by Stratton. Who is Allegra Stratton? Stratton graduated from Cambridge university and began her journalistic career as a producer at the BBC. She then became a political correspondent for the Guardian, before returning to the BBC as the political editor of Newsnight. She left the BBC to become the national editor at ITV News, and co-presented Peston on Sunday. But earlier this year, she quit journalism to become the director of strategic communications for Chancellor Rishi Sunak. When the job was advertised on the Conservative Party LinkenIn page it said the salary would be ""based on experience"", but the Daily Telegraph suggested it was likely to be more than £100,000-a-year. Stratton will be employed as a special adviser - a temporary class of civil servant allowed to give political advice to ministers. This means she will be free to attack the opposition parties, as well as setting out the government's position. Her daily briefings will take place in a redeveloped 9 Downing Street, which in recent years has been used by the chief whip and the Brexit secretary.","Former journalist Allegra Stratton will lead No 10's new daily televised press briefings, BBC sources understand."
"Tom FeildenScience correspondent, Today It looks like a smear of clumsily spilt black ink, or perhaps (for the more romantically minded), a rip in the star-studded cloak of the cosmos. But look a little closer - as the European Southern Observatory's 2.2 metre MPG telescope at La Silla in Chile has done - and a striking image of an immense swirling cloud of interstellar dust and gas begins to emerge. Known as Lupus 3 this dense dark cloud lies some 600 light years from earth in the constellation Scorpius. And just to give you some idea of its size the main V-shaped splodge to the left of the central cluster of bright stars is some five light-years across. Still waters run deep however, and far from indicating a lack of activity this black and apparently empty patch of the night sky hides a maelstrom of star forming activity. Behind the scenes, dense swirls of cold dark dust are clumping together, heating up and beginning to shine as they condense under the force of gravity. Viewed at longer wavelengths, and in the infrared, Lupus 3 shines like a torch, but it's not until the stars get hotter and brighter - clearing the clouds around them as the cluster of brilliant blue stars in the centre have done - that they emerge in all their glory. There's more to Lupus 3, and star formation, than meets the eye.",A new image from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) provides a remarkable insight into star formation.
"By Bill WilsonBusiness reporter, BBC News Sir John Armitt has overseen thousands of Games-related contracts, worth billions of pounds, since he took the helm at the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) five years ago. During that time, the ODA has overseen the delivery of everything from the building of sporting arenas and other infrastructure to the ordering of plastic cups and fire shutters. Now, as the preparations for the Olympics enter their final lap, Sir John is looking to ensure the event acts as a catalyst for companies to win similar sports-related contracts in future. 'Longer-lasting benefits' ""The UK and its firms has a couple of years to really capitalise on the expertise and experience gained from being involved in this summer's Games,"" Sir John told the BBC News website. ""But there are longer-lasting benefits - you can still see how Australian firms are winning sports-related contracts because the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney was seen as a good one. ""Clearly the opportunities now exist for us, but we need to match the Australians and make sure they don't dominate."" Sir John is now heading up the British Business Club, a new sports business networking organisation backed by UK Trade & Investment (UKTI). It will be active for the duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and beyond, and is also open to overseas firms as well as UK ones. ""It is a powerful business networking tool for both British and international firms,"" says Sir John. ""By allowing companies to build their networks and connect with business partners worldwide, it will increase their opportunities to meet and engage with potential partners during the London 2012 Games."" Rio contact Sir John said UK firms were particularly well placed to win sports contracts in the Middle East, India and South East Asia. But he said challenges still remained in Africa and South America, although London 2012 had been building good contacts with the organisers of the 2016 Rio Games. ""There have been a lot of meetings and conversations, and UK firms are doing a lot of the Rio masterplanning,"" he said. ""Having done something successful here should provide extra leverage for UK firms."" According to Sir John, some 98% of the facilities for the Olympics have been built by UK firms. That is almost £6bn worth of business, or 1,500 contracts, awarded by the ODA to home-based companies. In total, more than 75,000 firms are expected to have win work related to London 2012. Now they will be looking to win similar work in the coming decade. As well as the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and Winter Olympics in Sochi, both in 2014, there are a number of other big events looming on the global sporting calendar. They include a number of UK-based events, including the Rugby League World Cup in 2013, Rugby Union World Cup in 2015, the Ryder Cup in 2014 and the Cricket World Cup. Major overseas events include the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil, as well as the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. ""British companies now have precious experience that they can use to win business at home and abroad,"" added Sir John. ""They are already doing so in Sochi and Brazil. Further ahead, there are fresh opportunities in Korea and Qatar,"" he says, referring to the latter's seemingly insatiable appetite for hosting major sporting events. Joining UKTI in launching the initiative are London & Partners, London Business Network and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It is hoped the venture will be particularly useful for small and medium-sized enterprises. Club members can network free of charge with thousands of other businesses ""to showcase their expertise and know-how"" by creating an online profile. The website will also provide access to one-to-one meetings, networking events across the UK and free temporary membership of the Institute of Directors in London for the duration of the Games. Mr Armitt hit the headlines recently when he called for ""urgent action to ensure that marketing restrictions applying to London 2012 suppliers are relaxed as soon as possible"" after the Games. He made the point after small and medium-sized firms said they were not allowed to publicise their success, because the event's organisers (Locog) feared it could upset the big-name official sponsors. ""We are seeking post-Games relief for firms from these constraints and are in discussions to see that can be done after the Olympics,"" said Sir John. 'Feel-good' There has been a glut of analysis from, among others, Lloyds, Goldman Sachs and the government, all trying to size up the exact economic benefit that the UK can expect from holding the games. Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron said hosting the Games would be worth £13bn to the UK economy over the next four years. ""The 'value' can only be the one that makes people feel good - the Olympic Games will help the feel-good factor,"" says Sir John. ""But if you are a government that has just spent £9bn on the games, it is unacceptable to spend £9bn on just a six-week party. ""Of course, there are social and sporting legacy benefits from the Games - but you want to feel sure there is a business benefit. ""But you will never know the scale of those business benefits."" He said no-one could predict if the global economic situation would change dramatically over the next four or five years. ""It will be a brave man that says 15% of economic growth was because of this factor, and 20% because of this factor. ""The main question is - have we, because of the Games, increased GDP, got people into work and put the UK economy in a better position? ""Intuitively I know these things are going to happen. For me, that is enough. I am not myself concerned about trying to find out whatever percentage was created by the Games.""","The UK has to emulate Australia when it comes to winning sports-related business contracts, says the man behind the London 2012 Olympic Games infrastructure programme."
"Most of the observed changes resulting from climate change concern natural systems, such as water resources, sea levels or biodiversity. But changes to human systems such as food production and livelihoods have also been attributed to global warming. The report has medium confidence that global warming is altering patterns of rainfall or melting snow and ice, and that this is affecting water resources in terms of both quality and quantity. The scientists also have high confidence that wildlife on land, in the rivers and in the oceans have shifted their geographic ranges, migration patterns and seasonal behaviour. Few extinctions have been tied to man-made global warming so far, but the report points out that much slower episodes of climate change over millions of years caused significant ecosystem changes and the disappearance of numerous species. Previous studies have shown a mixture of impacts on food production, with some areas benefiting from changes, while others are hit hard. The authors say with high confidence that the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive ones. ""Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation of response."" Throughout history, people have tried to cope with a changing climate - with varying degrees of success, the report says. The document says that governments at various levels are beginning to develop adaptation plans and integrate climate considerations into existing programmes such as disaster risk management and water management. The authors then present summaries of the steps different regions are taking to adapt to climate change. Progress has been variable. In Africa, for example, governments have started to build systems for disaster risk management and are taking basic public health measures. But it points out that such efforts have tended to be isolated so far. In Europe, adaptation policies have been developed across all levels of government, while in North America, ""incremental"" planning is taking place, with some proactive adaptation to protect long-term investments in energy infrastructure. Oceania's adaptation efforts have been focused around sea level rise, and in southern Australia, on water scarcity. The report stresses the importance of adaptation, explaining that the ways in which societies respond will influence the risks of climate change throughout the 21st Century. But the report warns that the effectiveness of adaptation can be limited. Continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate impacts, as well as the long timeframes involved, complicate the decision-making process. The report lays out a number of principles for effective adaptation. For example, planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions by different governments. ""The overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change."" In other words, we might not need to adapt so much if we tackle the causes of climate change itself. The risks associated with global warming are lessened under low temperature rise projections compared with those applying under the highest projections. However, under all the different temperature scenarios in the future, some risk from adverse impacts remains. The document outlines the key risks of continued warming, according to criteria such as their magnitude, probability, or irreversibility. They have also been designed to comply with article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which refers to ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". The eight key risks refer to possible deaths, injuries and health impacts associated with, for example, flooding in low-lying coastal zones or heat waves. The breakdown of infrastructure following extreme weather events; the disruption of food production and supply; and the negative impact on communities that depend on threatened ecosystems - such as coastal fisheries - also make the list. Furthermore, these risks are grouped into a smaller number of categories known as ""reasons for concern"". These include singular events, such as loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which would raise the sea level by a staggering seven metres. ""Climate change is projected to amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks for natural and human systems."" Some of the risks associated with climate change will be limited to particular sectors or regions of the world, but some will have cascading effects. The latter half of the report contains more detail on these impacts. The fraction of the global population experiencing water scarcity and the proportion affected by major river floods are expected to increase with the level of warming over the 21st Century. In addition, coastal and low-lying areas will experience submergence, flooding and erosion due to sea-level rise. Land-based and freshwater wildlife species face an increased risk of extinction under the projected climate change scenarios for the century, especially as global warming interacts with other factors such as habitat changes, exploitation by humans, and invasive species. Under the high emissions scenarios, there is a ""high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change"" to those same ecosystems. Fish and other marine animals will shift their ranges, causing invasions of high-latitude seas by low latitude species and local extinctions of marine animals in the tropics. This poses the risk of reduced supplies of fish with consequences for incomes and employment. Ocean acidification also poses substantial risks to marine ecosystems, particularly at the poles and at coral reefs. For the major food crops, such as wheat, rice and maize, in tropical and temperate regions, global warming without adaptation is projected to negatively affect production for temperature rises of 2C or more above 20th Century levels. While positive effects are also expected, all aspects of food security are potentially impacted by climate change. The report says the impacts on the global economy are difficult to estimate, but continued warming is expected to slow down economic growth, making efforts to tackle poverty more difficult. Human health and security - in the form of increased migration, increased conflict and implications for territorial integrity from, for example, inundation of land by rising seas - will also be affected by climate change.

Toby, from Osmondthorpe, Leeds, became ill at Christmas 2016 and on his fourth birthday in January 2017 his family was told he had a stage four neuroblastoma tumour. Doctors told him he would need intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as an operation to remove the main tumour on his kidney. He died on 12 January, just days after his birthday. Leeds captain Liam Cooper, who once carried Toby on to the pitch at Elland Road, developed a close relationship with the youngster.

"The seasonal outing of ITV's popular period drama will be screened at 20:30 GMT - the same time as BBC One's flagship soap. Doctor Who will be screened at 19:30 GMT, going head to head with an hour-long Coronation Street on ITV. Downton's third Christmas special sees the action shift to 1923 and has US actor Paul Giamatti joining the cast. The two-hour episode centres on the Crawleys' wayward family member Rose being presented at Buckingham Palace, a grand occasion that sees Cora's mother Martha - played by Shirley MacLaine - return to the drama. It will also see Giamatti makes his Downton debut as Martha's brother Harold, who was in trouble with the law at the end of the last series. The show's producers are keeping tight-lipped about the fate of Lady Edith and her pregnancy, saying only that she is ""wrestling with a moral dilemma"". Last year's Christmas Day special climaxed in the unexpected death of Downton heir Matthew Crawley, leaving behind his wife, Lady Mary, and their newborn son. Its first hour overlapped with EastEnders in 2012. Final audience figures gave EastEnders the edge, scoring 11.2 million viewers over Downton's 10.2 million. This year the second hour of Downton Abbey's seasonal special will be up against BBC One sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys. The Christmas Day episode of Doctor Who will see Matt Smith battle deadly enemies, including the Daleks and the Cybermen, before regenerating into Peter Capaldi. In BBC One's schedule, the sci-fi drama finds itself sandwiched between Call the Midwife and EastEnders. Albert Square will see the arrival of a new landlord for the Queen Vic pub, Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer. The ongoing murder storyline involving Janine Butcher is also expected to figure highly in EastEnders' hour-long special.

"Officers were called to the courtyard outside St Peter's Court - which houses University of Nottingham students - on Saturday. Footage of the event was posted on Snapchat, but no arrests were made as the crowd dispersed as police arrived. The university said there was ""no excuse"" for breaching guidelines. The party in Radford was one of several broken up by police across Nottingham and Nottinghamshire over the weekend. The city and county are due to enter tier three restrictions, the highest Covid alert level, once the national lockdown ends on Wednesday. A University of Nottingham spokeswoman said: ""The overwhelming majority of students are following the rules and there are now just 16 cases of Covid-19 reported in a student population of 35,000. ""However, there is no excuse, we have been abundantly clear that where a minority breach Covid restrictions we will act. ""In addition to the fixed penalties issued by police, the university will take disciplinary action. ""In the most serious cases, students will be fast-tracked to the highest levels of our process where suspension and exclusion are potential outcomes."" The university confirmed figures obtained by The Guardian, which said 91 of its students had been fined a total of £58,865 with 672 disciplined. A number of students in the city have been penalised by police, including four Nottingham Trent University students who were suspended and fined £10,000 each. Nottinghamshire's Chief Constable Craig Guildford has previously called for some students to be expelled ""as a deterrent"". In response to the latest events, he said: ""Whilst such gatherings of young people may seem far removed from the well-being of mostly older people, they do hugely increase the risk posed to those people by spreading the infection far and wide.

"Asked whether the motion would be the ""full package"", Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said discussion was ""ongoing"". There is speculation that MPs might be asked to vote on the withdrawal agreement but not the further ""political declaration"". Labour said that would lead to the ""blindest of blind Brexits"". The PM's deal includes a withdrawal agreement - setting out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and the backstop arrangements - and a political declaration on the way the future EU-UK relationship will work. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said both European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had stressed that the withdrawal agreement and political declaration were part of the same ""negotiated package"". He said to separate them ""would mean leaving the EU with absolutely no idea where we are heading ... we wouldn't vote for that"". Previous ""meaningful votes"" on the deal involved both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration but Speaker John Bercow has said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs had already rejected by historic margins twice. Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button The BBC's Vicki Young said separating the two might get around the Speaker's ruling but, after Sir Keir's intervention, looked unlikely to get more votes on board. Last week the European Council agreed to postpone Brexit beyond the expected date of 29 March - offering an extension until 22 May, if MPs approved the deal negotiated with the EU by the end of this week. If not, it offered a shorter delay until 12 April, allowing the UK time to get the deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the official conclusions from last week's summit only mention the withdrawal agreement, not the political declaration. Announcing the government's intention to table a motion for debate on Friday, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said there would be a motion put forward later ""relating to the UK's withdrawal from the EU."" ""The motion tabled will comply with the Speaker's ruling but the only way we ensure we leave in good time on May 22 is by approving the Withdrawal Agreement by 11pm on March 29, which is tomorrow. ""The European Council has agreed to an extension until May 22 provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons this week. ""It's crucial we make every effort to give effect to that and to allow the House to debate this important issue."" Her Labour shadow Valerie Vaz asked for ""further clarity... on whether this is in fact the meaningful vote three?"" Mrs Leadsom said the motion would be tabled ""as soon as possible"" and discussions were ""ongoing"". What happened last night? On Wednesday, the Commons failed to find a majority for a way forward after voting for eight different options to take Brexit forward - including leaving without a deal, creating a customs union and backing a confirmatory referendum on any deal. Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who oversaw the process of ""indicative votes"", said the lack of a majority for any proposition was ""disappointing"". But he told the Today programme no ""assumptions"" should be made about the outcome of further indicative votes, which he believes should take place on Monday, if the PM's deal is not approved this week. The EU Commission's chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said the bloc fully respected the process, but added: ""We counted eight nos last night, now we need a yes on the way forward.""

She would resign as party leader after 22 May if her deal was passed, but stay on as PM until a new leader is elected. However, Downing Street said it would be a ""different ball game"" if the deal was not passed. But although the prime minister has won over the likes of former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a number of Brexiteers are still refusing to vote for the deal. Mrs May needs to win over 75 rebels to overturn the 149-vote rejection of her deal on 13 March. Many, including prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, will not side with her unless she gets the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - whose leader said on Wednesday they could not vote for the deal. The DUP's main objection is to the backstop, the ""insurance policy"" designed to avoid the return of border checkpoints between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event a future trade deal is not agreed. There are also signs Theresa May's offer to resign has hardened Labour opposition as they fear what the next Tory leader will push for. Labour MP Liz Kendall said: ""I am extremely worried about our future relationship with the EU, and whatever is agreed in Parliament on the withdrawal agreement, the next Tory leader - if they're a hardline Brexiteer - will push for a hard Brexit.

"Officers said a customer was found having a drink while waiting for a takeaway at Indian Nights in East Bridgford, Nottinghamshire. Three people were also found sitting drinking alcohol at The Wheatsheaf, a pub in Cropwell Bishop. These customers were each given £200 fixed penalty notices. Both businesses have been served with legal notices to ensure people do not consume food or drink on the premises, but are still allowed to serve takeaway customers or do deliveries in line with national guidance. Simon Robinson, leader of Rushcliffe Borough Council, described the breaches of lockdown restrictions as ""shocking"". ""In undermining the current lockdown, these venues have demonstrated complete disregard for their customers, staff and local communities at a crucial time in our fight against Covid-19,"" he said. The legal notices - known as prohibition notices - last for as long as the current lockdown restrictions are in place. The customers were all discovered on Wednesday evening, when Nottinghamshire Police officers visited the pub and council officers visited the restaurant. Council officers found more than a dozen empty beer and wine bottles at the restaurant, leading them to believe other takeaway customers had previously been served with alcohol. Police were also called to a house in Swale Grove in Bingham on Thursday night, where they found four men from different households and fined them all £200 each.

"More than 30 protesters from Abermule staged a picket at County Hall as Powys County Council discussed the scheme. A move to roll the money over to the new financial year starting in April was dropped in the face of opposition. A fresh attempt to earmark the cash will stress it can be used for other locations suggested by campaigners. The facility will handle domestic recycling of items such as glass, cans and food waste. But residents fear an increase in traffic and noise will spoil the area, and the scheme won planning approval in August by just one vote. Campaigners from Abermule Communities Together (ACT) had been promised by council leaders at a public meeting in December they would have an opportunity to suggest a different site. But when council leaders tried on Thursday to move the money for the project to the next financial year - a move known as a virement - backbench councillors challenged the wording. Gareth Pugh, a Conservative member whose ward includes Abermule, asked if the rollover was for highways and recycling generally or specifically for a waste centre at Abermule. He said if it was for the service ""then I could support it - if it's for Abermule, then I can't"". Liberal Democrat Gareth Ratcliffe added that people were ""distressed at the way this is being handled"" after promises had been made to consider other sites. Cabinet member Phyl Davies agreed to postpone the motion and redraft it for the next full council meeting ""seeing as there is so much confusion"". A spokesman for ACT said campaigners hoped the new motion would be ""titled correctly, to make sure the money is portable and can be used at one of the other locations we have identified"".",Villagers hope to thwart council plans to build a waste recycling centre in their community after a move to earmark £2.7m for the project was withdrawn.
"Patients at the Queen Alexandra Hospital were found waiting in corridors or in ambulances outside A&E, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. The watchdog noted improvements in 2017, but said issues were continuing which it would continue to monitor. The hospital said the report was a ""fair and honest reflection of where we are after one year"". The CQC has kept the unit's rating as ""requires improvement"". The watchdog said: ""Inspectors found that some patients were waiting too long for treatment. ""There were instances of poor patient flow throughout the department meant which patients were still waiting in corridors or ambulances outside the emergency department because of the congestion."" The inspection in April and May noted however, that some parts of the hospital were well led and found the care of children and young people to be outstanding. Mark Cubbon, chief executive of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""We entirely accept the findings. ""None of us want a situation where any of our services are considered inadequate, and our focus must now be on addressing the outstanding areas of concern and continuing to build on the steady progress already made."" The CQC said it would continue to monitor the trust closely.","A hospital emergency department is still leaving patients waiting too long for treatment, inspectors found."
"By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent Laura Tenison, the founder of Newport-based JoJo Maman Bebe, wants other retailers to join her. She has linked up with charity Barnardos and green group Hubbub. The idea behind A Mother To Another is that parents donate hand-me-downs which are then put together as complete outfits. Barnados then donates them to parents in need. Launched on Tuesday, parents can hand in clothes in good condition to any of JoJo Maman Bebe's 66 stores across the UK. They are then put together and gift wrapped for children from vulnerable families. The idea is similar to some schemes donating toys at Christmas. Ms Tenison, originally from Pontypool, hopes in the six weeks before Mother's Day the initiative will gain momentum. ""It's about thinking of your children's favourite garments and how they could make a difference to some else,"" she said. ""We want good quality items you don't want to put in a black bin bag and if you haven't a friend to give to, perhaps give them to someone who is in a vulnerable situation, in need."" Ms Tenison said re-using clothes was also good for the environment and never worries about seeing her own firm's clothes re-sold on eBay. Across the UK an estimated 1 million tonnes of textiles are thrown away every year according to the environmental charity Wrap. That amounts to one third of UK clothing ending up in landfill, and therefore losing all its value. Research for Marks and Spencer found 56% of parents throw baby clothes away with the rubbish.",A businesswoman has launched a campaign to keep children's clothes out of landfill sites and given to deprived families instead.

"Linda YuehChief business correspondent If you're confused by the various figures that are being thrown around, you're not the only one. And once you throw in revisions to data, it's hard to even know whether we were in a double-dip recession. What is clear is that the overall picture is that of a stagnant economy where even a small change can make all the difference. So, this is what happened. A recession as defined by economists is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. A ""double-dip"" recession is when there is a second set of two consecutive quarters of negative growth before the economy recovers to where it was before the recession. The Office for National Statistics revised up the GDP estimate for the first quarter of 2012 to ""flat"" from negative, so they say that there were now not two consecutive negative quarters of GDP. So, no double-dip recession. Well, that's not entirely the case if you really want to split hairs. Output fell by £26m in the first quarter of 2012 from the end of 2011. So, GDP for that quarter was £376.436bn, a fall of £26m from £376.462bn. Technically, it's a fall of -0.0069%. But, if you round it to one decimal place, which is normal practice for this type of official statistic, then output is flat. So, £26m or -0.0017% of UK output is the difference between a normal and a double-dip recession. For those of you thinking that if only one of those ultra-expensive multi-million houses had been sold in the first quarter of 2012, then this wouldn't even be under discussion, you'd be right. And, if this is all a bit technical, that's absolutely right. Clearly, the more important point and the most worrying is that the recession is deeper than before and we are deeper in the hole than before. The UK economy has lost 7.2% of output from peak-to-trough in this recession versus the prior estimate of just under 7%. And, we have yet to recover 3.9% of that output versus the prior estimate of 2.6%. ONS revisions allow for 0.2 percentage points of estimation error. That means that their estimates move around by 0.2%. This means that it may not be the end of the debate over if the UK has double dipped or not. With a zigzag pattern of alternating positive and negative quarters of GDP, it's not surprising if we continue to ""dip"" in and out of negative territory.","Twenty six million pounds is the difference between a ""double-dip"" recession and a normal one."
"Lance Martin, 24, died after being stabbed in the back four times in Derby in the early hours of 28 February. Clara Butler, 22, her 24-year-old sister Francesca Butler, and her sister's boyfriend Kieran Bareham, 31, have denied murder at Derby Crown Court. Her father Jamie Butler, 43, denied manslaughter. The jury was told father-of-one Mr Martin was ""clearly drunk"" when he encountered Clara Butler in Portland Street, Normanton, just after midnight. A row broke out between the pair before Mr Martin continued on his way. The prosecution said the sisters and Mr Bareham followed Mr Martin after arming themselves with kitchen knives. They confronted him on a nearby road and were later joined by their father, who arrived unarmed on a bike. A fight broke out between Mr Butler and Mr Martin, during which the prosecution alleges Clara Butler repeatedly stabbed Mr Martin in the back. The knife penetrated his lung and spleen and he died in hospital. 'Outnumbered' Mr Martin's blood was found on Clara Butler's clothes and her DNA was found on the knife used to kill him, recovered from a nearby wheelie bin, the jury heard. The prosecution said the involvement of her three co-defendants also made them jointly responsible for Mr Martin's killing. Prosecutor Mary Loram QC said: ""We are not going to pretend the behaviour that night was perfect - far from it. ""He [Mr Martin] was aggressive towards Clara Butler in particular, he had clearly been drinking and he used physical violence himself. ""But none of that justifies what happened to him.

"The Labour leader appeared surprised when the ex-Hear'Say star rounded on him in a debate on ITV's The Agenda. Mr Miliband said the plan was a principled way of raising extra cash for the NHS. But Ms Klass claimed it would hit old people living in modest homes in London rather than the super-rich. ""For me, what is so disturbing is the name in its own right - mansion,"" she said. ""Immediately you conjure up in your head these Barbie-esque houses... but in London, which is where 80% of the people who are going to be paying this tax actually live - the South East of England - have you seen what that amount of money can get you? Often it's like a garage. ""When you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time. ""The people who are the super-super-rich who are buying their houses for £140m, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they've got their tax rebates and their amazing accountants. ""It's going to be the little grannies that have lived in those houses for years and years."" 'Bring on the debate' Mr Miliband replied that he understood ""that people don't like paying more in tax"", but he said the plan would raise £1.2bn: ""The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government. ""I say bring on this debate about how we're going to change our country."" Ms Klass replied: ""Is that your only option? You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can't just point at things and tax them. ""You need to have a better strategy and say, 'Why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?'"" Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to the US and a pensioner, also weighed into the row, telling Mr Miliband: ""You're going to screw me royally."" Last month, shadow chancellor Ed Balls argued that Labour's proposed ""mansion tax"" would cost £250 a month for those people with homes worth between £2m and £3m. Concern He said owners of homes worth ""tens of millions"" and second-home owners would pay much higher rates of the ""progressive"" tax, and that the threshold would rise in line with average prices for high-value properties, not inflation. Mr Balls said ""asset-rich, cash poor"" homeowners who do not earn enough to pay income tax at 40% would be able to defer payment of the mansion tax until ""the property changes hands"". But several Labour MPs in London have expressed concerns about the policy. It is one of Labour's main 2015 manifesto commitments, with the proceeds due to be used to fund the recruitment of 38,000 new GPs, nurses, midwives and other NHS professionals. Some Labour candidates for Mayor of London in 2016 have sought reassurances from the party leadership amid concerns that the steep rise in houses prices in London in recent years will see family homes become liable for the tax. In particular, they have called for safeguards for people on low or middle incomes who bought properties decades ago and have seen their market value rocket.","Ed Miliband has defended plans for a ""mansion tax"" on homes worth more than £2m after singer Myleene Klass said it would hit ""little grannies""."

"From 3 April, homosexuals could face being whipped or stoned in the tiny South East Asian state. In 2014, Brunei became the first East Asian country to adopt Islamic Sharia law despite widespread condemnation. Mr Clooney said the new laws amounted to ""human rights violations"". ""In the onslaught of news where we see the world backsliding into authoritarianism this stands alone,"" the actor wrote in a column for the entertainment website Deadline. ""Brunei is a Monarchy and certainly any boycott would have little effect on changing these laws"", he said. ""But are we really going to help pay for these human rights violations?"" He said Dorchester Collection hotels in the US, UK, France and Italy, which are owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, should be avoided by those who oppose the measures. Brunei, on the island of Borneo, is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and has grown rich on oil and gas exports. The Sultan owns the Brunei Investment Agency, which counts some of the world's top hotels in its portfolio, including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. ""I've stayed at many of them,"" Mr Clooney wrote, ""because I hadn't done my homework and didn't know who owned them. ""Every single time we stay at or take meetings at or dine at any of these nine hotels we are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens,"" he added. Other public figures have also announced they are boycotting the Dorchester Collection. Filmmaker Dustin Lance Black wrote on Twitter: ""If you continue to stay at or frequent the Beverley Hills Hotel, you are guilty of financially supporting these murderers."" BBC world affairs editor John Simpson also confirmed that he wouldn't be visiting hotels owned by the group. In 2014, Ellen DeGeneres and Stephen Fry vowed to boycott the group over Brunei's anti-gay laws. Brunei's ruling royals possess a huge private fortune and its largely ethnic-Malay population enjoy generous state handouts and pay no taxes. The Sultan introduced a tough Islamic penal code nearly five years ago which it said would be introduced over a period of several years. Under the new laws, theft will be punished by the amputation of a hand for a first offence and the amputation of a foot for a second offence. When he announced the move, the Sultan, 72, one of the world's wealthiest men, called the code ""a part of the great history of our nation"".","Hollywood actor George Clooney is calling for a boycott of nine luxury hotels with links to Brunei, after the country said gay sex and adultery would soon be punishable by death."

"Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash outside RAF Croughton following which the suspect - Anne Sacoolas - fled the UK. His relatives and local MP Andrea Leadsom wanted to discuss a series of road incidents said to involve US staff from the air base. But the United States said a meeting would be inappropriate because the family intends to sue its government. In a letter addressed to Ms Leadsom, Yael Lempert, deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in London, said: ""Regrettably, at this time we are unable to meet with the Dunn family directly or discuss specifics of the case surrounding their son's tragic death. ""The family's spokesperson has publicly announced the family's intention to make an imminent filing of a lawsuit against the United States Government. ""Given the strong interest of both countries to ensure proper judicial review, we have been advised that it would not be appropriate to engage in a discussion which might touch on that matter."" However, Ms Lempert said she would welcome the chance to meet Ms Leadsom and Col Bridget McNamara, RAF Croughton's base commander, to ""discuss the steps that have already been taken"" to improve driver safety.

"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News The risk of ""sudden cardiac death"" peaks in the morning and rises again in the evening. A study published in the journal Nature suggests that levels of a protein which controls the heart's rhythm fluctuate through the day. A body clock expert said the study was ""beautiful"". The inner workings of the body go through a daily routine known as a circadian rhythm, which keeps the body in sync with its surroundings. Jet lag is the result of the body getting out of sync. As the chemistry of the body changes throughout the day, this can impact on health. US researchers say they have identified, in mice, how the time can affect the risk of sudden cardiac death, which kills 100,000 people a year in the UK. 'Insights' They identified a protein called kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15), which was controlled by the body clock and whose levels in the body went up and down during the day. The protein influences ion channels which control heart beat. Genetically modified mice which produced too much Klf15 and those which produced none at all both had an increased risk of developing deadly disturbances in cardiac rhythm. Prof Darwin Jeyaraj, from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, said: ""Our study identifies a hitherto unknown mechanism for electrical instability in the heart. ""It provides insights into day and night variation in arrhythmia susceptibility that has been known for many years."" There are important differences in the way that human and mouse hearts work, so it is unknown whether the same mechanism exists in people. Fellow researcher Prof Mukesh Jain said: ""We are just scratching the surface. It might be that, with further study, assessment of circadian disruption in patients with cardiovascular disease might lead us to innovative approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment."" Dr Michael Hastings, from the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, told the BBC: ""It's a great paper, it gives a beautiful molecular mechanism which explains a phenomenon that's been kicking around for a long time."" He said translating the findings into medicine was all about ""targeting the most vulnerable stage"" such as slow-release blood pressure drugs, which become active first thing in the morning when the risk is highest. ""When you think about it, it's so blooming obvious,"" he added.",How the time of day can increase the risk of dying from an irregular heartbeat has been identified by researchers.
"The stone, which was originally laid on 9 November 1963, sits in Cwmdonkin Park in Swansea - close to where Thomas grew up in Uplands. Although a pilgrimage site to fans, the stone became damaged due to moss and erosion which obscured the inscription. About 30 people gathered in the park for the unveiling. Among those attending was Glenys Cour, the wife of late sculptor Ronald Cour, who went to school with Thomas and cut and inscribed the original stone in 1963 to mark 10 years since the poet died of pneumonia. ""With his worldwide fame, that his birthplace should allow this to happen, it's quite incredible,"" Ms Cour said. ""The wonderful people who've undertaken this, I'm so so grateful."" The restoration work was paid for by the Dylan Thomas Society and the Heritage Lottery, along with volunteer support from the Dylan Thomas Birth Place and the Friends of Cwmdonkin Park. Society volunteer Geoff Haden said much of Dylan Thomas's inspiration as a writer came from the park. ""If you look back at his poetry, an awful lot has the influence of the park about it,"" he said. ""This is all part of bringing Dylan back to the Uplands where Dylan was born, where he worked for 23 years, where we wrote two thirds of his published work. This park was his world within a world.""

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Nearly 700 people have been asked to join the Academy after a race row. ""It's always amazing to me that it's taken this long for all of us to realise we should all be represented in film and television,"" she said. ""There's a planet full of people that aren't white heterosexual. There's a lot of people of colour, fat people, people that aren't absolutely perfect. ""Hollywood's always always celebrated beauty and perfection and that's great, who doesn't want to look at beauty and perfection? But we also need to represent everybody on the planet,"" said the actress and presenter, who voices the lead character in Pixar animation Finding Dory. DeGeneres - who married her partner Portia Di Rossi in 2008 in California after same-sex marriage became legal there - has previously hosted the Oscars twice. A selfie she took while presenting the 2014 ceremony became the most retweeted photo of all time. DeGeneres, who is gearing up for the UK release of Finding Dory, joked about the selfie, saying: ""Nothing will beat it, ever. Maybe I'll aspire to beat it myself."" Finding Dory - the sequel to Finding Nemo - has been a huge success in the US, where it has become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. But its success is unlikely to translate into significant Oscars glory - the best picture award has never been won by an animated film, something DeGeneres says she thinks is a shame. ""You obviously relate more when you see a person and a face, and maybe that's what the Academy Awards have been about,"" the 58-year-old said. ""But the performances in animated movies are challenging for us [voice actors] because we're getting emotions across strictly through our voices. ""We need to get comedic timing, sadness, emotion, all through our voice without the benefit of body language or facial expressions. So it's as much of a challenge, if not a tiny bit more."" If there was one phrase that stuck in the mind from 2003's Finding Nemo, it was Dory's motto ""just keep swimming"" - in other words, stay strong in the face of uncertainty. With the sequel finally about to arrive in UK cinemas 13 years later - what message will a whole new generation of children take from the second instalment of the franchise? ""Just keep swimming is always a good motto no matter what, but this time around the most important one for me is that your disability, your supposed disability, is your strength,"" DeGeneres said. The disability she refers to is Dory's short term memory loss, which causes her to instantly forget names and faces. In Finding Dory, however, the blue tang fish begins to get flashbacks of her parents, whom she lost when she was young, which leads to her quest to find them. ""You should look at whatever makes you different as what makes you special,"" DeGeneres said of Dory's memory loss. ""We need to embrace who we are. So I think that's a good message. People ask 'what would Dory do?' and it's because of her disability that people ask that, because she doesn't worry about the past, think about the future or analyse everything. ""She's just in the present moment, which is something we should aspire to."" During DeGeneres's UK visit, the political landscape changed dramatically as Theresa May became prime minister - the second woman in the UK to do so - something DeGeneres says sends out a positive message. The comedian and talk show host has campaigned for the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the US ahead of the November presidential election. ""There should be representatives for everybody, so, of course, it's a great thing for young girls to look at, and also for young boys so they respect women more,"" she said. ""And I think what a woman brings to the job is a sensibility of growing up as a woman, knowing the things we have to fight against, which is stereotypes or double standards or whatever - so if a woman is in office she's probably going to fight more for women's rights because she understands more. ""So there's something to be said for that gender being in office rather than a man, but it's really about the person that's most qualified for the job, I think."" After her London visit, DeGeneres returned to the US to continue hosting her massively popular talk show Ellen, which attracts not only a high number of viewers, but also a strong online following. Clips from the show are uploaded to its official Facebook page, and an official platform - Ellentube - has even been set up primarily to host material from the programme. ""That's how a lot of people are watching my show. A lot of people that don't own a TV will watch a clip or something,"" DeGeneres said. ""That's why we created Ellentube, and we're working so hard on our digital network because we know that is the future and that's where people are going to watch everything."" With her TV show still going strong, it may be a while before DeGeneres returns to the big screen. But when she does, there's another of her films which she joked could be in line for a second instalment.

"The route was due to open in December 2018 but has faced numerous delays. A committee has urged Transport for London (TfL) to keep a ""tight grasp"" on the project's leadership and budget, which is now £18.6bn after a £825m boost of government cash in December. TfL said there had been ""many challenges"", but the line would be opened ""as soon as possible"". Known as the Elizabeth Line, the route, running from Reading to Essex through central London, has suffered from delays, budget complexities and issues with its construction work and signalling systems over the decade. Management of the scheme was transferred from Crossrail Ltd to TfL, chaired by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, in October 2020. A cross-party London Assembly Transport Committee warned TfL and the mayor to ensure ""past mistakes are not repeated"". It also said there may not be ""enough resources or the right level of expertise"" to complete its final phases with safety assurance activities and technical processes. The inquiry noted the coronavirus pandemic had ""exacerbated resource constraints"" and created ""possible staff burnout"". Chairwoman of the Transport Committee, Alison Moore, said it was ""vital"" TfL and the mayor ""adopt a Sherlock-style forensic focus"" to deliver the project on time and on budget. She insisted Londoners ""need assurance"" that ""they will be no further out of pocket"". ""Covid-19 has understandably put increased financial and staff pressures on Crossrail opening the Elizabeth Line,"" she said. ""However there are aspects to delivering Crossrail, such as supporting employees' workloads and better forecasting project delays, that can contribute to delivering as promised."" She added it was ""imperative"" the line was ""up and running as soon as possible"". London's transport commissioner Andy Byford said his focus ""remains on safely opening the Elizabeth line as soon as possible"". ""There have been many challenges with delivering the railway and I am confident lessons are being learned and applied in these complex final stages of delivery.

"Two of Cunard's three ships began to sail back to Southampton earlier this month when it halted its international holiday voyages. In a statement, president Simon Palethorpe said it was ""prudent"" to extend the suspension until 15 May. Fellow Carnival company P&O Cruises said the maiden voyage of its new ship, Iona, might be delayed. Passengers from its three ships were flown home when it announced it was ending cruises on 11 March. Cunard's Queen Victoria arrived back in Southampton from Florida last week and Queen Mary 2 is returning from Australia with passengers who were unable to fly due to medical conditions. Mr Palethorpe said the pandemic was ""without doubt, the most challenging period the travel industry has ever seen"". ""It's clear the pace of developments around Covid-19 has increased significantly. We will continue to monitor government guidelines and restrictions and this may mean there are further changes to the timing when each of our ships return to service."" P&O president Paul Ludlow said it was ""not feasible"" to return to sailing after its initial 30-day pause. He also said there could be a delay to the arrival of P&O's new ship Iona, which is due to be named in Southampton this summer because restrictions had forced the slowdown of work at the Mayer Werft shipyard in Germany. Other lines which use Southampton - Princess Cruises, Saga and Fred Olsen - also cancelled voyages when the government advised against cruise ship travel for people aged over 70, and those with pre-existing health conditions.",Cruise companies Cunard and P&O have lengthened the suspension of operations due to the coronavirus pandemic.
"A new report from AMs blames a lack of leadership in councils and the Welsh Government for the lack of progress that followed the Active Travel Act becoming law in 2013. Figures also show fewer children are going to school on foot or by bike. The Welsh Government said it would consider the report. The report from the assembly economy, infrastructure and skills committee said that latest figures from the Welsh Government demonstrated that rates of walking and cycling were ""static"". During 2013, 6% of people aged over 16 made at least one so-called active travel trip by bicycle - to get to a destination as a means of transport rather than for pleasure - at least once a week. The figure for 2016-17 - the most recent figures - showed it stood at 5%. In 2013-14, 46% walked for ""active travel"" at least five minutes several times a week - by 2016-17 the figure increased to 47%. But while in 2013-14, 53% of children walked to primary school and 2% cycled, by 2016-17 it had reduced to 42% walking and 1% going by bike. The figures were more steady for children walking to secondary school because, in 2013-14, 33% of children walked to secondary school and 1% cycled, while 34% walked and 1% cycled by 2016-17. The act placed obligations on councils to provide network maps - showing existing routes and future plans - and to continually improve routes for walking and cycling. But the committee said that producing maps of routes proved to be time consuming, and that the underfunding of the process likely diverted resources from infrastructure. Significantly more funding was needed, the report said. Although it welcomed £60m from the Welsh Government over three years - around £10 per head a year - it fell short of the committee's own recommendation of £17-20 per head annually. Strategic leadership has been lacking, the AMs reported, adding that the ambition of the act cannot be realised through the actions of a ""few dedicated"" cycling and transport officers. ""The Active Travel Act sought to transform the way people in Wales travel over short distances by facilitating better ways of cycling and walking over using the car,"" said committee chairman Russell George. ""However, static and falling numbers of people cycling and walking in Wales shows that limited progress has been made."" Mr George said the committee had called on the Welsh Government ""to learn lessons on progress to date, provide better leadership and much higher levels of funding to ensure that the original ambitions of the act are realised"". A Welsh Local Government Association spokesman said: ""Local authorities have been very supportive of the Active Travel Act and its objectives but have always been concerned about raising expectations in the absence of any significant additional resources. ""It would be misleading the public to publish ambitious maps that, whilst they may flow with the spirit of the act, are not deliverable anywhere in the near future. ""Local authorities have taken a realistic approach, mindful of resources and against a background of shrinking budgets for highways and transport."" The Welsh Government spokesman said it would respond in due course to the report. ""Our Active Travel Act is the first of its kind in the world and we are proud of what has been achieved in such a short time with our strategic partners,"" a spokesman said. ""At our fifth annual Active Travel Conference last week, Economy and Transport Secretary Ken Skates urged local authorities to refine, improve and realise their plans for walking and cycling networks. ""We are accelerating delivery and over the next three years expect to earmark over £90m on active travel infrastructure improvements and projects across Wales.""",The numbers of people walking and cycling to work has not increased in the five years since a law aimed at encouraging the practice was passed.
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the ""internet-of-things"". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. ""We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,"" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. ""Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West."" 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was ""arguably the toughest and most rigorous"" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering"" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. ""Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. ""The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection."" 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a ""cell"" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen ""a credible plan"". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. ""Resilience is key,"" Mr Martin said in Brussels. ""There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market."" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.","In the shiny, optimistic vision of the future we will all be living in ""smart cities"" in which self-driving cars will check the best routes after being charged up on intelligent, connected power grids."
"Although some children have continued to go to childcare ""hubs"" at schools, most have spent lockdown at home and parents have had to juggle home-schooling with their own employment. Now that many pupils are now officially on their summer break, parents have been telling us how home-schooling worked for them - and how they feel about the prospect of their children returning full-time in August. 'It's been a challenge' - Derek Miller, Aberdeenshire For Derek Miller's family, home learning has been a challenge. He has been trying to juggle working from home while his two sons, who are 13 and 15, get on with school work. They have struggled with a poor internet connection at their rural Aberdeenshire home. But he says this is only part of the difficulty - while his sons' school is trying its best, the absence of traditional classroom teaching has made things tough. ""We are relying heavily on them self-disciplining and supervising themselves"", he added. He said that not always having access to a teacher to clarify simple queries has presented problems. How available teachers are to pupils has been mixed. He suspects some teachers have struggled with working from home. ""When they get stuck then sometimes I can help with things if I remember it from school - a lot of the time I can't help because I don't have time. It is a bit of a farce really"", he said. Derek said that the news children might be able to go back to school full-time after summer was a welcome relief. 'A disaster' - Carole Lyons, East Renfrewshire Carole Lyons says home schooling has been ""a disaster"". She has one daughter, and Carole says she can't imagine how difficult it must be for families with more children. There has been the odd taught class, and a few lecture-style videos. Most lessons have been more like home work rather than teaching. Her daughter, who is finishing first year at high school, has been given reading and research to do, with very limited teaching taking place. Carole was concerned and asked the school how to help, and was ""basically told to back off"". She says she doesn't fault the teachers, because they are trying their best, but had been concerned that blended learning would be an ""absolute shambles"" in August. She had been concerned about the prospect of blended learning after the summer, but is not too worried about her daughter catching up on what she has missed if schools return full-time in August. Virtual piano lessons - Mark Cummings, East Dunbartonshire Mark Cummings' daughters attend a fee-paying school, and he is very pleased with how quickly it adapted to the circumstances. His youngest daughter is in nursery and has had video calls with her teacher and classmates every week. His eldest daughter is finishing primary one. Twice a day she has virtual lessons with her teacher, with other work set to be completed independently. She has even been able to keep up with her piano lessons - virtually, of course. Learning life skills - Sandy Rennie, Inverness While dad Sandy Rennie has ""really enjoyed"" spending so much time with his children, it has also been very challenging. Teachers issue work in the morning, and then the children are left to their own devices. But, Sandy says, it can't be easy for teachers either. ""I don't envy the teachers. there's more appreciation for teachers when you're home schooling."" One saving grace, he says, is that his children have been given laptops by the school. The Rennies often manage to conclude their assignments by lunchtime, so mum and dad have been using the afternoons to teach them life skills - like cooking, cleaning and gardening. Star Wars and sunflowers - Heather, Fife Heather and her sons have taken a hands on approach to home learning. One of the examples they have enjoyed was growing sunflowers. They planted them back in March and she has since incorporated them into lessons about maths, writing and biology. Another highlight was Star Wars Day, where the boys thought they had a ""day off"" but actually did science experiments and cooking. Heather says their teachers have been excellent, but despite this the enthusiasm from her sons has dropped off. As time goes on, they are missing their classmates more.",It's 14 weeks since schools across Scotland were closed as part of a plan to help limit the spread of coronavirus.
"Keziah Flux-Edmonds was discovered lying next to the bodies of her father, Darren Flux-Edmonds, 44, and two dogs in East Cowes on Wednesday. She was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Newport but died a short time later. More than 200 neighbours, family and school friends gathered at the home in Cromwell Avenue, on Thursday evening. As flowers, toys and candles were laid outside the house, Keziah's favourite song ""Roar"" by Katy Perry was played. Pupils and teachers at Keziah's school, Queensgate Foundation Primary, will be offered support after the half term holiday. Family friend, Lucie McMahon said: ""How do you explain it to five and six-year-olds? The best way you can explain it is that she's gone to the stars."" Hampshire Constabulary said Keziah's mother was being supported by specialist officers. Isle of Wight councillor Julia Baker-Smith, who lives nearby, said: ""We're absolutely shocked and saddened.

"A spokesman for Manx National Heritage (MNH) said an issue with a timber rod was discovered during a routine maintenance check on Friday. The 72ft (22m) diameter wheel is the largest working waterwheel of its kind in the world. It is unclear at this stage how long the repairs will take or what the cost will be. Known as the Lady Isabella, the wheel was built in 1854 to pump water out of the Laxey lead and zinc mines. Brandon Ellis, Properties Manager for MNH, said engineers had identified a structural issue with a large timber rod which connects to the main crank. ""This has necessitated stopping the wheel to allow further detailed assessment of the damage by structural engineers."" The Victorian structure has been run as a heritage attraction since 1989 and offers visitors panoramic views across the Laxey Valley. A £250,000 maintenance project including painting, cleaning and masonry and timber repairs was completed in 2015. The site remains open to the public.",The Great Laxey Wheel on the Isle of Man has been stopped from turning after engineers found a structural problem.
"Last month Honda confirmed it would close the car plant in 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Unite union said the ""decision couldn't come at a worse time"" and it would ""fight to keep Honda in Swindon"". A Honda spokesman said it ""recognised this is an unsettling time for our associates and the local community"". The Japanese company builds 160,000 Honda Civics a year in Swindon - its only car factory in the EU. Patrick Renard, who works at Honda Logistics in Ghent in Belgium and is chairman of the European Workers Council Honda, travelled from Switzerland to support the workers. He said: ""I do strongly believe there is a future for this plant in the global Honda world - so the Swindon factory has to stay open. ""It is the backbone of Honda in Europe for the last 30 years, so we are pretty sure there will be a domino effect on the rest of Europe. There are production plants in Italy, Spain and France, and we believe this is the first step of Honda leaving Europe as an organisation. ""So it's not only for the Swindon people, it's also for the European people on the continent that I'm here."" Steve Preddy, from Unite, said: ""Swindon has had a troubling downturn in its fortunes so this threat of closure couldn't come at a worse time. Too many decent jobs have been lost and not replaced. That hurts a community, as you can see it in the high street. ""It would be a tragedy if Honda walks away from a town that has given that company so much, sending a loyal workforce to the dole queue. We can't and won't let that happen."" Business Secretary Greg Clark said he would continue to try to persuade Honda to reverse its decision. He said: ""I will continue to work jointly with associates, the trade unions, suppliers, Swindon Council, local MPs and the whole local community to make a joint case that is compelling and shows with evidence that this decision should be reversed."" A Honda spokesman said: ""We are consulting on this proposal with our associates and their representatives. It is not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this consultation or comment on its activities. ""There is no time limit on how long consultation will last, however we anticipate that this will be longer than the minimum 45 days required by law.""",Hundreds of workers from Swindon's Honda factory have taken part in a protest through the town urging the company not to close the plant.
"A convoy of trucks escorted by police carried the remains from the airport to the presidential palace in Lima. Yale agreed to return the artefacts last year after a long campaign by Peru. President Alan Garcia led the welcoming ceremony. ""They are treasures, even though they are not made of gold or precious stones, because they represent the dignity and pride of Peru,"" Mr Garcia said before there was a gun salute for the artefacts. Centenary The relics will be briefly displayed in Lima before being taken to Cuzco - the historical capital of the Inca empire - where they will housed in a new cultural centre. The return comes just in time for the centenary of the ""discovery"" of Machu Picchu by the American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1912. Peru waged a long diplomatic and legal campaign to recover the artefacts, which it said had only been loaned to Yale. In all some 45,000 archaeological pieces are to be returned. The ""Lost City"" of Machu Picchu in the Andes is Peru's main tourist attraction. It is the most famous monument of the Inca empire, which ruled until the 15th Century Spanish conquest.","Peru has given a lavish welcome to hundreds of Inca artefacts returned by Yale University in the US, nearly a century after they were taken from the famed citadel of Machu Picchu."
"By Dhruti ShahBBC News The 28-year-old, who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, was diagnosed about a decade ago with ADHD and now hopes her comics will help others to understand the challenges for those with the condition. She told the BBC: ""I'd just started a new job working in data visualisation, and it was the first time I was able to be really open about having ADHD and talk to my colleagues about what it's like. ""We were telling stories and joking about how I always get off track while I'm telling stories, and I said that it's very much like having a sleepy train conductor running my train of thought. I had the idea for a flowchart, I posted it on Twitter and it took off immediately."" Her graphic shows that when she hears non-ADHD storytelling, it involves a straight move from the start of a story to the end. Her storytelling, however, involves a pre-story prologue before moving to the start of the story, and then wandering through 'too many details', a side-story and losing her train of thought before reaching the end of the tale - and then apologising. However, as with all things that hit the internet - once it's let loose, be careful of memes and amendments. Dani's diagram was re-versioned by an unknown person who split the flowcharts and created a meme with 'How a normal person tells a story' taking the place of the 'Non-ADHD Storytelling' heading Dani had given her first flowchart, and 'How I tell a story' replacing the 'ADHD Storytelling' heading for the meandering flowchart. The experience hit a chord and became a viral hit. Actress and writer Mindy Kaling even posted the meme stating ""I feel attacked"". Dani says she was a little bit disheartened when the storytelling version with the ADHD element stripped out exploded in the social sphere, as her watermark had been stripped off and the fonts had changed. ""When you're a graphic designer, it just hurts your heart - at least use a good font. ""I had also made a deliberate choice not to water down my images to try to appeal to lots of people, because I wanted people with ADHD to be heard."" She said as the image resonated so much, she decided to pull together many more. ""I wanted people to know that this is my experience, this is how ADHD affects me. I'm not saying that most people experience this, but it's been nice hearing from people who don't have ADHD but do relate to the pictures, as well as people who have it, or have loved ones who have been diagnosed. ""It's when they go 'Wow, this really helps me understand it a lot better' or 'Wow, I didn't know we had so much in common.' ""I've had people reach out to me and message me to tell me that when they looked at the whole range of experiences in the series, they related to every single one and sought out a therapist. Some of them got diagnosed and are being treated."" However, Dani is quick to stress that the images are not a diagnostic tool, and shouldn't be considered as such. ""If people ask me, 'Does this mean I have ADHD?' my answer is always going to be 'No, it definitely doesn't, but if you've read through the entire body of work and you feel every single thing hits home or if you are crying because you've got so many different experiences and haven't been understood, then you should think about speaking to a doctor or someone else.' ""Being able to have these open conversations, especially in the workplace, is one of the biggest areas where people can struggle. I'd like to be able to help with that. I'd like my graphics to help people to understand their children a bit better too."" Dani says one of her biggest fears was showcasing her images to the world: ""The larger the audience gets, the more criticism will happen. I was worried about people saying 'Everybody's like this, you know - don't blame it on your ADHD' or 'Everybody's a little ADHD and you're lazy or making excuses'. People with the diagnosis hear that a lot already. ""But I've mainly had positive feedback. There are a lot of supportive people out there who are getting involved in the conversation and saying that this is part of a larger body of work - one graphic doesn't tell the whole story."" All images courtesy of Dani Donovan","When Dani Donovan wanted to show her colleagues what life was like for her as someone diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), she never thought her sketches would lead to a series of web comics with a celebrity fan base."

"By Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague TV journalists, columnists, politicians and a leading economist signed an open letter accusing GeenStijl of denigrating women and online intimidation, as well as racism and homophobia. They accused big brands such as Rabobank and the Efteling theme park as well as the Dutch ministry of defence of ""paying the salaries of the most influential trolls on the internet"". Now several advertisers have responded by pulling their ads, including the brewer Grolsch, the furniture store Ikea and the Dutch tax office. GeenStijl has been shock-blogging for 14 years and describes its stance as ""tendentious, unfounded and gratuitously offensive"". So why call for a boycott now? The row began when columnist Rosanne Hertzberger wrote an article critical of companies that advertised on the site. ""You can reduce naked women to stage props,"" she wrote. ""I find it revolting but for me freedom goes quite a long way. The question is which advertisers are making this content possible."" When another columnist, Loes Reijmer, added her voice to the criticism, Geenstijl's editor Bart Nijman posted a photo of her on the site, asking readers ""Would you do her?"" That unleashed an army of aggressive, often anonymous, trolls. Their comments were graphic. They included threats to rape or inflict twisted forms of sexual assault and other violent acts. Most are too grotesque or offensive to publish here. This time the website had crossed a line, the women decided, and the public boycott campaign was launched. Among those signing the open letter were: They urged advertisers to end their relationship with GeenStijl, as they had a responsibility to customers not to ""support a site where the humiliation of women and racism is the norm, not the exception"". They asked them to consider whether appearing in this kind of environment was in line with the values of their companies. Education Minister Jet Bussemaker and several other politicians have backed the women and told Dutch TV they had to ""take a stand"" to protect women from being pilloried online. Politicians from the liberal D66 and Green-Left parties raised the issue in parliament and now several companies and government ministries have voted with their feet. Rabobank told the BBC it placed adverts where it expected to reach the desired audience and no longer used GeenStijl's video-sharing sister site Dumpert. What is GeenStijl? A small but influential blog, it attracts almost 2m unique visitors a month and has 88,000 followers on Twitter. Critics say it is racist, sexist, unashamed click bait and offers ""a place for pathetic people to vent their frustrations"". But its readers argue it is refreshing and a political correctness-free zone. Its bloggers promote themselves as protectors of free expression and are proud of their position as provocateurs. By way of a disclaimer it once wrote a relatively tame article about me, referring to me as a ""Page Three girl"", including a holiday snap that has since been removed. GeenStijl is also part of the Telegraaf Media Groep (TMG), one of the largest media organisations in the Netherlands. Is this censorship? GeenStijl itself has responded with a blog accusing politicians of trying to censor it. One former editor on the site, Annabel Nanninga, said sexism was being used as an excuse to shut it down because it had been ""a thorn in the eye"" for 14 years. One TV presenter has condemned the support for the anti-GeenStijl campaign as ""terrifying"". By ""naming and shaming"" advertisers, the columnists were not only jeopardising the blog's income but its very existence. ""I readily remind my profession that moral indignation is always selective,"" warned Roderick Veelo. Today it was GeenStijl, he suggested, but tomorrow it would be another and before you knew it it could be your turn.","A Dutch shock blog has been hit by an advertising boycott, after a campaign launched by more than 140 women."
"Magician Martyn Smith, 32, and church warden Benjamin Field, 28, are accused of killing Peter Farquhar, 69, in Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire. Prosecutors also allege they planned to kill his neighbour, Ann Moore-Martin, 83, to benefit from their wills. Buckingham University's head of welfare Deidre Bunker said student Mr Smith told her Mr Farquhar was an alcoholic. She told jurors at Oxford Crown Court that when Mr Smith sought bereavement support, ""he said a friend of his had recently died and he felt distressed, sad and quite angry. ""He said Mr Farquhar was an alcoholic and thought that he had dementia originally and he was quite angry that he had died from alcoholism."" Mr Farquhar was found dead in his home in October 2015 with a half-empty bottle of whisky next to him. His death was treated as alcohol-related after a pathologist found he was three-times the drink-drive limit, a concentration capable of causing his death. The jury heard Mr Smith had been in a pub drinking on the day of Mr Farquhar's death and told friends he ""couldn't remember anything after 6pm"". Prosecutors allege he and Mr Field murdered him at his home. The court previously heard Mr Field was engaged to Mr Farquhar and had also seduced Ms Moore-Martin - persuading them both to change their wills. The defendants tried to make the pair think they were losing their minds, prosecutors claim. They allegedly laced Mr Farquhar's food and drink with drugs and neat alcohol and wrote ""messages from God"" on mirrors belonging to Ms Moore-Martin, who died of natural causes in May 2017. Mr Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, possessing an article for the use in fraud and an alternative charge of attempted murder. He has admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. Mr Smith, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, two charges of fraud and one of burglary. The trial continues.","A man accused of murdering a university lecturer was ""distressed, sad and quite angry"" after the death, a court heard."
"It reported Mr Cameron as saying that the appointment could destabilise the UK government and bring forward referendum plans on EU membership. Downing Street has not yet commented. Mr Juncker told a German newspaper that his opponents should not be allowed to ""blackmail"" the EU. The former Luxembourg PM was quoted in Bild - Germany's biggest newspaper - as saying he remains confident of becoming the next president of the European Commission. Correspondents say Mr Cameron, at an informal EU summit earlier this week, made his views clear - that he wanted a reformer to take charge of the EU executive. Mr Juncker's European People's Party won the largest number of seats in the European parliament in the May polls. The centre-right grouping, which also includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, won 213 out of 751 seats in the Parliament and chose Mr Juncker as its candidate for the presidency to succeed Portugal's Jose Manuel Barroso. But Mr Cameron and several other European leaders have voiced opposition to his appointment, which has received the backing of Chancellor Merkel. Brussels warning Der Spiegel says the British prime minister issued the warning to Angela Merkel during the meeting in Brussels. Quoting ""sources close to the participants"" of the summit, the influential magazine said Mr Cameron told Chancellor Merkel that selecting Mr Juncker could destabilise his government to such an extent that an in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership would have to be brought forward. The magazine quotes Mr Cameron as telling the German chancellor that ""a face from the 1980s cannot solve the problems of the next five years"". A senior government source told the BBC it did not recognise the language about destabilisation and that it is not something the prime minister would have said. Jean-Claude Juncker But the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says it is no secret that Mr Cameron opposes Mr Juncker and that the UK view is that the need for change is well-established. The report comes a day after Angela Merkel made her clearest statement yet of support for Mr Juncker and leaves her in a difficult position, our correspondent says. He adds that much of the German political establishment believes Mr Juncker should get the job because his party will be the largest political grouping. EU leaders traditionally choose the Commission head on their own, but under new rules have to ""take into account"" the results of the European elections. Downing Street has emphasised that it will be national governments - not the European parliament - which will have to agree on the president. Mr Juncker's main rival is the Socialist candidate Martin Schulz. Mr Juncker is known for his role in chairing the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers that had to make tough decisions about struggling debt-laden countries. Mr Juncker is not thought to be amenable to a wide-ranging renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels. Other leaders opposing the appointment include Sweden's Fredrik Reinfeldt and Hungary's Viktor Orban.",German magazine Der Spiegel says British PM David Cameron warned that the UK could leave the EU if Luxembourg ex-PM Jean-Claude Juncker became president of the European Commission.
"The government scheme came to light when one of the letters, which were sent to about 200 Irish republicans, caused an IRA bomb trial to collapse. Secretary of State Theresa Villiers said those who received letters should no longer rely on them as a defence. She said it applied to all available evidence against them, ""old or new"". Ms Villiers had previously said that the letters would not protect paramilitary suspects from prosecution if fresh evidence emerged against them. Controversy Giving evidence to an an MPs' inquiry into the scheme on Wednesday, the secretary of state said that the government was ""no longer standing by"" the letters because ""errors"" were made at the time when some of the them were written. She said they could no longer be relied on ""even as statements of fact"". The government letters were addressed to more than 200 republican paramilitary suspects, informing them that they were not being sought by the police for questioning about Troubles-related offences. ""The government no longer stands behind them because we cannot be certain that they were accurate and reliable at the time,"" Ms Villiers told MPs. ""So there can be no question of looking back at past decisions by prosecutors and the police. What will count is - what is the evidence available today? Does that justify arrest? Does that justify prosecution? ""That decision will be made by today's police and prosecutors regardless of what judgments were made in the past about whether someone was wanted or not. ""Today's decision will be made by today's prosecutors on the basis of all evidence regardless of when it first became available."" The On the Runs scheme became the focus of controversy after the collapse of a case against John Downey in February for the 1982 Hyde Park bombing. Mr Downey was wrongly told he was not wanted by any UK police force. However, he was still being sought by the Met. 'Abuse of process' On Wednesday, Ms Villiers gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster, which resumed its inquiry into the letters scheme following a summer recess. She told MPs that she had taken legal advice on the issue and had concluded making a statement to the House of Commons was the best way to ""remove barriers"" to future prosecutions. However, the she said that there was no 100% guarantee that the government could prevent a future ""abuse of process"" or the collapse of a trial. Committee members repeatedly asked Ms Villiers to identify the recipients of the letters. However, she refused to reveal their names, saying it could jeopardise potential future prosecutions or put the safety of individuals at risk. The secretary of state was also asked if the Northern Ireland Office would write new letters to all the paramilitary suspects involved in the on the runs scheme, to inform them of the government's current position. 'Key change' She said it would be unlikely that her office could get up to date addresses for all of the people involved, and added that she was confident a general statement to parliament was the most effective way of getting the message across. Ms Villiers told the inquiry: ""The key change that we need to make is to make it absolutely clear that the government no longer stands by those statements of fact."" She added: ""Whether evidence is old or whether it's new, it's going to be a matter for today's prosecutors to decide whether that justifies arrest and prosecution, so they do not have an effect of protecting people from prosecution in any way."" Shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Ivan Lewis, said there was ""an urgent need for the government to clarify its position regarding the on the run scheme"". ""At a time when stability in Northern Ireland is so fragile it is essential the government is clear and unambiguous about its response to sensitive issues,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Office's permanent secretary, Sir Jonathan Stephens, also appeared before the committee. In July, a separate review into the scheme by Lady Justice Hallet found that it was flawed but not an amnesty for those who received letters.","The Northern Ireland secretary has said the government is ""no longer standing by"" letters sent to 'on the runs'."

"They warned this could be the first of a number of demonstrations over plans for a new nuclear power station at the site. Power firm EDF said of 500 employees at the plant, only essential staff had been called in and had arrived by bus at dawn. Deliveries had also been re-scheduled. An EDF spokesman said: ""The station's still generating power and essential staff are on site."" Any unexpected deliveries had been taken to an alternative entrance. The spokesman said: ""We trust the protest will be peaceful and we recognise their rights as part of the democratic process in this county. ""The station is still generating power for one million homes and essential staff are on site running the station. ""Officers from Avon and Somerset Police are here as part of our contingency measures as safety is a top priority."" 'Symbolic protest' Protesters had gathered outside the main gate of Hinkley Point, which is on a rural road about 10 miles from Bridgwater. BBC reporter Ruth Bradley said: ""It's a peaceful protest with demonstrators playing music and walking around with radiation monitors and talking to police. ""There are lots of police riot vans and officers here."" Avon and Somerset Police said one man was arrested at the demonstration on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. Camilla Berens, from Kick Nuclear, said the blockade was ""symbolic"". She said: ""The government is trying to bamboozle people into thinking nuclear power is essential to keep the lights on. ""At the moment there isn't a debate, the government's told everybody you've got to have it whether you like it or not and we're countering that, saying, actually nuclear's the last thing we need."" Protesters, who have been operating in informal shifts, also released 206 helium balloons - representing the number of days since the Japanese nuclear disaster at Fukushima. EDF Energy wants to build a new nuclear power station, Hinkley C, at the site by 2020, which it says would provide enough energy for five million homes. It is hoped the current station, Hinkley B, would continue to operate alongside it. Peter Higginson, technical and safety support manager at Hinkley B, said: ""We need a balanced mix of energy and nuclear plays a part, along with other means of electricity and renewables."" Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has announced the deadline on the public consultation into Hinkley C has been extended from 6 October to 15 December.",Up to 400 protesters blockaded the entrance to Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.
"It came after the team bus failed to turn up, leaving the players having to make their own way to London and unable to transport their tactics board. So, boss Gary Simpson used the sweets on one of the kit lockers to demonstrate the team's formation. He praised the players' ""fantastic team spirit"" in the circumstances. He told BBC Radio Lincolnshire he would not rule out using jelly babies in future. ""If we can keep winning I will do whatever is necessary,"" he said. Striker Ben Tomlinson took a photo behind the manager's shoulder and tweeted ""Funny tactics board"". The idea has already been copied by young players from Lincoln City FC Youth Academy, as shown in a photo tweeted by coach Matthew Petch. Lincoln City FC is looking into why the team bus did not turn up. ""We turned up in drips and drabs a little bit, but we all got down,"" said Mr Simpson. ""It wasn't the best situation to be in, especially when you are going to the league leaders that haven't conceded a goal, and had got off to an absolutely unbelievable start."" He said the team often has jelly babies ahead of matches, but players usually eat them instead of using them as a substitute tactics board.",The manager of Lincoln City FC has revealed how he used jelly babies to help the team win against league leaders Barnet on Saturday.
"By Michael BuchananBBC News Documents and interviews with ex-officers suggested the force failed to pursue a number of child sexual exploitation (CSE) inquiries. It also ignored intelligence that girls as young as 12 were being raped and assaulted, the officer told the BBC. The force said CSE inquiries were complex and could take a long time. Two former senior officers are being investigated by the police watchdog over their handling of CSE allegations in Sheffield. Threats to kill A copy of a document from South Yorkshire Police's intelligence database details more than 200 girls in Sheffield who were suspected of being sexually exploited. It also lists more than 320 men accused of carrying out abuse, mainly between 2007 and 2010. The abuse includes: Most of the girls are aged 13 to 15 but some are as young as 12. The nationalities of the alleged abusers include a mixture of Iraqi Kurds, white British, black British, and Pakistani Heritage, among others. The document lists three members of the same family linked to the alleged abuse of almost three-dozen girls. In most cases there is no evidence police took any action. Ann Lucas, who set up and ran Sheffield council's sexual exploitation service until 2012, said she recognised some girls and many alleged perpetrators in the file. She said: ""This is a snapshot of some of the victims we had [worked with] over a number of years, but not every victim is on the document you've shown me."" ""The information [we were getting]... was routinely passed in to the police. There was no way they could not have known."" 'Most vulnerable' people Some of the abuse claims detailed in the document were investigated and prosecutions did follow. In 2007, one investigation known as Operation Glover led to the conviction of a group of Iraqi-Kurdish men - two of whom received 10-year prison sentences while two others received substantial custodial sentences. Following that investigation at least two detectives urged senior officers to continue enquiries. Other girls had been identified, allegations had been made, and new potential perpetrators had been pinpointed. A 2007 report sent to several senior officers described an ""emerging criminal issue"" in Sheffield, saying the level of criminality was ""serious"", and the victims were ""among the most vulnerable in society"". It also said South Yorkshire Police did ""not have any effective process or policy to combat the situation"". Among the senior officers who were sent the 2007 report were Jon House and Paul Broadbent - according to Tony Brookes, who had worked as a detective on the investigation. Both have now left the police but are the subject of Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigations over previous allegations they failed to act on child sexual exploitation claims. Despite the substantial problems identified, the team was disbanded. Mr Brookes told BBC News: ""The size of the exploitation was massive in Sheffield. ""We offered to form a unit to continue the work - we offered to advertise our work so girls would come forward. We were told, 'it's not going to happen, return to your districts.'"" Mr Brookes said he was called to a meeting with a still-serving officer to discuss what to do with the intelligence they had on other girls. ""He said to me, 'go and spend an hour or two with each girl and find out what's happened to them and tell them there's not enough evidence to go on.""' Mr Brookes, who retired last year after 30 years' service, said he refused to carry out the order. The force's priorities at that time were mainly crimes including robbery, burglary and car crime due to mandatory targets set by the Home Office. 'Utter disbelief' In 2009, Sheffield City Council raised further concerns about the extent of abuse and trafficking in the area. The council asked police to start a new investigation and paid the force £50,000 towards the costs of Operation K-Safe, the BBC understands. A team of four detectives began investigations and arrests were made. But within months, two detectives left the team and were not replaced. In 2010, one of the force's most experienced analysts, Gary Birchall, was asked to report on the operation. He concluded a full investigation should be launched given the level and type of criminality detectives had identified but it never happened. Mr Birchall said: ""I got a call telling me the operation's been shelved. ""I said it can't be shelved, there's evidence here that children are being trafficked, being sexually abused. There isn't a superlative that describes how I felt then or how I feel now. Utter, utter, disbelief."" 'Wrong and misleading' South Yorkshire Police said some of the intelligence gathered as part of Operation K-Safe eventually led to Amanda Spencer and Ian Foster being jailed last year for 12 and 14 years respectively. Arrests and investigations could only go ahead when there was sufficient evidence, the force said in a statement. It added: ""We have developed strong processes to ensure all information and intelligence received about sexual exploitation is collated, shared with partners and reviewed on a very frequent basis to see if any further action can be taken."" Jon House, who is now a senior manager with consultancy firm PWC, told the BBC: ""Any suggestion that I did not support investigations into CSE is wrong and misleading. ""I will respond to the IPCC and look forward to the full facts being established."" Paul Broadbent, who is now the head of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, said: ""It would be wholly spurious and wrong to say that I did not support allegations or investigations into child sexual exploitation in Sheffield. ""I very much welcome and will fully cooperate with any independent investigation.""","South Yorkshire Police knew hundreds of young girls were making claims of sexual abuse in Sheffield but did not act, an ex-police officer has alleged."
"By Peter CoulterBBC News NI Other parts of the UK have a one-year deferral period for men who have had sex with men and want to donate, but Northern Ireland has an outright ban. A judge has ruled the health minister did not have the power to keep the ban. The current health minister, Jim Wells, is appealing the judgment. John O'Doherty from gay support group, the Rainbow project, said there was no medical evidence to justify the ban imposed by former health minister Edwin Poots, DUP. He told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday: ""It is a ridiculous situation. ""We supported a lifetime ban during the Aids crisis because it was in response to medical need. ""This is a decision that has to be made on a medical basis. We are continually hearing from the blood service that they need blood, yet we are blanket saying no to gay and bi-sexual men. ""At the same time, Northern Ireland is taking blood from Scotland where they have removed the ban on gay and bi-sexual men giving blood."" Mr O'Doherty said the equality legislation was ""only as strong as those who implement it"". The bar on gay men donating blood was put in place across the UK during the Aids crisis of the 1980s, but was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011. New rules were introduced that allowed blood donations from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year earlier, but Northern Ireland did not follow suit. A gay man, granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability, launched a judicial review challenge to the then health minister Edwin Poots' decision not to adopt the same policy on this side of the Irish Sea. A judge ruled that Mr Poots' decision was ""irrational"" and ""infected with apparent bias"". Mr Poots said he had kept the ban on the basis of ensuring public safety. Under a freedom of information request, the BBC asked the Department of Health to release any medical evidence it held that supported the minister's decision to continue to enforce the lifetime ban. The response stated that ""this department does not hold any papers in relation to medical evidence to support maintaining the permanent blood donor deferral for men who have had sex with men donating blood"". ""The department takes advice on blood safety matters from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO). ""SaBTO was content that based on this and other evidence, a change to 12 month deferral would maintain the safety of blood transfusions, and recommended that communications about policy change should emphasise the importance of compliance. ""SaBTO found that the evidence no longer supported a lifetime ban."" The SaBTO evidence held by the department says that with enhanced compliance the risk of HIV being released into the blood supply ""could be reduced to as low as 0.161 per million donations"". Appeal Mr Poots said in 2012 that he had seen two pieces of evidence that had helped him make his decision to maintain the ban. The BBC understands that these pieces of evidence were a letter and a European Council report. The BBC has now obtained a copy of the letter from the former Irish Health Minister James Reilly and the European Council report and has published them online. In a subsequent letter to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, in July 2014, Mr Reilly asked for a review of the position in the Republic of Ireland. He said he was ""concerned that the ban on donation of blood by gay men may no longer be justified on scientific grounds"". In January 2012, the director general of health improvement and protection in the Department of Health in Whitehall replied to a letter from the Stormont health department on the issue. Prof David Harper wrote that it was ""SaBTO's clear view that the available evidence showed that lifetime deferral for blood donations from men who have had sex with men was no longer appropriate."" He added: ""Our decision on such blood donations is based on these findings, and, we were also minded that for our policy on permanent deferral to be lawful and defensible, it would need to be proportionate and based on reasonable grounds."" The Northern Ireland Department of Health has issued a statement saying: ""As the appeal is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment on matters that are before the courts."" In a recent ministerial question, Mr Wells revealed that £40,000 had so far been spent on legal fees challenging the ruling. It has also been revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices. The department also confirmed it had not made any attempt to prevent blood from the rest of the UK coming into Northern Ireland. Mr Poots and Mr Wells are members of the DUP, which said that it was not appropriate to comment while the case was ongoing. Sinn Féin MLA Maeve McLaughlin, chair of Stormont's health committee, has called for the ban to be lifted immediately. ""There is a very clear equality issue at the heart of all of this and there is the issue of public funding,"" she said. ""It has been clearly documented and stated that there is no medical evidence to support this outright ban. It should be lifted. This has gone through a judicial court process where it has been deemed irrational. ""Lift this ban and halt all court proceedings.""","Northern Ireland's Department of Health does not have any medical evidence of its own to support a permanent ban on gay men donating blood, a BBC investigation has found."

"Dame Louise Casey urged the prime minister to delay the rollout of the new benefit system so it can be fixed. A dozen Tory MPs are calling for it to be paused, the Daily Telegraph says. Official figures show 24% of new Universal Credit claimants wait longer than six weeks to be paid in full - causing many to fall behind on rent. That could make a big difference to families who were ""close to the edge,"" Dame Louise told the BBC. They ""will end up in dire circumstances, more dire than I think we have seen in this country for years"". The government says the new system, which merges six existing benefits into one, offers extra support and that budgeting and financial help is available. Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Gauke is expected to make a decision in the coming days about whether the rollout should be accelerated. 'Work should pay' But Dame Louise, who has advised four prime ministers on social policy over the past 18 years, including Mrs May, said the implementation had to be got right. ""I completely agree that we all should be wedded to the principle, and therefore the overall policy, that work should pay,"" she said. But she added: ""If it means that we are looking at more and more people that are ending up homeless, or ending up having their kids taken away, or ending up in more dire circumstances, that cannot be the intention. ""It can't be and it won't be the intention of Theresa May or [First Secretary of State] Damian Green or any of those people. I just don't believe that they would want that to happen."" She suggested ministers were blindly ""pressing on"" with the policy because they did not want to be accused of doing a U-turn. But she said: ""It's like jumping over a cliff - once you have jumped, people end up at the bottom and we don't want that to happen."" Homeless 'because of Universal Credit' Garry Dunningham, 24, lives in a tent by the river in Great Yarmouth. He says he and his girlfriend were evicted from their shared flat about six months ago once their landlord found out they were on Universal Credit. ""Basically because we were on Universal Credit and he's had a lot of people not paying the rent... we got kicked out."" Garry says he has tried 58 private landlords across the town but no-one will take them. ""As soon as I go to meet them and say I am on Universal Credit, it's a no: 'We ain't got no rooms.'"" He says being homeless has affected his chances of finding work: ""You need an address. It's a vicious circle."" He has even offered to pay rent and a deposit in advance ""but they won't even do that"". ""No-one's giving us the benefit of the doubt. You can't always judge everyone by what other people have done but that's what they're doing. ""I've walked down the street and there's been house after house empty... and no one will let us in."" The BBC understands Tory MPs, led by Heidi Allen, have written to Mr Gauke, demanding the national rollout of the policy be paused. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams welcomed the move, saying a ""pause"" could be used to bring in advance payments, rather than loans, for struggling families and to scrap charges for calling the Universal Credit helpline number, among other things. Conservative MP Stephen McPartland said his concern with Universal Credit was that for ""every pound these people earn, extra, the government's taking 63p back off them"". ""To me that is an effective tax rate of 63%, which is ridiculous. So the lowest paid are effectively having to pay some of the highest taxes,"" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One. The Department of Work and Pensions said Universal Credit was working and people were moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. ""The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money. Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help,"" a spokesman said. Dame Louise first came to prominence as Tony Blair's ""anti-social behaviour tsar"" and also led a programme for David Cameron to tackle ""troubled families"". She has now left the government to work for an international homelessness charity. She also told the BBC she was concerned that a report she published last year on integration had been placed in a box marked ""too difficult"". The government has yet to issue a formal response to the review, which accuses public bodies of ignoring or condoning divisive or harmful religious practices for fear of being called racist.","Families could be left homeless and destitute if Theresa May insists on pressing ahead with Universal Credit, a former top adviser has warned."
"Ballot boxes are being transported to counts across the country where the candidates await the results following the closure of the polls at 22:00 GMT. About 46 million people were eligible to elect 650 members of Parliament to the House of Commons - 533 of whom were for constituencies in England. It was the first December election in almost a century and the third general election in the country since 2015.

"Amol RajanMedia editor He will have felt a surge of adrenaline when, this morning, he sat in the editor's chair at the Evening Standard for the first time. And thank goodness, because his new working hours mean he has to wake up at about 5am. Here are six priorities in his new role. 1) Set out an editorial vision Leadership is about vision, articulating where you want your team to reach - perhaps some shining city upon a hill. Management is the daily trudge to get there. The first thing any new editor has to do is set out very clearly where he wants to take the organ. Who is it for, where will it sit politically, what key changes is he intent on making, and so on. I can imagine Osborne saying, when he addresses staff after the first edition is sent to the printers, that London is his home city, the place of his birth, and that he wants the Standard to be a paper for London, by Londoners. He might say: ""For the past 20 years I've been a Conservative, but always a liberal one, and now I want us to fight for the liberal mainstream majority in this city."" Since leaving No 11, Osborne has missed running things. He'll enjoy being a boss again. 2) Prove he knows about journalism Editors depend for their efficacy on authority, and specifically the authority to make things happen - that is, power. The sources of authority are several: First, natural authority, which comes from your manner, reputation, and character. Second, the intellectual force of your leadership and vision. Third, a strong mandate from the proprietor. And fourth, knowledge of the craft you now practise. And here Osborne is starting with - to use a term he knows well - a deficit. Since his student days, he hasn't rewritten a picture caption, designed a front page, or converted the seventh paragraph of his most pompous columnist's weekly contribution into an intro. All this will take time, as will getting comfortable with some of the jargon beloved by old print hands, who talk of widows and orphans constantly (don't ask). Osborne needs to impose himself intellectually and journalistically to persuade his colleagues he isn't an amateur. A masterstroke of a splash headline this week would help. So too would a gentle redesign. Readers can get annoyed at redesigns, but given this paper is free, they might forgive it, and for Osborne it could be an unbeatable way to excite staff, show he cares about the small print (literally), and break with the past. 3) Build his relationship with the staff Osborne has done this several times of course, not least at the Treasury. Newspapers are generally very hierarchical places. He will quickly discover that if one of his specialists or a desk editors is off sick, the paper will still come out, but when the lowest-paid among the production staff catches a flu, the paper is full of errors, he gets a nasty fine for being late, and the darn thing nearly fails to be printed. Aside from getting to know junior staff in editorial and production, Osborne will need to get to know all the commercial staff too, because the Standard's business model is so dependent on selling ads. He went round and introduced himself to them all when he went into the office a few months ago, and ought to do that again. 4) Reimagine the business model, and talk about a turnaround The Standard's business model is under immense pressure. Being free, it has no cover price revenue and is therefore funded mainly by print display advertising. But that market is disappearing fast and, although the Standard has mostly fixed distribution costs, Osborne needs to find new revenues - quickly. Bringing in high-profile speakers for big events is one way to achieve this and he will need to call in some big favours very soon. Mike Bloomberg, Christine Lagarde, David Cameron and even his chum Emmanuel Macron should expect calls. As chancellor, Osborne grasped the importance of a turnaround, or crisis-and-resolution, narrative. This is not unique to UK politics: Mitt Romney wrote a book called Turnaround. Just as, years ago, the austerity chancellor left voters in no doubt that Britain's economy was on the brink, so as to justify some harsh medicine, so he may talk openly in coming weeks about why the crisis in the advertising market makes it necessary for him to make painful decisions, including any sackings. 5) Pick a fight with government I spoke to one Standard hack over the weekend who said ""Theresa May has done us a massive favour!"" The fact that Osborne is no longer MP for Tatton in Cheshire means he'll have more time available, will be less dogged by controversy over his split loyalties, and will evade (some) censure for holding too many jobs. But he still has to prove his independence from government. To be seen as a Tory lackey would be fatal for his authority. So expect a major assault on the government's handling of Brexit, or perhaps the announcement of a new columnist from the Left. Jeremy Corbyn could be prime minister in a few weeks but if he isn't then, as a veteran London MP, perhaps he could be a candidate for the editor's favour? Goodness knows whether his prose is elegant, though. 6) Prove he's not compromised by BlackRock As I've argued several times now, it is very hard to see how Osborne can reconcile being in charge of the City pages with his work for BlackRock. Aside from the time commitment, if any of BlackRock's clients are in the news Osborne faces a choice: Even if he doesn't realise it. Is he covering them as an impartial, ferocious editor, prepared to stand up to the mighty? Or is the fact that he gets paid £650,000 for four days' work every month going to enter his mind, as his fingers hover over the keyboard and he formulates a headline?",George Osborne has had countless exhilarating moments in his career - and plenty of grim ones too.
"The star made the surprise statement during a recording of The Late Show with David Letterman on Thursday. Letterman, 66, is one of the biggest names on US TV.

He said he had told his CBS bosses he would step down in about a year's time, when his current contract expires. Referring to CBS chairman Leslie Moonves, Letterman told his audience: ""I phoned him just before the programme, and I said, 'Leslie, it's been great, you've been great, and the network has been great, but I'm retiring.'"" Letterman thanked ""all of the people who have worked here, all of the people in the theatre, all the people on the staff, everybody at home - thank you very much"". Letterman is known for his mixture of big-name interviews and comedy features like his irreverent top 10 lists and segments like Monkey Cam, in which a TV camera was strapped to a monkey while it roamed the studio. The star began his career as a radio talk show host and local TV weatherman, before becoming part of a comedy troupe on a CBS variety series starring Mary Tyler Moore in 1978. He was given his own morning programme on NBC show two years later. It only lasted a matter of months, despite winning two Emmy awards. Late Night with David Letterman followed, and he began to be seen by many as the natural successor to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. But when he lost that slot to Jay Leno following Carson's retirement in 1992, Letterman moved to CBS and began a long-running rivalry with Leno. Leno was on top in the ratings for most of their two-decade duel. Letterman's departure comes two months after Leno stepped down from The Tonight Show. Leno was replaced by Jimmy Fallon, whose show averages 5.1 million viewers a week, compared with 2.9 million for Letterman, according to Nielsen ratings. CBS chairman Leslie Moonves praised Letterman's ""wit, gravitas and brilliance"". He continued: ""Dave has given television audiences thousands of hours of comedic entertainment, the sharpest interviews in late night, and brilliant moments of candour and perspective around national events. ""He's also managed to keep many celebrities, politicians and executives on their toes - including me."" Replacement rumours Jimmy Kimmel, who hosts a rival talk show on ABC, tweeted: ""David Letterman is the best there is and ever was."" Speculation has already begun about his replacement, with Craig Ferguson, Jon Stewart, Conan O' Brien, Chelsea Handler and Stephen Colbert among those being tipped. Lena Dunham, star of the HBO show Girls, tweeted that she hoped CBS would cast a wider net. She wrote: ""I love Letterman but I am really excited about what this could mean for the diversification of late night. Trying not to be a pessimist..."" FIVE CLASSIC LETTERMAN MOMENTS Twenty years ago, Madonna had to be censored after swearing more than a dozen times. She also lit up a cigar and gave Letterman her underwear and invited him to smell it. The episode earned some of the highest ratings of Letterman's career. The host, with his humorous put-downs and refusal to yield to her shock tactics, came out on top. With a reputation as a wild child back in 1995, actress Drew Barrymore jumped onto his desk and did a dance before flashing her breasts at the host. ""I can't thank you enough for that,"" Letterman said after he had regained his composure. His show is not all light-hearted banter. The host delivered a highly-charged and heartfelt opening monologue after the attacks of 11 September 2001. ""If you didn't believe it before - and it's easy to understand how you might have been sceptical on this point - if you didn't believe it before, you can absolutely believe it now: New York City is the greatest city in the world,"" he said. In 2009, Letterman told his audience someone had tried to blackmail him over claims he had affairs with female members of the programme staff. ""I have had sex with women who worked on this show,"" he admitted. ""Would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would. Especially for the women."" Also in 2009, actor Joaquin Phoenix appeared incoherent and unrecognisable, with unkempt hair and bushy beard. ""Joaquin, I'm sorry you couldn't be here tonight,"" Letterman quipped. A year later, Phoenix went back on the show to admit it was a stunt for a mock documentary he was making about quitting acting to pursue a hip-hop career.",Veteran US late-night TV host David Letterman has announced that he is to retire in 2015.
"He was speaking as he inspected the cable-laying barge visible from Jersey's east coast. It has laid 21km (13 miles) of the 32km (20 mile) Normandie 3 cable connecting the island to France. The Channel Islands suffered a major power cut in January because of a fault which originated in France. Mr Ambler said the new cable was ""separate and resilient"" from the existing connector, Normandie 2. ""It's also going to be buried all the way and connected to a different part of the network in France; a much more secure part,"" he said. The 100MW Normandie 3 supply line is being buried two metres (6ft) beneath the seabed by the Cable Enterprise vessel. The 7,000-tonne barge, operated by Prymsian Powerlink, is visible from Gorey as it edges towards Long Beach, where it is due to arrive in mid-June.","A power line being laid between Jersey and France will be more secure than the existing connection, Jersey Electric chief executive Chris Ambler has said."
"The 19-year-old was found guilty of causing public mischief, prompting the Foreign Office to express ""serious concern"" about the case in Ayia Napa. Critics of the verdict have called for people to avoid visiting Cyprus. The woman's mother told the BBC that Ayia Napa - where her daughter had been on a working holiday - was unsafe. The 19-year-old was convicted following a trial after recanting a claim that she was raped in a hotel room in July. The teenager has said Cypriot police made her falsely confess to lying about the incident at a hotel - something police have denied. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the teenager's mother - who the BBC is not naming - said she believed her daughter's experience in Ayia Napa was not an isolated incident. She said: ""The place isn't safe - it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that's happened to you, you're either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what's happened to my daughter may happen."" The Independent's travel editor Simon Calder said about one in three visitors to Cyprus were British, with more than 1.3 million Brits visiting Cyprus in 2019. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme his two daughters and their friends have said they would not travel to Ayia Napa, adding: ""I imagine that there are similar conversations going on around the kitchen table in many homes with teenage children."" However, he said he doubted the Foreign Office would implement a travel ban because Cyprus is ""generally a very safe country for British travellers"". Lawyers representing the woman have criticised the conviction and the way the case was handled by the Cypriot police and Judge Michalis Papathanasiou. They say her retraction statement was given when no lawyer or translator was present and point to the fact the judge refused to hear any evidence about whether the alleged rape took place. The Foreign Office has described the conviction as ""deeply distressing"" and pledged to raise the issue with Cypriot authorities. Several senior legal figures in Cyprus have signed a letter written to the Attorney General Costas Clerides asking him to intervene in the case, including former Justice Minister Kypros Chrysostomides. Mr Chrysostomides said the teenager had ""already suffered a lot"" and he expects her sentence will be ""very lenient"". He added: ""She has already been in detention for four and a half weeks and she has already been prevented from travelling for about five months already."" The teenager faces up to a year in jail and a £1,500 fine when she is sentenced on 7 January, but he said such punishments would be ""excessive under the circumstances"". The woman's mother said she had not personally heard from the Foreign Office, but added that she ""would love"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to get involved. She said she understood that the judicial process had to be followed but ""when that starts becoming broken"" it was necessary for the authorities to step in, adding that her daughter had experienced human rights violations ""throughout"" the process. She also questioned the authenticity of her daughter's retraction statement - local police said it had been written by her daughter but she cited an expert witness who said it was ""highly improbable"" that it had been produced by a native English speaker. When delivering the guilty verdict on Monday, the judge said his decision was backed up by video evidence showing the woman having consensual sex. But her mother said the video showed her daughter having consensual sex with one man, and then it showed a group of people trying to enter the room. ""[The video] shows her and the guy telling them to get out of the room,"" she said. ""That gives you a very strong flavour of what happens next."" The 12 men arrested in connection with the alleged rape were later released and returned home. A lawyer representing some of them welcomed the guilty verdict, saying the woman had ""refused to this day to take responsibility for the horrible act she's done against the boys"". 'Re-think her options' The woman's mother said her daughter was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, hallucinations, and was sleeping for 18 or 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia. ""She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated - that's my absolute primary focus. She can't be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode... ""It needs resolving otherwise she's going to carry on having this for the rest of her life."" The woman's mother also revealed that her daughter had planned to start university this year after being accepted by all of the universities she applied for. ""She'd been offered a bursary at one of them - she'd got three unconditional offers. ""So, no question, she would have gone to university, but it was in a career that she wouldn't be able to do with this 'public mischief' verdict, so - again, life-changing for her - she needs to totally rethink her options."" The woman's legal representatives have already said they plan to appeal against the conviction. The woman's mother said they plan to take the case to the Cyprus Supreme Court, but there is a long waiting list. ""Our lawyers are looking at what can be done to expedite that, and that's maybe something the Foreign Office could help us with, so to get that as soon as we can."" A GoFundMe page for legal costs has raised more than £80,000 towards a target of £100,000. The woman's mother said she was ""astounded"" by the support, but believed legal costs would end up being even greater than that. ""Unfortunately we're going to have to increase the target in a little bit to appeal with the appeal process. ""I'm not totally sure what the figure needs to be to do that yet, but we will be doing that."" Human rights campaigner Joan Smith told the BBC that the Foreign Office's strong response to the verdict was a ""very unusual"" and ""welcome"" intervention. She said: ""They wouldn't have done it if they hadn't felt that there were serious questions about the fairness of the trial that she's been through, but also the events leading up to that trial."" The Cypriot government responded to criticism by saying it had ""full confidence in the justice system and the courts"".",The mother of a British woman convicted in Cyprus of lying about being raped by 12 Israeli men has backed calls for tourists to boycott the country.
"Three-year-old Dalmatian Lottie was taken from Chloe Hopkins' home in Peatling Parva, Leicestershire, in early December. An appeal to find the dog was widely shared on social media and was backed by TV presenter Chris Packham. Chloe's mother, Gemma Hopkins, posted on a Facebook page about the appeal that Lottie's body had been found. She told the BBC the family was given the news on Sunday after Lottie's microchip was scanned by a vet. Leicestershire Police said the dog was found in a layby in Countesthorpe - about four miles (6.4km) away from the family's home - on Sunday morning. Lottie - who required specialist food for a liver condition - vanished on 1 December when thieves broke into the family home. Following the theft, Mrs Hopkins described the dog as her daughter's ""best friend"", saying she helped to keep her calm. She wrote on Facebook: ""Having to identify her was the hardest thing I've done. ""I've now got to break my 12-year-old's heart tonight. ""We never wanted this ending. We kept hopeful. Goodbye my crazy bunch of spots."" She told the BBC her daughter had since been given the news. Hundreds of people have shared their condolences on social media.

"Thames Valley Police chiefs will discuss the possibility of removing the mounted section by 2019, as they present budget proposals to the force's police and crime commissioner (PCC). PC Craig O'Leary, the force's federation chairman, said the removal of the unit would be a ""sad loss"". The unit is deployed to maintain public order at football matches and events. A police spokeswoman told the BBC scrapping the unit was one of three options being considered as the force continued to operate in an ""extremely challenging financial climate"". Other options put forward to PCC Anthony Stansfeld will be to maintain the unit in its current format or restructure it to ""deliver savings"". The force said ""various"" budget plans will be discussed at the meeting on 23 January, but the BBC understands the dog handling section could also suffer cuts. £99m saved PC O'Leary said deciding whether to scrap or keep mounted sections were ""sadly... a choice now that forces are facing"". He added: ""[The mounted section] are fantastic in bringing potential inflammatory situations back under control. From that perspective they are second to none."" PC O'Leary added ""no new money"" would diminish the force's services leaving them to rely on other mounted sections, such as that at the Metropolitan Police. Officers in the mounted unit, which is made up of nine horses and is based in Milton Keynes, would be redeployed if the section was removed. Since 2010/11, the force has had to make £99m of savings, which has resulted in a reduction of more than 450 police officers, figures show. A consultation by Mr Stansfeld seeking views on an increase in the police element of council tax by £1 a month - for a band D property - will end later.","A police force may scrap its mounted section as it makes ""stark choices"" to cope with funding cuts."
"She travelled with him on a three-day state visit to Washington this week. In comments made to French media, she said it was difficult to find peace and quiet on the job. When he was elected, Mr Macron ditched plans to create a first lady status, setting up an official role instead. ""What I do not like is that there is never [any] time off,"" she told French radio. ""Wherever you are, there is always someone to take your picture. There is never a time when you can be totally quiet. That's the most cumbersome side,"" These days, she says, reflecting on her role, ""one sometimes has the impression that every word is a word too many. That's a bit of a shame because one holds back constantly."" On the inside, she feels she is ""Emmanuel Macron's wife, not the wife of the president. I don't feel that I am a first lady,"" she adds. She acknowledges that she bears the responsibilities of a first lady, that of representing her country, but that ""otherwise I live a normal life; I meet people... I haven't changed, either in my head or in the way I live."" Upon Emmanuel Macron's election, Brigitte Macron was given an official role, funded from Mr Macron's budget. The new job - which does not carry the official title ""first lady"" - was defined as focusing on disabled people, education, children, women's issues, health and gender equality. It's not an easy role to carry out, she says: ""One is here, without being there, while being there. It's very curious. So the main thing is not be unwelcome - because it is very clear, one is not elected. The positioning is not simple."" During official visits, she follows directions: ""There is a small label on the ground, so I stand where I'm told to stand."" But whenever she can, she says she manages to escape on short occasions without Mr Macron and do things outside of the official programme. ""I always manage to. I always play truant."" Unusual couple The couple, who famously has an age gap of 24 years between them (he is 40 and she has just turned 65), describes themselves as an unusual one. They have a similar gap as that between Donald and Melania Trump - but the other way round. The Macrons met when Brigitte was Emmanuel's drama teacher in secondary school. Brigitte, who was married at the time, says she was ""totally overcome"" with his intelligence - Emmanuel was 15 then. Later, when Mr Macron ran for high office, his wife was credited with influencing his views on women in politics. But for now, her role remains a mainly ceremonial one.","Brigitte Macron has been shedding a little light on what life at the top is like as France's first lady, nearly a year after husband Emmanuel Macron was elected as France's president."
"By Hannah RichardsonEducation and social affairs reporter The most disadvantaged pupils will have access to tutors through a £350m programme over the year from September. Primary and secondary schools will be given £650m to spend on one-to-one or group tuition for any pupils they think need it. Head teachers welcomed the funds, but said more details were needed. Labour said ministers should convene a taskforce - involving trade unions and scientific and health experts - to help all pupils return to school safely as soon as possible. Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the plans ""lack detail and appear to be a tiny fraction of the support"" needed and called for a ""detailed national education plan to get children's education and health back on track"". However, Boris Johnson said the fund would help head teachers provide what pupils need. He thanked teachers, childcare workers and support staff for their efforts during the pandemic, and said he was ""determined to do everything"" he could to get all children back in school from September. ""We will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible,"" he said. And during a visit to a school on Friday, Mr Johnson suggested there may be change in the rules on social distancing, with more guidance due ""very, very shortly"", adding: ""Watch this space."" It comes as the Covid-19 alert level has been downgraded, bringing with it a possible relaxation of the rules that have kept many pupils out of school. The Scottish Government said it is also looking at social distancing rules in schools, after Northern Ireland decided to reduce its two-metre rule to one metre. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wanted schools to open safely as soon as possible. The announcement comes a week after Mr Johnson said the government was planning ""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"". But the announcement did not include any specific push towards catch-up activities running through the summer break except a expectation that usual summer clubs would be running. Instead there is a strong push for head teachers to target catch-up help via tutoring from September. However, schools minister Nick Gibb told the BBC there was lee-way for heads to set up summer schemes if they so wished. But he said: ""If you want children to catch up, it can't just be done over the month of August - it has to be longer term over the academic year"". Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the £650m pot represents about £80 extra for each student. That is a rise of about 1% but would leave total spending still 3% below 2010 levels in real terms. 'Unjustifiable' Early years providers and colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds are not included in the plans. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said it would be ""entirely unjustifiable"" to exclude sixth form students from the package. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the government's decision not to include pre-schoolers ""beggars belief"". But Mr Gibb said that older age groups had ""fared better with remote education than other age groups"" which is why the government was focused on helping younger pupils. Schools were shut across the UK on 20 March. Apart from the children of key workers, most children have not been to school since then and will not enter a classroom until after the summer holidays. Children in nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 have begun returning to primary schools in England, and some Year 10 and 12 pupils returned to secondary schools and colleges this week. Schools in Wales are reopening at the end of June, with only a third of pupils in class at any time, while in Scotland, schools are preparing to reopen on 11 August. Social distancing in schools has been halved to 1m (just over 3ft) in Northern Ireland, where ministers are aiming for a full reopening of schools on 24 August. However, head teachers have warned that parts of the Northern Ireland plan are ""unrealistic and undeliverable"". Plans for the subsidised National Tutoring Programme have been developed with a group of social mobility organisations and academics led by the charity Education Endowment Fund (EEF). The EEF has said that until now, access to tutoring has been the preserve of wealthy families - but this would no longer be the case as schools would be able to seek subsidised tutoring. However, individual schools would be expected to pay 25% of the tutoring costs in the first year, or from their share of the £650m in extra funding being made available to them as part of this package. The tutors themselves will be provided by organisations approved by the National Tutoring Programme. Many of them will be students or graduates trained by tutoring groups. Their modelling suggests between 550,000 and 650,000 courses, featuring three pupils to one tutor, would run for an hour a week over 15 weeks. ""Tutoring is the catch-up approach supported by the strongest evidence,"" said the EEF's chief executive, Prof Becky Francis. She said the programme hoped to reach more than a million pupils, calling it a tremendous opportunity to create long-lasting change. 'Long-term response' Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton welcomed the investment, saying it would help support the work schools are already undertaking on pupil catch-up. But he noted that the investment was expected to be spent on tutoring, rather than being left to head teachers to decide. ""As ever, we suspect the devil will be in the detail and we await further information,"" he said. He was also concerned that there was no investment for sixth forms. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, criticised the decision not to include colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds in the plans. He said teenage college students deserved as much catch-up support as every other age group and it was ""indefensible"" to overlook them. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said he was pleased ministers had listened to calls for a longer-term response, rather than short-term fixes. ""This is a considerable sum of money,"" said Mr Whiteman, but he also warned there were many details still to be worked through.

"By Jennifer ScottBBC News ""I know it might not be the best option for everyone,"" Charlotte told the Daily Mail. ""But for us it was so important to be able to have that family time and just properly cuddle our little girl."" For the Szakacs family, that option was a cuddle cot, enabling them to stay together for a longer period after Evelyn's death. The cots are refrigerated Moses baskets that create a cool environment for the child's body. By using it, Charlotte and Attila were able to stay in Martin House Children's Hospice, near Leeds, for 12 days, spending that time holding Evelyn, dressing her and even taking her for walks in a pram. The couple then made the choice to take their baby home for another four days, before holding a funeral. ""I think having the time with her made such a difference,"" added Charlotte. ""Being able to do so many of the things you imagine like taking her out in her pram, it really helped emotionally."" Creating memories Although hospitals and hospices only began using them around five years ago, the cots have already made big impact on bereaved families. ""It helps them to create memories,"" says Dr Michelle Hills, consultant in paediatric palliative medicine at Martin House. ""Some families want to push their baby in the pram they have bought, take them home to the nursery they have prepared. For some, it helps them in the bereavement process."" Medical staff also offer parents the option of taking pictures of their baby, footprints and handprints, and creating memory boxes. Getting these mementoes of their child can be important for some families to help them with the grieving process. And for some parents, taking their child home after they die is another method of helping them to cope with their grief. Where you can find help if you lose your baby But it is not one size fits all when it comes to something as traumatic as losing a child. Dr Hills says the 16 days Charlotte and Attila decided to have was one of the longer periods she had come across, but the decision was up to each individual family. ""The important thing is there are choices available,"" she says. ""Some people couldn't imagine taking their child home, some people want to stay in hospital, others want to use a hospice. ""It is absolutely devastating losing a child. We are there to help them with everything, from creating those memories to organising a funeral."" According to stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, 15 babies die every day either before, during or shortly after birth. ""That is 15 families all affected by that every single day,"" says Erica Stewart, bereavement support and awareness specialist for the charity. ""People don't realise it is that number and we need to address that."" The charity echoes the words of Dr Hills, saying what is important is that each family gets to choose how they want to proceed when a child dies. ""It is the approach staff take too,"" she says. ""If they approach a family, tell them something like a cuddle cot has helped others through that time, then it normalises it."" But in some cases, funding makes it more difficult. ""There is an issue as you could find two babies who die on the same day, but there is only one cuddle cot and only one family has that option,"" says Ms Stewart. ""We have seen a number of families who have used cuddle cots go out afterwards and fundraise to make sure more are available."" But whatever families decide on in the immediate aftermath of the loss, the pain does not stop there. Ms Stewart says: ""A lot of parents feel isolated when they have lost a child and people are too worried to talk to them about it. ""They have not forgotten that child, it never goes away and we need to make sure we talk about it more. ""If you know someone who has lost their baby, drop them a text, give them a call, offer to do something for them like walk the dog or take their other kids to school. They will appreciate it.""

"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Last week, it was reported that a 19-year-old Dalit woman (the Dalits were once called ""Untouchables"") was allegedly gang raped and assaulted by a group of upper caste men in Uttar Pradesh state again. The news shone the spotlight again on the rampant sexual violence faced by India's 80 million Dalit women, who like their male counterparts languish at the bottom of India's unbending and harsh caste hierarchy. These women, who comprise about 16% of India's female population, face a ""triple burden"" of gender bias, caste discrimination and economic deprivation. ""The Dalit female belongs to the most oppressed group in the world,"" says Dr Suraj Yengde, author of Caste Matters. ""She is a victim of the cultures, structures and institutions of oppression, both externally and internally. This manifests in perpetual violence against Dalit women."" The aftermath of the recent rape and murder of a woman in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, allegedly by upper caste men, played out the way it usually does when a Dalit woman is attacked: police are slow to register a complaint; investigations are tardy; officials raise doubts there was a rape; there are insinuations it had nothing to do with caste; and authorities appear, perhaps, to be complicit in siding with the upper caste perpetrators of violence. Even some of the media, from newsrooms dominated by upper caste journalists, question why sexual violence should be linked to caste. In other words, the state and parts of society in India conspire to downplay or erase the links between sexual violence and the hierarchies of caste. After the alleged rape in Hathras last week, the government of Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by an upper caste politician belonging to the ruling BJP party, hastily cremated the victim in the middle of the night and briefly barred the media and opposition politicians from visiting the victim's village and family, prompting suspicions of a cover up. In an unprecedented move, the government hired a private public relations agency to push its narrative that this was not an incident of rape. Dalit women across swathes of rural India have been victims of sexual violence for as long as anyone can remember. In these regions, much of the land, resources and social power remain with the upper and middle castes. Despite a 1989 law to prevent atrocities against the community, there was no let-up in violence against Dalit women. They continue to be stalked, abused, molested, raped and murdered with impunity. Ten Dalit women were raped every day in India last year, according to official figures. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of cases of violence against women as well as the highest number of cases of sexual assault against girls. Three states - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan - report more than half of the cases of atrocities against the Dalits. In a 2006 study of 500 Dalit women in four states across India on the forms of violence they had faced, 54% had been physically assaulted; 46% had been sexually harassed; 43% had faced domestic violence; 23% had been raped; and 62% had been verbally abused. And Dalit women bear the brunt of violence of all castes, including their own. The Centre for Dalit Rights group examined 100 incidents of sexual violence against Dalit women and girls across 16 districts in India between 2004 and 2013. It found that 46% of the victims were aged below 18 and 85% were less than 30 years old. The perpetrators of the violence came from 36 different castes, including Dalit. One of the reasons why the Dalits - especially women - bear the brunt of the violence is because they have begun to speak up. The turning point in the history of violence against Dalit women in India was in 2006, when four members of a Dalit family - a woman, her 17-year-old daughter, and two sons - were brutally murdered by upper caste men after a protracted conflict over land. The incident in a remote village called Khairlanji in Maharashtra state began with the two women going to the police to file a complaint over a land dispute with upper castes in the village. ""This gruesome incident stirred the conscience of Dalits and highlighted their social suffering and discrimination,"" says historian Uma Chakravarti. The upper castes have been rattled by increasing assertion by Dalits and have been striking back. In the Hathras case last week, reports suggest the family of the victim had a two-decade long dispute with an upper caste family. Around the country, social transformations are sending Dalit girls to school and pushing Dalit women and feminist groups to make their voices heard. ""Like never before, a solid Dalit women leadership is articulating its own grievances and leading the struggle without anyone else's intervention,"" says Dr Yengde. Dalit women are fighting back. And the backlash appears to be more brutal than ever. ""Earlier the violence was invisible and unreported,"" says Manjula Pradeep, a leading Dalit rights activist. ""Now we have visibility. Now we are stronger and more assertive. Much of the violence now is to remind us of our boundaries."" Read more stories by Soutik Biswas","""We are victims of violence because we are poor, lower caste and women, so looked down upon by all,"" a Dalit woman told researcher Jayshree Mangubhai some years ago. ""There is no one to help or speak for us. We face more sexual violence because we don't have any power."""
"The body of Nikki Allan, who had been stabbed 37 times, was found in a then derelict building near her Sunderland home, in October 1992. Police say advanced testing has enabled the DNA of a male to be recovered from existing samples. Detectives now want men in the Wear Garth area, where Nikki lived, to come forward for DNA testing. A reward of up to £10,000 has also been offered for information leading to a conviction in the case. Nikki's father David, who has not spoken about the murder until now, said he needed ""to speak out"". ""I can't begin to describe how difficult life has been without my beautiful little girl,"" he said. ""I would never want anyone to suffer the heartache we have suffered as parents."" Mr Allan has provided a DNA sample and said he ""would beg anyone who knew Nikki or had any contact with her before she died"" to do the same. ""This isn't about accusing anyone of being a suspect - this is to eliminate you from police inquiries,"" he added. 'Oppressive methods' Det Insp Paul Waugh, who is leading the murder inquiry, said it was ""still very much an active case"". ""In order to ensure we are able to fully consider any new scientific findings we have been obtaining DNA samples from people who may have been in the area at the time. ""We strongly urge any members of Nikki's family, friends of the family or anyone who had any contact with Nikki prior to her death to come forward to be tested."" Two years after Nikki's death a neighbour, George Heron, was acquitted of murder. Although he confessed to the killing, his trial judge ruled police had used ""oppressive methods"" during questioning and he was found not guilty. Police said advancements in forensic science have now led to investigative leads not available at the time. But Nikki's mother, Sharon Henderson, said she remained angry over the way investigations have gone. ""It's been horrendous. Nikki's case could have been solved, over and over again,"" she said. ""There's been so many things missing in the case were I've had to go out and find out for myself. ""I've even had to go to court to get permission from a judge to say that I can investigate my own daughter's murder because I'm not happy the way it was getting investigated.""",Fresh DNA evidence has been recovered by detectives hunting the killer of a seven-year-old girl 25 years ago.
"By Alys DaviesBBC Cymru Lauren Buxton, 23, from Abersoch, Gwynedd, became homeless after being admitted to a mental health unit. Psychosis can cause someone to experience hallucinations and hear and see things that do not exist. The Welsh Government said it has developed early intervention for psychosis in its mental health plans. Ms Buxton became ill in 2019. She said: ""This voice would come into my head and say, 'you're hopeless, you haven't been to see your friends or your family for ages'. ""And then it would go on to say, 'you get that no-one wants you here don't you?' ""I came to the conclusion that the people that saw the best in me were trying to make me kill myself."" Following her diagnosis, she spent time in mental health units in Hergest, Bangor, Gwynedd and in Manchester. ""I was so far from my family and friends,"" she said. ""I didn't know the area and there was nothing to make me feel safe."" During this eight-month spell she lost her job as a support worker, and was then evicted from her house as she could not pay her rent. But she has since recovered and found a new home with the help of Cyfle Support Services. Jane Wilkinson from the charity, which helps find accommodation for vulnerable people, said: ""There aren't enough houses for young people, especially for those looking for houses on their own. People have to wait months. ""And if the person doesn't have good relations with their family, they usually don't have a guarantor for their house and they're too young to pass a credit check of their own. ""But Lauren's story should give others hope when we think back to where she was before. We're very proud of her and all the things she's got ahead of her."" The Welsh Government said: ""The importance of developing early intervention in psychosis services is highlighted in our together for mental health delivery plan 2019-2022. The delivery plan outlines work planned to further develop and embed best practice service models.""",A woman who had psychosis has said more support is needed after she lost her job and became homeless while dealing with the condition.
"Shahid Mohammed is accused of killing five children, their mother, uncle and grandmother in Huddersfield in 2002. The prosecution alleges Mr Mohammed, 37, carried out the fire attack with other men due to the family dispute. He denies eight counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. Mr Mohammed, of no fixed address, fled to Pakistan in 2003 and was extradited back to the UK sixteen years later, Leeds Crown Court previously heard. Giving evidence, Mr Mohammed told the jury he went with an older brother to meet with Saud Pervez, who was in a relationship with their teenage sister Shahida Younis. Under questioning from defence QC Abbaas Lakha, Mr Mohammed admitted assaulting Mr Pervez in late 2001 after an attempt to convince him to call off the relationship ""until a later time"". ""He wasn't interested in what we had to say, he said he was going to continue the relationship so I got angry,"" Mr Mohammed told the court. The eight members of the Christi family who died in the fire The jury heard his sister and Mr Pervez later fled to Newcastle, with Mr Mohammed and others driving up from Yorkshire armed with an imitation firearm, a hockey stick and other weapons to bring her back. Asked what the purpose of the journey was, he responded: ""To find my sister, to speak to her, find out if she'd been forced into anything and bring her back to speak to my parents."" After bringing her back, his sister told the family the pair had married in secret, the court heard. It is believed the target of the fire attack had been Mohammed Ateeq-Ur-Rehman, who died in the blaze in Osborne Road, Birkby, the court previously heard. The prosecution said Mr Ateeq, a friend of Mr Pervez, had allegedly been targeted because he had played an ""active part"" in maintaining the relationship between Mrs Younis and Mr Pervez. The jury previously heard the defendant and another man, Shaied Iqbal, had driven in the early hours of 12 May towards the property, allegedly carrying petrol bombs in the back of a Nissan Micra. In a 2003 trial, Iqbal was convicted of eight counts of murder, while Nazar Hussain and Shakiel Shazad were both found guilty of eight counts of manslaughter in relation to the fire.

"Landowner TW Logistics erected fencing at Mistley Quay in Essex over concerns people would fall in the water. Campaigners branded it an ""eyesore"" preventing full use by the public, and gained village green status so the fencing would be deemed an obstruction. TW Logistics' appeal against the status was dismissed by the Supreme Court. It heard the land looking out on to the Stour Estuary, near Manningtree, had been used by TW Logistics' port vehicles and for local residents' sports and pastimes for many years. The 1.8m (5ft 11in) high fencing was put up at the waterside in 2008 following concerns of enforcement action by the Health and Safety Executive. Campaigners argued the fencing spoilt the view and blocked off the estuary, particularly for artists, photographers, sailors and swimmers. Ian Tucker, a local resident, then applied to the county council for the quay to be registered as a village green, available to the public for recreational use. A public inquiry in 2015 found part of the land satisfied the criteria, having been used by a significant number of people for 20 years. The High Court dismissed an appeal by TW Logistics, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal. 'Give and take' In their ruling, Supreme Court judges Lord Sales and Lord Burrows said the phrase village green ""conjures up an image of the archetypal village green with its area of grass"" - but that this 'green' was a 200 sq m (2,153 sq ft) area of concrete in a working port, where HGVs are driven. They dismissed all the appellant's arguments, including that the company could be criminalised for using port vehicles on the green. TWL Logistics could continue its activities as before, provided it did not interfere with the right of the public to use the land, and some ""give and take"" was required on both sides, the ruling added. Speaking after the ruling, Mr Tucker described it as a ""momentous day"" and Simon Bullimore, chairman of Free the Quay campaign group, said the fence was ""finally established as an obstruction on the village green"". ""We hope that TW Logistics will talk to us about an environmentally and aesthetically acceptable form of safety barrier along the quay edge,"" he added. Essex County Council said it was pleased the ""unnecessary"" litigation appeared to have been brought to an end. TW Logistics has been approached for comment.

"Dusty was found by a neighbour in the village of Eggborough, North Yorkshire, covered in blood, unable to walk or stand on 7 January. She was taken to the vet where she was destroyed. RSPCA inspector Thomas Hutton said: ""Dusty was previously shot in the leg with an airgun, back in November, and the pellet removed by vets."" He added: ""Clearly someone in the area has deliberately targeted her, causing a great deal of suffering to Dusty not once but twice, and now her death."" The charity has appealed for information. Dusty's owner Kate Brown said: ""It's impossible to understand why someone would do something like this. I don't think I'll ever get my head around it. ""The way she died was awful. She was in a massive amount of pain and distress."" She added: ""I am fearful that this is not the end of it and until the person who did it is caught, our other cat and many other cats in the area are at significant risk.""",A three-year-old cat has been put down after being shot for a second time in three months.
"By Aled ap DafyddBBC Wales political correspondent Creating a National Assembly for Wales was a lifetime ambition for the majority of Plaid members and its inception marked an electoral zenith. Under the leadership of Dafydd Wigley, Plaid won its highest share of the constituency vote in any Wales-wide election - 28.4%. Victories in the Labour heartlands of Islwyn and Rhondda contributed to 17 seats. It proved to be an electoral high point. Events within and beyond the party's control affected Plaid's popularity. Amid rumours of a plot, Mr Wigley resigned and was replaced by Ieuan Wyn Jones. Meanwhile Labour's fortunes took an upward turn when Rhodri Morgan succeeded Alun Michael as first secretary, later taking the title first minister. Electoral disappointment was to follow for Plaid. They lost Ieuan Wyn Jones' former Westminster seat of Ynys Mon to Labour at the 2001 general election and the party's representation in the assembly dropped from 17 to 12 following the 2003 Welsh election, with the seats gained in the 1999 election falling again to Labour. Ieuan Wyn Jones resigned as Plaid leader, but was soon re-elected to power as leader of the party's assembly group. At the 2005 general election, Plaid lost Ceredigion to the Liberal Democrats and were reduced to three seats, their fewest at Westminster since 1992. Party in power With support on the wane, Plaid undertook a significant re-branding exercise a year later, opting to use ""Plaid"" as the party's name, although ""Plaid Cymru - the Party of Wales"" would remain the official title. The party's colours were changed to yellow from the traditional green and red, while the party logo was changed from the ""triban"" used since 1933 to a yellow Welsh poppy. The third assembly saw an upturn in fortunes with Plaid increasing its numbers from 12 to 15 at the 2007 election, regaining Llanelli and the newly created constituency of Aberconwy. Following weeks of negotiations involving all four parties, Plaid and Labour formed what became known as the ""One Wales"" government. Central to the agreement was a commitment to campaign for a 'Yes' vote in a referendum on full law-making powers for the assembly. Ieuan Wyn Jones became deputy first minister as one of four Plaid ministers around the cabinet table with one deputy minister. The 2011 assembly election saw Plaid lose three seats and its place in government, and was overtaken by the Tories as the second largest party. It led to wide-ranging changes which included streamlining the leadership team. Mr Jones stood down as leader and left the assembly altogether two years later, forcing a by-election in Ynys Mon which Plaid won with an increased majority. In March 2012 Plaid elected Leanne Wood as the new leader ahead of two other candidates, Elin Jones and Dafydd Elis-Thomas. The party's first female leader, she was also the first not-fluent in Welsh. In local, European and general elections which followed Ms Wood's victory, Plaid has failed to make a breakthrough. Leanne Wood has said Plaid could lead a minority Welsh Government after 5 May. For that to happen, the party will have to nearly double its number of assembly members.","Plaid, Plaid Cymru, the Party of Wales. It has had several reincarnations reflecting a journey from a group of fervent Welsh-speaking radicals to a party which has shared the levers of power in Cardiff Bay."
"By Rob EnglandBBC News The Office for National Statistics said road transport drivers had ""some of the highest rates of death"" involving coronavirus of any working group. Forty two London transport staff, including 12 bus workers, have died after contracting Covid-19. People in England are being encouraged to return to work if they cannot work at home, but avoid public transport. 'Passengers can't socially distance' Jeffrey Reiling, a bus driver from Consett in County Durham, said it could be ""chaos"" as more people start using public transport. ""People being advised to wear masks isn't going to do it,"" he said. ""People need to be told you need to wear masks otherwise the virus will spread. ""On my buses, passengers can't socially distance from the driver because they need to get on the bus and get a ticket, that's where the entrance is. ""I've been told by my company that I can't refuse people travelling. It makes social distancing very difficult. ""We are very concerned with our safety."" 'I can't afford to go off sick' Ted, not his real name, who drives buses in Greater Manchester, said services had been ""getting busier"" over the past two weeks. He said: ""I've got a bottle of hand sanitiser, the vent holes and assault screen have been covered up. But apart from that, that's it. ""I feel lucky that I have a job but I also feel quite scared. I put in to be furloughed but I was refused. I can't afford to go off sick."" Although his bus has signs warning people to socially distance, Ted says they are largely ignored. ""The sign tells people to stay seated until the bus stops but they press the bell and walk up to the cab and are stood right beside me,"" he said. ""They get really angry when I tell them they are encroaching my space."" 'Potential job losses' Trevor Tubb, from Aylesbury, Bucks, who drives buses outside of London, said he was concerned over potential job cuts. Mr Tubb said the drop in passenger numbers could make many services not financially viable in the short-term. ""A double decker bus can carry up to anywhere from 80/90 passengers, but based on the social distance measures... to carry the same amount a bus company would be required to have six times the amount of buses for just one journey."" Mr Tubb said without government support, he was concerned ""job cuts would be made"". 'Drivers are worried' London bus driver Johnie MeHarry is a senior shop steward for his branch of the Unite union. ""Drivers are worried it's going to be overcrowded,"" the father-of-two, 39, said. ""It's already happening on a lot of routes. ""The more people there is on the bus, the more risk there is of contamination. ""What we are calling for is a fully-sealed-off cab."" Mr MeHarry said central London routes had been quiet during the lockdown, though he expects that to change over the coming weeks. The government has published separate guidance for passengers and operators of public transport. However, it has also recommended people look at using other ways to get around, such as cycling, walking or driving. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The prime minister has been clear that people should only go to work if they cannot work from home, and should avoid public transport if possible. ""We are working with local authorities and transport operators, including TfL, to reduce pressure on the public transport network so passengers have space to maintain social distancing where possible.""",Bus drivers have expressed concerns over their safety as lockdown measures ease and passenger numbers rise.
"Robert Hibbert used wealth earned from Jamaican plantations to endow a Luton charity for poor widows, which is now in the town's Hibbert Street. Luton Borough Council leader Hazel Simmons said the name was tainted by ""the darkness of the past"". The council cannot legally change the name without first consulting the street's residents. Ms Simmons said: ""When we lit up the town hall a few weeks ago in support of the Black Lives Matter movement we made a commitment to the community to demonstrate this through actions, not just words."" Mr Hibbert worked in his family's merchant house in Jamaica for 11 years, trading in slave-produced goods, before returning to the UK in 1803. He bought an estate in Bedfordshire and in 1819 paid for 12 cottages in Luton for 24 ""poor widows or other persons"". These were later demolished and rebuilt as almshouses in the road now called Hibbert Street. 'Harsh treatment' The council said that even for the time the conditions on his Jamaica property were considered ""particularly inhumane"". Evidence of their harsh treatment was gathered by a Unitarian minister sent by Mr Hibbert in 1817 to bring Christianity to his slaves. The minister's testimony was used in publications by campaigners who opposed slavery. The University of London's Legacies of British Slave-ownership database reveals Mr Hibbert received £16,000 to compensate him for no longer owning 852 men, women and children when slavery in the British Empire was abolished by Parliament in 1833. This is worth about £2m today. The council said it would start the process of consulting Hibbert Street residents about the proposed change of name in the next few weeks.","A street named after a ""particularly inhumane"" 19th Century slave owner should be renamed, a council has said."

"Qatar Holdings said in a statement that it would vote in favour of the merger next week. The shareholder vote follows after Glencore increased how much it would pay for each Xstrata share. The merger plan was first announced in February. Analysts said the deal between the two Anglo-Swiss companies would now likely be backed by Xstrata shareholders. While Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of Gulf state Qatar, has said it will vote in favour of the merger, it added that it would abstain on a controversial linked vote on whether Xstrata's board members should receive multi-million pound payments to stay with the future merged company. Several other Xstrata shareholders, including Standard Life, have criticised the planned payments. The merger would still need competition approval by the European Commission. To help secure this, there are unconfirmed reports that Glencore has offered to sell part of Xstrata's German operations.",The planned merger of commodities trader Glencore and mining group Xstrata has moved a step closer after Xstrata's second-largest shareholder said it would back the deal.
"In footage published by the Yorkshire Post, Mr Williamson, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told activists Labour was being ""demonised as a racist, bigoted party"". Deputy leader Tom Watson said he had been ""deliberately inflammatory"". The BBC has approached Mr Williamson and the Labour Party for comment. Labour has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism - hostility or prejudice directed against Jewish people - within its ranks. Nine MPs quit the party last week, criticising the leadership's handling of the issue. One of them, Luciana Berger tweeted in response to the Williamson video, saying: ""This is what I have left behind. It's toxic. Our country deserves so much better."" At an event in Sheffield last week - organised by grassroots Corbyn-supporting campaign group Momentum - MP for Derby North Mr Williamson said: ""The party that has done more to stand up to racism is now being demonised as a racist, bigoted party. ""I have got to say I think our party's response has been partly responsible for that because in my opinion… we have backed off far too much, we have given too much ground, we have been too apologetic."" Amid applause from the audience, he went on to say: ""We've done more to address the scourge of anti-Semitism than any political party."" Momentum has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. On Tuesday, Labour officials criticised Mr Williamson for booking a room in Parliament for a screening of a film about anti-Semitism and the activist Jackie Walker. Ms Walker was suspended by Labour over allegedly anti-Semitic comments in 2016, and the documentary, Witch Hunt, looks at those and other allegations within the party. A Labour spokesman said: ""It's completely inappropriate to book a room for an event about an individual who is suspended from the party and subject to ongoing disciplinary procedures. ""This falls below the standards we expect of MPs."" Stephen Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, said Mr Williamson's comments in the video were ""unacceptable"" and had ""no place in our party"". Mr Doughty added: ""I have made clear to both the Leader's office and our whips that I expect urgent action to be taken."" Wes Streeting, Ilford North MP, commented on the Yorkshire Post's video too, saying: ""Stomach-turning. No action will be taken."" And his colleague Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, also expressed her unhappiness. Another, Neil Coyle, called on Momentum and the Labour Party to do something, saying ""Actions speak louder than words."" Earlier this month, the Labour Party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, said the party had received 673 complaints in 10 months alleging acts of anti-Semitism by its members.","Labour MPs have criticised their colleague Chris Williamson for saying the party has been ""too apologetic"" over anti-Semitism."
"Here two residents recall what Idlib was like as a place to live when Syria was at peace. Saad Before the revolution, Idlib was famous for olive trees and olive oil - lots of Syrian provinces got their olive oil from Idlib. Citizens here used to work in agriculture and in planting olive trees. They would pickle olives and sell them locally and to Arab states such as Iraq. We also had lots of people who made carpets, glass and other handcrafts. The city was famous for the ruins of [the ancient city of] Ebla in the east. Tourists and archaeologists from all over the world visited them. We remember our schools and our friends who have died or emigrated. Every person here still has some of their old friends but most memories have been destroyed by the war and we have lost a lot of dear people. A lot of things have changed for us. The biggest difference is in the state of our lives. We only have electricity for about three hours a day now. We live on generators which provide power. There is a lack of water and there is no cleanliness or rubbish disposal. The streets are always dirty and there are no street lights. We miss hanging out at night, being able to walk in a well-lit street and spend the whole night there with friends, laughing and eating. We can't do any of this anymore. The moment the revolution started [in 2011], I knew that things would change in the country, but I didn't expect it to change for the worse. Idlib has lost its people, lost the children playing outside, the families that lived here for generations. A lot of people came here to escape other parts of the country where there was fighting, but the city misses its sons and daughters who were born and bred here. Salwa One of the most memorable moments for me growing up in Idlib was when former President Hafez al-Assad came to power [in 1971] and visited Idlib. He was attacked by people who threw tomatoes at him. In retribution, the city was excluded from many things such as infrastructure projects, social development and even political participation. We were never able to speak about politics. Elders used to tell us to shut up and that politics was not our business, every time we tried to voice our concerns. During school, we were forced to join the Baath [ruling party] scouts. We could not refuse, we had to do this, everyone had to. They used to treat us as if we were an army. We were punished for every mistake. It might have been good to make us stricter and tougher in life, but in my opinion the negatives outweighed the benefits. Idlib was one of the first cities to start the revolution. Most of the city's people are known for their opposition to [President Bashar al-] Assad and that's why we were scared. We all know how Idlib's people welcomed his father. At the beginning of the revolution, I lived in Aleppo and I watched on TV what was happening. There were a lot of images which portrayed the rebels as criminals. But when I came into the city, I saw that those were lies from the government media. Therefore, I started to become an activist but without revealing it to anyone. In 2012, there were attacks on the area where I was living in in Aleppo, so I moved back to Idlib and then I started to participate more in the activities. When the rebels took over the city, my participation in the revolution became public. Idlib has changed between my childhood and now. Now we are free, before we lived in fear and said ""the walls have ears"". We used to be afraid to speak and now there is more expression and freedom. Even though we are subjected to death, air strikes and murder, the revolution still lives with us. I have changed dramatically since the revolution. I know all about politics. We used to only study about the Baath party and its rule, but now I know about elections, about running in elections, the duties of the president, democracy. I don't have any pictures or anything left of my younger days and this is because I took them with me to Aleppo and I had to flee from the war and couldn't bring them back with me to Idlib. This hurts so much. What hurts me most is that I didn't expect not to be able to go back. I had pictures of my kids and my husband, and I will never get any of them back. Interviews by Abd Alkader Habak, BBC.",The last rebel-held province in Syria - Idlib - has been devastated by years of war and the displacement of millions of people.
"By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter, BBC News Like Tintin, Les Schtroumpfs, to give them their original name, have been part of Belgian cultural consciousness since the comic artist Peyo created them in 1958. Over the past half century, they have become a global brand with books, a song that topped the charts in 16 countries, a Hanna Barbera cartoon that ran for a decade and now, the beginnings of a Hollywood franchise. The first movie, starring Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria as ""real life"" characters alongside the animated Smurfs, was set in New York. So why, in the Europe-set follow-up, have they decamped so tantalisingly close to home - but in a completely different country? ""We feel that by going somewhere that speaks French, we are going back to the language roots of The Smurfs at least,"" explains producer Jordan Kerner. ""But by setting it in Paris, we are getting global landmarks that we can't really get elsewhere. The Eiffel Tower, the Opera House - these are all amazing places for the Smurfs to run amok. And the Parisians have been so incredibly kind to us that we achieved a film first - no other crew has had such good access to the city's landmarks in their history."" Much is riding on the success of the sequel after the first movie, released in 2011, was, as the Smurfs themselves would say, a smurfing success. It made more than half a billion dollars at the box office alone, excluding DVD sales. ""I was incredibly surprised that it took so well,"" confesses Neil Patrick Harris. ""I knew that it had ebbed and flowed in popularity since the TV series in the 1980s and, of course, a whole generation of children had never heard of them. ""But then it didn't fall out of the top spot after three weekends in cinemas, and that happens once in a blue moon. Pardon the pun."" ""I think wherever you live, you think the Smurfs belong to you,"" adds Jordan Kerner. ""So if you're in the USA, you think the Smurfs are American. They may be true blue Belgians in their hearts, but everyone thinks they have a share in them. And they're very, very endearing to small children everywhere."" The plot centres on the story of Smurfette, and how she came to be the only girl in Smurf village. Singer Katy Perry voices the female Smurf, providing her first lead role in a film. However, Perry was, according to Kerner, chosen ""completely anonymously from a range of voices we were asked to listen to"". ""They work very hard to make sure we don't know who they are - trust me, we wouldn't know Meryl Streep if she turned up in the mix - so we do pick with more than popularity in mind, and Katy has this visceral, male, raspy quality in her voice. ""We don't want Smurfette to sound too sugary sweet as she has that kind of personality anyway."" Perry insists she is not interested in furthering her acting career ""as there's too many singers out there who think they can act, and too many actors who think they can sing - it doesn't always work that way"" . Surprisingly, it is not Perry who provides the soundtrack for the movie. Instead fellow pop star Britney Spears has recorded the title track, Ooh La La. If it all sounds light years away from the innocence of Father Abraham's 1978 hit Smurf Song, Kerner insists the family of the creator, Peyo, who died in 1992, approves of any changes. ""We talk to his wife and family at least two or three times a week during shooting,"" he says. ""We are very keen to keep its roots and honour the original traditions of the Smurfs. But they appreciate that we have to move with the times in other ways, to make it relevant to our audience."" However, when it comes to filming the Smurfs, Neil Patrick Harris adds, it's still done using the traditional methods of storyboarding, followed by markers on set to denote where a Smurf would be standing in a scene. The animation is added in later. ""It took a long time to feel comfortable with this,"" he admits. ""I used to embarrass myself wildly to begin with, looking in the wrong place. It helps that the markers now have little LED lights on them all around, representing which Smurf is standing where. They light up according to which one is talking, so you know where to look. You'd be surprised just how much trial and error there is during a scene with me and five Smurfs."" Hank Azaria, who plays Gargamel, the wizard who wants to destroy the Smurfs, confesses to embarrassment of a different kind: the costume and make-up required to transform into what he describes as ""a preposterously evil wizard"". ""I mean, he's so bad, he's ludicrous. I was really nervous about the reaction to how I would look playing him. On the first day of shooting, in New York, I had to walk three blocks from make-up to the set in full costume. ""No-one in Manhattan batted an eyelid - apart from one dude, who just looked at me and said in passing 'Whassup, Gargamel?' ""The most feedback I have got from anyone is my four-year-old son, who asks me if I am going to be Gargamel today, he seems to think it's my job. I guess that's why you do it - for the children, and then if you can throw in a few laughs for the parents who've been taken along to watch it with them, that's a bonus."" Neil Patrick Harris agrees the secret to the Smurfs' popularity with children is their innate goodness, which he describes as ""timeless"". ""This movie will teach kids about a family - one that is chosen rather than one that is given to you at birth. When I think of all the broken families around me right now, and speaking as a man who has children with another man, it's a great note to affirm to a child. ""But no doubt about it, we have to use the word 'smurf' a lot. By the end of shooting, we can be smurfing sick of it."" However, he will almost certainly be repeating it in a third film, which is already being written, with an expected release date of 2015.

The Smurfs 2 is released in the UK on 31 July.","These beloved blue creatures are one of Belgium's biggest exports - but when it came to planning a sequel to The Smurfs, producers decided to set the new film an hour away from Brussels - in the French capital, Paris."
"By Cemlyn DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent Driving instructor and dad-of-three Andy Stonely is not eligible for the government's Covid support scheme. The Federation of Small Businesses Wales has also asked for changes ahead of the next round of grants. The Treasury said its Self-Employment Income Support Scheme was ""one of the most generous in the world"". This scheme requires claimants to show accounts for the 2018-19 year as well as 2019-20. However, Mr Stonely from Newport hasn't been self-employed for long enough to qualify - so the 35-year-old has had to rely on financial support from his parents. ""I count myself somewhat lucky because I have been able to claim for Universal Credit,"" he said. ""But obviously it's minimal and luckily through the help of parents I've been able to keep afloat. ""It's been tough. It would have been ideal if the government was just slightly more flexible."" Mr Stonely, who hasn't been able to work for much of the past year due to lockdown restrictions, said Universal Credit was worth ""less than half"" of his normal earnings. The coronavirus crisis forced his wife to give up her job to look after their three children, aged three, six and 17, when Mr Stonely was able to work for a short period at the end of the initial lockdown period. Asked how much longer his family could sustain itself if the current restrictions continue, Mr Stonely told the BBC's Politics Wales show: ""Not too much longer… we're going to be in a very tough situation."" Mr Stonely is part of a local driving school franchise managed by Gareth Denny, who said 11 of his 43 instructors were in this position. ""If you imagine that somebody lives their life to their income and suddenly there's absolutely no income to pay their mortgage and their bills, Universal Credit simply doesn't pay most people's mortgage,"" Mr Denny said. 'Struggling' Recent research commissioned by the Community and Prospect trade unions and the Federation of Small Businesses found 53% of self-employed people across the UK had lost more than 60% of their income since the pandemic began. In addition, 64% of people said they were now either ""unsure"" or ""less likely"" to want to be self-employed or freelance in the future. ""These are normal people who have mortgages, families to support, who've just had to fund a Christmas for the families,"" said Ben Francis of Federation of Small Businesses Wales. ""All those bills are now mounting up the other side of Christmas, and after having an already extremely difficult 12 months, they've now got to see how they manage through the months ahead. ""We would ask UK government to be flexible in their approach to verifying the statuses of these newly self-employed businesses."" The Community union warns with small businesses ""struggling to get back on their feet"", more people will leave self-employment. ""That will be a disaster for our economy, for local economies, for their livelihoods and their families,"" said Kate Dearden of Community. ""This section of the UK workforce plays a fundamental role and should be properly supported to continue to do so."" The Treasury has already committed to extending the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme until April 2021, although the eligibility criteria for the next round of grants is yet to be published. A spokesman said the scheme had ""helped more than 2.7 million people so far, claiming over £13.7bn"". He added: ""Funding is designed to target those who need it most and protect the taxpayer against fraud and abuse. ""Those not eligible may still be able to access our loans schemes, tax deferrals, mortgage holidays and business support grants.""","A father who has lived on Universal Credit since the Covid-19 pandemic started has called on the UK government to be ""more flexible"" with its support."

"Ahead of negotiations over the EU budget, Mr Miliband told the Sunday Telegraph Labour should not ignore the legitimate concerns of eurosceptics. But the UK needed to stay in the EU and push for reform to the budget, immigration and austerity measures. David Cameron is travelling to Brussels this week for the budget negotiations. In October Labour MPs joined Tory rebels to defeat the government on its strategy to push for a freeze in the budget, instead wanting Mr Cameron to push for a real-terms cut between 2014 and 2020. The prime minister has insisted a real-terms freeze is more realistic, but he has threatened to use the UK's veto if the rise proposed by the European Commission is not drastically reduced. Labour's decision to vote for an EU budget cut was seen as evidence that the party is repositioning itself on Europe towards a more eurosceptic position, but Mr Miliband insisted his party could be at once a keen supporter of EU membership and campaign for reform. 'Change is coming' Mr Miliband told the newspaper: ""Too often people have assumed that we have got to make the rise of euroscepticism about the mythology of bendy bananas and bans on chocolate, not the fact that the European budget looks like it's suited to the 1950s and not the 21st century. ""What I would say is - never shrink from being open about the problems of the European Union."" He would not commit to a future referendum on the UK's relationship with the EU, adding there were genuine concerns the UK could ""sleepwalk"" into exiting the group. The prime minister has been under pressure from his own MPs to promise an in/out referendum on the EU after the next general election in 2015. An opinion poll published in the Observer found more than half of British voters (56%) would vote to leave the EU if a referendum was held. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said his party could still be pro-European and argue for reform. 'Bring back powers' He said: ""We are very proud of Britain's role in Europe in recent decades and the fact we have seen peace and prosperity in a continent twice in the 20th century"" ""But it doesn't help the pro-European case to suggest the status quo does not need change - change is coming to Europe and that is why we will remain a pro-European, pro-reform party, taking a hard headed view of what Europe does well and what Europe does badly. ""Frankly we see the future as Britain being reforming in Europe, not exiting from Europe, and there is a growing number of Conservatives who believe the latter is the way forward."" He dismissed as ""nonsense"" a call by senior Tory MP David Davis for a double referendum - one to approve a list of powers for the UK to seek to seize back and then an in/out public poll. Mr Davis, a former Europe minister, said the first vote should be held within a year, before the next elections to the European Parliament in 2014. ""We have got to, somehow, dramatically change our relationship with Europe. Not a little bit of a power here and a little bit of a power there. We have got to bring back lots of powers,"" he said.","Labour should not shrink from ""being open about the problems"" of the EU and should back a ""hard-headed"" approach to reform, Ed Miliband has said."
"The Scottish Tory leader's office building in Roseburn Terrace was targeted at about 11:40 Ms Davidson, who is on maternity leave until next spring, was not in the building at the time.

"The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital opened in 2015, but fears were raised after deaths were linked to infections. An independent review concluded that some patients had been ""exposed to risk that could have been lower"". However, it found no ""sound"" evidence that there had been ""avoidable"" deaths. And the review team said the hospital campus now ""has in place the modern safety features and systems that we would expect"". A public inquiry is also to be held into issues at the Glasgow hospital and the long-delayed Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh, which has the same building contractor. Glasgow's £842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital has had issues with rare microbiological contaminants since opening, linked to issues with water quality and ventilation systems. Two people who died at the hospital were found to have contracted Cryptococcus fungal infection which can be linked to pigeon droppings. The 10-year-old boy and 73-year-old woman died at the Govan hospital campus, which is also home to the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC), in January 2019. A third death, involving a 63-year-old patient who contracted the fungal infection Mucor, was also investigated but no link was found. Ministers commissioned an independent review to establish whether the design, construction or maintenance of the hospital was having an ""adverse impact on the risk"" of infection. Dr Brian Montgomery and Dr Andrew Fraser wrote in their report that there had been a ""series of problems"" with the project. They said: ""Undoubtedly and with hindsight the health board, groups within it and the design and build contractor could have reached different decisions and produced results that would have reduced infection risk."" They said some patients had been ""exposed to risk that could have been lower if the correct design, build and commissioning had taken place"", and that certain elements of the design and build of the facility ""posed challenges"" for infection prevention and control. However, they concluded that they had ""not established a sound evidential basis for asserting that avoidable deaths have resulted from failures in the design, build, commissioning or maintenance"" of the campus. The report said that while pigeon droppings were found near an air inlet in the hospital, the patients who were affected by Cryptococcus did not spend much time in areas supplied by that part of the system. The authors said the presence of pigeons within the hospital was ""not sufficient to establish a strong association or causative link"" with the infections, and that the idea they were caused by ""contaminated air"" was ""not a sound theory on its own"". The report concluded that patients, staff and visitors can have confidence that the combined hospitals now have ""modern safety features and systems"" and offer ""a setting for high quality healthcare"". However Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said patients and families would be ""understandably concerned and distressed by some of the findings"" of the review. She said it was an important step in delivering answers to ""the many questions they are entitled to ask"". ""The report provides a wealth of information for the forthcoming public inquiry into the construction of the QEUH and the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh,"" she said. ""I would like to thank the review team for their diligence in carrying out this report and the hospital staff for their focus on providing high quality care throughout this challenging time."" 'Utterly damning' Ms Freeman told MSPs that the inquiry, which will be led by Lord Brodie, was ""on track to be formally launched in early August"". Scottish Conservative health spokesman Mile Briggs said the ""explosive report"" was an ""utterly damning verdict on the SNP government which planned, commissioned and built this hospital"". He added: ""It very clearly concludes that patients young and old with cancer - the same group from which people died - were placed at increased risk because of the building and design of the hospital. ""Patients and families want answers and the independent public inquiry which is to now proceed must be able to undertake that work and have full transparency and access to provide answers."" Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said there was ""still a lot of work to do to uncover the full truth"" about ""the scale of the scandal and the catastrophic errors which took place"". Drs Montgomery and Fraser said they had focused their review on ""potentially vulnerable patients and their families and the clinical teams, management and facilities staff who support their care"". They said: ""We judge that the hospital was not built, finished and handed over in a manner that took full account of their specific needs. ""Certain aspects of the design, build, commissioning and maintenance of the QEUH have posed challenges in creating the optimal conditions for infection prevention and control, and have increased the risk of healthcare associated infection."" They said the design of the hospital ""did not effectively reconcile conflicting aims of energy efficiency and meeting guidance standards for air quality"", and said there had been ""difficulties"" with the air and water systems due to ""ambiguity"" about guidance. 'Undermined by problems' They said the project ""would have benefitted from greater external expertise"" in decision-making at key points, and that the level of independent scrutiny of the commissioning, design and build phases was ""not sufficient"". And the doctors said the effectiveness of infection prevention and control was ""undermined by problems within the leadership team"" and internal relations within the health board's staff. The report said the ""series of problems"" with the project had had a ""multitude"" of knock-on effects, including: The authors made a total of 63 recommendations for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the hospital and its staff and the Scottish government, saying that ""lessons can be learned that will enhance confidence in future major projects"". And they said research should be carried out about air and water quality in clinical environments and the significance of ""rare microorganisms"" to inform planning in future.","A report has said there were a ""series of problems"" with the design and build of a Glasgow hospital campus - but no clear evidence to link those failures to any ""avoidable deaths""."
"The inaugural First Light Festival in Lowestoft, Suffolk was held in 2019 and attracted some 10,000 people. This year, the arts and music event was scheduled to run on 19-20 June. It is hoped national restrictions can be lifted on 21 June. Organisers said it had to be cancelled because there was ""a lot of risk attached to it"". Co-organiser Genevieve Christie said there was ""still a lot of uncertainty as we approach June"" and the team ""couldn't delay [the decision] any longer"". She added that they had many projects planned for the summer for all ages and the festival would ""come back all guns blazing in 2022"". The festival in Britain's most easterly town was co-created by designer Wayne Hemingway to help regenerate what Ms Christie called a ""neglected"" seaside town, and included films, readings, music, a community feast and a silent disco over the summer solstice weekend. It had been estimated that it generated up to £1.4m for the local economy and Mr Hemingway said it was hoped it might be a permanent fixture. ""It was wonderful and I think it will be again,"" Ms Christie said. ""Obviously everybody has to be very cautious so we're looking to next year to really come back with a festival that will be even better than it was."" She said the decision was also made to ""ensure the resilience of the organisation"". ""There is no insurance against Covid at the moment for events and so making that decision now actually enables us to be sustainable as we look to the future,"" she said. Meanwhile, organisers of the Southwold Arts Festival have also decided that the event planned for June will now not take place.

"The former chancellor introduced metro mayors in devolution plans for English regions while in government. He told a conference of northern business leaders mayors were now part of the ""national conversation"". But Mr Burnham has said England has ""devolution in name but not in reality"". The Labour former cabinet minister has been at war with Prime Minister Boris Johnson over financial support for his region, which culminated in the PM imposing tier three coronavirus restrictions. Later, in an interview with the BBC's Newscast, Mr Osborne warned Mr Johnson against being ""at war"" with the Treasury, following the latest round of financial support being announced. He told the prime minister to ""embrace"" his position as ""First Lord of the Treasury"" - the additional role held by the PM - adding: ""You know the prime minister who makes use of the Treasury, where you really do have a lot of policy-making capacity, is a prime minister who is going to be more powerful."" Mr Osborne, who among other roles now leads the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, called for more devolution during the Covid recovery. Speaking to the Great Northern Conference, he said he could see ""real representation in the North"". ""We now have a national political conversation where representatives of the north of England are heard on our national news. ""And that is a fantastic success story,"" he added, referring to coverage of Mr Burnham's clash with the government over financial support for Manchester. ""We need to be more courageous in giving many more powers to these local elected leaders,"" Mr Osborne said, as ""we're beginning to see a much more balanced, healthy British society and state where not every decision is taken at Westminster and other voices are heard."" ""But we've got much more to do."" But speaking at a parliamentary select committee meeting on Thursday, Mr Burnham said England had ""devolution in name but not in reality"". Mr Burnham rejected accusations he had been ""posturing"" during the failed negotiations with the government. He accused ministers of operating a ""divide and rule"" strategy, which he said was ""not the way to get a through a pandemic"" which has had a ""severe"" impact on his region. Mr Burnham was supported at the Commons business committee by Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region, who said that ""for far too long too many decisions have been taken with London centricity - not just the area of London, but the overall London culture that exists in Parliament"". Mr Rotheram was the first regional mayor to make an agreement with the government for his area to adopt tier three restrictions. Since 2017, eight English regions have appointed directly elected mayors. This means 12m people in England, over 20% of the population, now live in mayoral authority areas. Mayors have some powers over policy areas such as adult education and transport, but these vary from region to region. The eight new regional mayors operate under a different system to London, which elected its first mayor in 2000. The Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto committed to ""full devolution across England... so that every part of our country has the power to shape its own destiny,"" which is set include more metro mayors. The government was due to publish a white paper on the subject in 2020, but the Financial Times reported it had been delayed until next year. In a speech via video link to the Great Northern Conference, Mr Johnson reiterated the government's commitment to ""level up"" the North of England. ""Even now, as we are still up to our thighs in the mud of the trenches, grappling with this virus, my message to you is that it cannot be enough simply to get through the crisis. We must build back better, build back stronger, build back faster,"" he said. He added: ""That means our work to level up and unleash the talent and potential of the North - by investing in education, skills and infrastructure - is now more urgent than ever. ""We will move departments of state, ministers, private offices and all, to great Northern cities and regions that represent the future of this country.""","Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham's impact on the coronavirus debate demonstrates the success of the new Northern mayors, says George Osborne."
"Jobs Growth Wales has created more than 13,000 opportunities for 16 to 24-year-olds since it was launched in 2012. Ministers say 82% taken on by private firms move into apprenticeships, more learning or jobs. But the Conservatives said more needed to be done for job creation and entrepreneurship on a wider scale. Jobs Growth Wales aims to create 4,000 temporary job opportunities a year but latest figures show this target has already been beaten a year early. It covers the cost of a minimum wage salary and the employer's National Insurance contribution. Just under 10,000 of those 13,000 jobs have been filled but ministers say the gap is because the recruitment process is still ongoing. Ministers added the programme was ""clearly reaping huge rewards"" and £12.5m is to be spent in offering 4,000 more temporary jobs from 2015. Jobs Growth Wales First Minister Carwyn Jones, who is publishing the latest Programme for Government report, which tracks performance on key issues such as employment, health, education and communities, said the figures were ""outstanding"". Hydratech-Evans Coolants, who make specialist fluids and antifreezes in Swansea, have taken on 10 young people over the last two years - six have become apprentices, two have gone onto higher education and another two are still with the programme. Most had no skills when they arrived and the company said it had helped them with affordable recruitment and also build a sense of loyalty to the firm. Steve Hickson, managing director said it had been ""invaluable"". He added: ""We've been able to give local youngsters access to credible work experience where they have had a chance to learn, develop new skills and earn a wage."" William Graham AM, Conservative Shadow Minister for Business, said: ""While Jobs Growth Wales has created opportunities for some young people, it is disappointing that Labour ministers have failed to support job creation and entrepreneurship more generally by cutting business rates and red tape which are barriers to business start-ups. ""We need to start promoting entrepreneurship as a rewarding career in schools and empower people to make that a reality, making their own money, creating jobs and making Wales a more prosperous nation.""",The number of temporary jobs available to young people through a flagship scheme is higher than expected after a target was reached a year early.

"Anas Sarwar made the call after a mother accused NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) of covering up possible factors in her daughter's death. Mr Sarwar said the health board had tried to intimidate health service whistleblowers who had raised concerns. NHSGGC said the source of the child's infection could not be determined. Earlier this week a whistleblower revealed that a doctor-led review had identified 26 infections at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Children in 2017 which were potentially linked to problems with the water supply. Kimberly Darroch, whose daughter Milly Main died at the hospital in August 2017 while in remission from leukaemia, said health officials gave her no inkling that contaminated water could have been a factor. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said the first she knew of Milly's death was when Ms Darroch emailed her about her concerns in September. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has offered to meet the family to discuss their concerns - but said it was impossible to accurately determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement for water testing at the time. It said the hospital's water had been independently assessed as safe, and it criticised the whistleblower for causing ""stress and anxiety"" for Milly's parents when there was no evidence of a link. Anas Sarwar, however, insisted the health board had let down both patients and staff. He said: ""There was an attempted cover-up of Milly's death, and there are still dozens of families who don't know the truth about infections contracted in the QEUH. ""This only came to light following the brave actions of an NHS whistleblower. But rather than seek answers for patients and the public, the health board resorted to attacking the whistleblower, threatening and intimidating them."" The Labour MSP said Health Secretary Jeane Freeman only knew about Milly's death because she was contacted by her mother ""despite health chiefs at the board knowing since the doctor-led review earlier this year"". Ms Freeman has ordered a public inquiry into issues at the Glasgow ""super hospital"" site and Edinburgh's new children's hospital - but Mr Sarwar said more urgent action was needed. He said: ""The Scottish government must now step in and put the health board into special measures, so that ministers take control, staff can speak out in confidence they will not lose their jobs, and - most importantly - parents can learn the truth."" The £842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) opened in 2015 and the campus includes the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. Two cancer wards at the children's hospital were closed last year amid concern about infections, with patients decanted to the adult hospital. In January it emerged that two patients at the QEUH had died after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings. 'No way to know' NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said in a statement: ""We are sorry for any distress and anxiety being caused to families at this time. ""The truth is there is no way to know whether Milly's infection was linked to the water supply as we did not consider this to be the source at the time and we did not test for the particular infection in the water supply. ""A potential link between infections and the water supply only emerged the following year and this was confirmed earlier this year when Health Protection Scotland published their report on their investigations. ""We acted on this report and put in place extensive measures to improve the water supply, which is safe. ""We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have; it is really important that we base these answers on the facts."" A spokesman said they were working with Professor Craig White, who was appointed by the cabinet secretary to provide support for families. ""We always have to take care when discussing our patients not to breach their rights to confidentiality,"" she added. ""This can make it difficult to discuss in detail individual cases but we wish to make clear that we are taking these matters extremely seriously."" The health secretary intends to make a statement to Ms next week on the issue of infections at the hospital. She said: ""I have been clear with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that their approach to engagement with affected families had not been good enough, and they have sought to improve how they do this.""","Scotland's biggest health board should be put in ""special measures"" over its handling of hospital infection issues, according to an MSP."
"Stirling University principal Prof Gerry McCormac said the amount of time they spend in the classroom needs to be weighed up over a longer period. And he concluded teachers needed greater support to run before and after school activities. But the government-published review said there should be no change to teachers' working requirements. That would mean the current 35-hour working week remaining, as well as the amount of class contact time, set at 855 hours. But the McCormac review of teacher employment said the level of contact time should be considered over a greater period than is currently the case, such as across a month or a term. It also said teachers should be staying on school premises during the day. The report said: ""Evidence indicates that the significant majority of teachers are hard-working and dedicated to their profession. ""However the strict division of the 35 hours into blocks of time is seen by some as not being open for discussion. ""We received evidence, mostly from teachers in schools, of frustration at the inflexibility of a small minority of their colleagues. ""This has created the impression that some teachers opt out of their professional obligations."" Pay 'acceptable' The main recommendations of the McCormac review called for: Elsewhere, the review said teacher pay was at an ""acceptable level"" and did not currently need looking at. The government ordered the review 10 years after the the landmark McCrone agreement on teacher conditions. It was credited with improving teachers terms, but criticised for not focusing on boosting school standards. Issuing his findings, Prof McCormac, said: ""Our recommendations reinforce existing good practice. ""Our advice on contact time will increase flexibility in the teaching profession, and revitalising professional development will enhance teacher education, further improving the quality of teachers in Scotland."" Education Secretary Mike Russell broadly welcomed the report, and said its recommendations would be discussed with teaching unions, local authorities and others. He added: ""Some of this work will be through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers and some will be done separately and will build on partnerships already in play."" Ronnie Smith, general secretary of Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, said the McCormac review had come at a time when ""increasingly beleaguered"" teachers were having to sacrifice some conditions while facing a pensions raid and a pay freeze. He added: ""The initial overall impression is that the report weakens key contractual protections introduced in the 2001 agreement and strengthens managerialist, as opposed to collegiate, approaches. ""Under the guise of 'flexibility', even greater burdens and controls are proposed for teachers who will have to rely on the benevolence of the headteacher to spare them from excessive workload."" ""The proposals to reconfigure working time will not be well-received and, if implemented, would require a clock-watching approach that sits uncomfortably with enhanced professionalism."" Labour education spokesman Ken Macintosh MSP said some of the recommendations would ""drastically"" change teacher duties. ""With the number of teachers plummeting under the SNP, teachers are already under significant pressure - never mind piling more onto their plates,"" he said. ""Teachers should be left to teach, not dish out school dinners or repair computers. 'Plethora of rules' The report was given a warm welcome by Liz Smith, the Tory education spokeswoman, who warned the government not to ""cave in"" to union pressure. She said: ""I welcome the recommendations that there should be greater flexibility within individual schools when it comes to setting teachers' terms and conditions. ""It is clear that good teachers and well run schools don't need a plethora of rules and regulations - people will be very upset if unions use these findings to create trouble and disrupt the education of children all across Scotland."" Lib Dem education spokesman Liam McArthur added: ""Allowing greater flexibility between teaching time and non-contact time, for example, is potentially a helpful suggestion, but Scottish Liberal Democrats want to go further. ""Greater discretion should be given to head teachers in relation to staffing and managing their schools, to allow genuine excellence in education to flourish."" Isabel Hutton, who speaks on education issues for council group Cosla, said: ""Local authorities recognise the dedication and hard work of teachers, associated professionals and all those who interact with the wider set of services responsible for the education and welfare of our children, and I feel sure that councils will support all appropriate measures to advance professionalism and strengthen teaching in Scotland.""","Scotland's education system needs more flexibility so teachers can do their jobs better, a major review has said."
"He told Bishop Gerhard Mueller, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith - the Vatican watchdog that deals with sex abuse cases - to ensure that perpetrators were punished. It was the Argentine Pope's first public statement on clerical sex abuse. A leading sex abuse survivors' group has responded with scepticism, saying ""actions speak louder than words"". The new Pope was elected last month, replacing Pope Benedict, who became the first pope in 600 years to resign. When first elected, Benedict XVI promised to rid his Church of the ""filth"" of clerical sex abuse, but critics accused him of covering up abuse in the past and failing to protect children from paedophile priests. Victims of sex abuse by clergy had called for a strong response from the new pontiff to the crisis that has rocked the Church. 'Old vague pledges' In his remarks on Friday, Pope Francis said combating the crisis - which has mired the Church in scandal from the US, Ireland and Europe to Australia - was important for the credibility of the Church. A Vatican statement said the Pope had urged Bishop Mueller to ""act decisively as far as cases of sexual abuse are concerned, promoting, above all, measures to protect minors, help for those who have suffered such violence in the past (and) the necessary procedures against those who are guilty"". In 2011, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith called on bishops' conferences around the world to submit guidelines for helping victims; protecting children; selecting and training priests and other Church workers; dealing with accused priests; and collaborating with local authorities. Three-quarters of the 112 bishops' conferences have sent in such guidelines, with most of those yet to respond coming from Africa, the Vatican says. The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP) responded to the statement by calling for actions rather than words. ""We can't confuse words with actions,"" SNAP Outreach Director Barbara Dorris told the BBC. ""When we do, we hurt kids. ""We must insist on new tangible action that helps vulnerable children protect their bodies, not old vague pledges that help a widely-discredited institution protect its reputation.""","Pope Francis has called for ""decisive action"" in the fight against sex abuse of minors by priests."
"A gun salute at Edinburgh Castle marked the beginning and end of the national pause for reflection at 15:00. At Prince Philip's former school - Gordonstoun in Moray - pupils fell silent for three minutes in tribute. They also laid a wreath in the sea off Hopeman Harbour where he learned to sail as a boy. The duke died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April, aged 99. He was married to the Queen for 73 years. Prince Philip's long association with Scotland began with his schooldays in Moray and continued with family trips to Balmoral in Aberdeenshire every summer. A photograph shared by the Queen ahead of his funeral shows the couple smiling at the top of Coyles of Muick - a beauty spot close to the Scottish estate - in 2003. A series of remembrance events took place across Scotland to mark the day of the duke's funeral. Young sailors on board Gordonstoun school's 80ft training boat, Ocean Spirit of Moray, laid a wreath in a tribute that recognised his lifelong connection to the sea. On the shore, a lone student piper played whilst displaying the Duke of Edinburgh's coat of arms on a banner presented to the Gordonstoun pipe band by the Queen in 2019. In Aberdeen, a beach sand artist created a large sand picture in tribute to the duke while veterans gathered in remembrance. Elsewhere, the Royal Standard was raised at the peak of Ben Nevis by members of the Outward Bound Trust to mark the duke's support of the charity. The trust also raised flags at Snowdon in Wales, and Scafell Pike in the Lake District. In Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon observed the minute's silence at 15:00 on the steps of the first minister's official residence, Bute House. After the funeral Ms Sturgeon said: ""The many tributes paid to the Duke of Edinburgh in recent days have shown the depth of his contribution to public life over more than 70 years as well as his longstanding ties to Scotland. ""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for The Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as The Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Seven Scottish Cup fourth-round ties had been moved to avoid a clash with the funeral, including the Rangers v Celtic match which will now be held on Sunday. In horse racing, the Scottish Grand National at Ayr has also been delayed by 24 hours from its traditional Saturday slot. Meanwhile new pictures of the duke sailing a boat during his teenage years at Gordonstoun have been released. Philip was captured on camera in 1937 - when he would have been around 15 - at the helm of one of Gordonstoun's boats, a two-mast, 14-ton boat named Diligent. In another shot, he grins at the cameraman while helping with the washing up. Philip's time at the prestigious boarding school under the eye of his eccentric headmaster Dr Kurt Hahn, inspired him to start his Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. The images were taken by the great-uncle of a former pupil, who then contacted the school. On Friday, Gordonstoun pupils took part in an early-morning run by way of tribute to Philip. Morning runs were compulsory at the school until the 1990s and more than 100 students and staff, in household groups, ran a 3.5km route from Gordonstoun House to the nearby coastguard watchtower which Philip reopened in 1955. The watchtower replaced a wooden hut which the duke, a member of the ""Watchers"" - a precursor to the Coastguard - helped build in 1935. The Duke of Edinburgh's affinity with the north east of Scotland has also been highlighted by the minister of Crathie Kirk, the church used by the royal family when at Balmoral Castle. Rev Kenneth MacKenzie is the minister of the parish of Braemar and Crathie and domestic chaplain to the Queen, who visits the church for Sunday services with members of her family, when staying at the castle. He said: ""Over the last few days, many different tribes and nations have, with some justification, laid claim to the duke, and while I seek no argument with those who claim that he was 'thoroughly European', 'archetypically British', 'adopted by the Commonwealth', 'Baptised Orthodox', 'Confirmed Anglican' or whatever - let me try to set the record straight. ""I think HRH The Duke of Edinburgh was one of us."" Rev McKenzie added he was a ""man of faith with an active and enquiring mind"" and said he had a keen interest in the church a national and institutional level, including the decisions and discussions of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The minister recalled: ""He was never slow to question how this 'so-called faith' was being lived out in any given parish and community - and speaking for myself, I loved him for it.""",The Duke of Edinburgh has been remembered in a series of events across Scotland as his funeral took place at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.
"Mr Singh said his government would ""make all possible efforts to ensure security and safety to all women"". More than 100 people were hurt in clashes at the weekend - police say at least 60 officers were injured. The rape, which happened on a bus in Delhi and left the woman in a critical condition, has caused outrage in India. The government has tried to halt the rising anger by announcing a series of measures intended to make Delhi safer for women. These include more police night patrols, checks on bus drivers and their assistants and the banning of buses with tinted windows or curtains. But the protesters say the government's pledge to seek life sentences for the attackers is not enough - many are calling for the death penalty. Six people, including the bus driver, have already been arrested in connection with the incident. 'Justified anger' In a short televised address to the nation on Monday, Mr Singh said: ""I appeal to all concerned citizens to maintain peace and calm. I assure you we will make all possible efforts to ensure security and safety of women in this country."" Earlier on Sunday, Mr Singh said in a statement that he felt ""deeply sad at the turn of events leading to clashes between protesters and police forces"". ""We are all joined in our concern for the young woman who was the victim of a heinous crime in Delhi,"" he said. Mr Singh said there was ""genuine and justified anger and anguish at this ghastly incident"". The condition of the young woman continues to be critical, doctors say. She underwent surgery on Sunday to halt an infection and was put back on life support. On Sunday, riot police in Delhi used tear gas and batons to keep demonstrators, mainly college students, from marching on President Pranab Mukherjee's palace for a second day, despite a ban on protests. Violence erupted as demonstrators tried to break through police barricades to march on the palace. The 23-year-old victim and her friend had been to watch a film when they boarded the bus in the Munirka area intending to travel to Dwarka in south-west Delhi. Police said she was raped for nearly an hour, both she and her companion were beaten with iron rods and thrown out of the moving bus into a Delhi street.","Indian PM Manmohan Singh has appealed for calm in the capital, Delhi, following violent protests over the gang rape of a woman."
"Footage of the incident, which occurred in Ghaziabad in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, sparked outrage after it was widely shared online last week. In the video, posted on Instagram, one man can be seen beating and kicking the boy as a second person films it. Rights groups have expressed concern over an apparent rise in such assaults. In Uttar Pradesh, there has been an increase in recent years of reported targeted attacks on minorities, including Muslims, by ""extremist Hindu groups"", according to Human Rights Watch. Some Hindu temples in India do not permit entry to non-Hindus, and the site in Ghaziabad had a sign stating that it was ""forbidden"" for Muslims to enter, The Indian Express newspaper reported. Incident account disputed The incident involving the boy in Ghaziabad, named as Asif, reportedly took place last Thursday and was later posted online by one of the suspects, police said. It showed the teenager being struck in the head, forced to the ground and then repeatedly kicked, including in the groin. Asif's father - not named in the report - told The Indian Express that his son ""was in the area when he felt thirsty... he saw a tap at the temple and began drinking"". However, managers of the Hindu temple in Ghaziabad have questioned whether the incident was a dispute over water, stating that there was a tap outside and that Asif should not have entered the temple grounds. Ghaziabad police have named the suspect as Shringi Nandan Yadav, a resident of the city of Bhagalpur in the state of Bihar. They said he had told them that he was working as a caretaker at the temple where the alleged assault took place. Another man, named only as Shivanand, has been arrested in connection with the filming of the incident, police confirmed on Sunday. Ghaziabad police Supt Kalanidhi Naithani said the main suspect was arrested shortly after the incident was first reported, and that ""strict action"" would be taken. The reaction on social media was swift - and angry. ""What kind of sick person [do] you have to be to mercilessly assault a child?"" journalist Rifat Jawaid tweeted. Another Twitter user, local news reporter Navya Singh, wrote: ""This incident is not just brutal but also shows how brazenly the assaulter shared the video on social media."" Indian opposition politician Tejashwi Yadav tweeted that Asif was the victim of a ""poisonous ideology that teaches human beings not to be human"". The hashtag #SorryAsif has been trending on Twitter for much of the weekend.

"The body of a 41-year-old woman was found in bushes near her home in the city on Sunday, local police said. Relatives and friends later named the victim as Yelena Grigoryeva, Russian news website Fontanka reports. Ms Grigoryeva, who had reportedly received death threats, regularly campaigned for human rights in Russia. In a post on Facebook on Monday, activist Dinar Idrisov said his friend Ms Grigoryeva had been ""brutally killed near her home"". ""She had recently been the victim of violence and death threats,"" he wrote, adding that she had filed several complaints with the police. Police have not confirmed the reports of death threats and it is not clear if the attack was linked to her activism. A suspect has been detained in connection with her murder, according to Fontanka. Along with campaigning for LGBT rights, Ms Grigoryeva also demonstrated against Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, the ill treatment of prisoners and a number of other human rights causes. In January last year, Russian opposition activist Konstantin Sinitsyn, 53, was found dead near his home in St Petersburg after suffering head injuries. Police said the attack appeared to be a robbery. Last August, dozens of LGBT rights activists were arrested during a banned protest in St Petersburg to promote the rights of sexual minorities. In 2013, Russia passed legislation banning the spreading of what it described as gay propaganda.",A prominent LGBT rights campaigner has been found dead with multiple stab wounds and signs of strangulation in the Russian city of St Petersburg.
"Zeng Jinyan told the BBC there were now ""an extraordinary number"" of police outside the family's flat in Beijing. Mr Hu served a three-and-a-half-year sentence for inciting subversion. The charges related to five articles he had written as well as interviews with journalists in which he was critical of the Chinese authorities. Mr Hu has long been one of the most prominent critics of China's Communist Party, saying it ""presides over a system where torture and discrimination are supported by a sophisticated secret police"". The 37-year-old has also campaigned for people with Aids, and for the protection of the environment. 'Careful' In a brief online message Ms Zeng said the couple had ""limited freedom"", adding that ""right now, this is equivalent to house arrest"". The first picture of Mr Hu since his release, obtained by the BBC, shows the human rights activist inside his flat, pleased at being out of prison. Mr Hu is said to suffer from cirrhosis of the liver and was denied early release from prison for treatment. His wife told the BBC she was trying to arrange a hospital appointment for him but will have to apply for permission to leave their house to travel to see a doctor. She said: ""He will gradually integrate with the society again. He's a little slow right now, in all aspects (not just physical). He's not used to it yet. He needs a few days."" In a telephone conversation with a Hong Kong TV station, Mr Hu said his family is pressuring him not to resume his activism. ""They told me today to live an ordinary person's life, and not to clash with the system, because the system is very, very cruel - for example using a government's power to violate citizen's rights with no hesitation,"" he said. He said he could only say he would be careful. Mr Hu is believed to have been short-listed in the past as a candidate for the Nobel Prize. The president of the European Parliament, which has awarded Mr Hu its top human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, said it was important that Mr Hu and other Chinese activists should be allowed to carry on ""everyday life without further hindrance"". Last week, the outspoken artist Ai Weiwei was also freed. Mr Ai's detention in April prompted a global campaign for his release. The Chinese authorities say Mr Ai has confessed to tax evasion. The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing says it appears that Mr Hu, like Mr Ai, has been silenced, put under close surveillance and banned from talking to the media. About two dozen people in China have been seized this year and held at secret detention centres, including Ai Weiwei, several lawyers and activists, our correspondent says. Most of those released have refused to talk, apparently pressured or intimidated into staying silent. Some are still missing.","Chinese human rights activist Hu Jia, who was freed from jail on Sunday, is being held under conditions ""equivalent to house arrest"", his wife says."

He said: ""It is going to cost... we have to move on and play our part in terms of a sustainable planet."" A new waste strategy was presented to the island earlier in year, with an emphasis on recycling and reusing. It suggested that any residual waste may be exported to other jurisdictions for disposal.

"The county, under Sheffield City Region mayor Dan Jarvis, will have new powers and receive about £30m from Whitehall. Local Government Minister Simon Clarke said the deal would ""unlock real benefits for people across South Yorkshire"". Mr Jarvis said it would bring ""significant transformations"" across the county. He added: ""We have to make the most of the benefits devolution has to offer."" The order for the deal will be laid in Parliament after letters of agreement were submitted by the mayor and council leaders in Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The deal is set to be approved and then the devolved money will be available, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The mayor will have power over transport, strategic planning and skills in the region, plus £900m over 30 years. Mr Jarvis, who is also the MP for Barnsley Central, said: ""We must make sure we make the most of the benefits devolution has to offer. ""It's dragged on for far too long and we have a generational opportunity for us in South Yorkshire to make a success of it.""

"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter These are the new forecasts of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies for how a no-deal Brexit is likely to drench the UK's public finances in red ink. Only on the extraordinary scale of the fiscal collapse of the 2008 financial crisis are these numbers modest. On any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards £100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century. And all this comes at a time where the Institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits. The Treasury acknowledged its fiscal framework was under review ahead of a Budget due before the end of the year. In its Green Budget audit of Britain's, tax, spending and borrowing, the IFS calculates that the government's day-to-day spending plans for public services next year are now close to the levels suggested by Labour's manifesto at the last election in 2017. If there is an election, the fiscal framing of it will be rather different to the last few. The Conservatives might not be attacking Labour over public spending or not funding their commitments. Labour might be brandishing helpful macroeconomic forecasts from at least some big banks. These numbers hinge on assessments of the future path of the economy, should the UK leave the European Union with no deal. The difference between the two now plausible extreme scenarios is an economy over 4% smaller by 2022 under no deal, than if Brexit were to be revoked. A further delay to Brexit would leave the economy 2.5% bigger by 2022, while a smooth Brexit deal would be 3% bigger, according to the macroeconomic forecasts provided for the IFS by economists at the bank Citigroup. These researchers have gone further in calculating the path to remaining in the EU lying through a Labour-led Remain alliance government, that could not enact the most radical parts of the Corbynite domestic agenda, but could legislate for a referendum. In contrast, a no-deal outcome requires a post-election Conservative government. The end result, perhaps surprisingly, is that one of the world's largest banks forecasts a Labour-led Remain government, leading to an economy that is 4% larger than a no-deal Conservative government by 2022. If the Brexit issue can be parked, the IFS analysis points to some tricky long-term fiscal problems. Health and social care spending is now 42% of central government day-to-day spend, up from 26% two decades ago. It is heading to close to half, which requires tough decisions on the system or on higher taxes. But no progress has been made on this issue, and many like this, as parliamentary and Whitehall time and effort continues to be dominated by Brexit. In any scenario, it seems difficult to imagine how this will change.","A doubling in the annual budget deficit, leading in relation to the size of the economy, the highest government debt since the 1960s."
"Several new computers have been found carrying malware installed in the factory, suggests a Microsoft study. One virus called Nitol found by Microsoft steals personal details to help criminals plunder online bank accounts. Microsoft won permission from a US court to tackle the network of hijacked PCs made from Nitol-infected computers. Domain game In a report detailing its work to disrupt the Nitol botnet, Microsoft said the criminals behind the malicious program had exploited insecure supply chains to get viruses installed as PCs were being built. The viruses were discovered when Microsoft digital crime investigators bought 20 PCs, 10 desktops and 10 laptops from different cities in China. Four of the computers were infected with malicious programs even though they were fresh from the factory. Microsoft set up and ran Operation b70 to investigate and found that the four viruses were included in counterfeit software some Chinese PC makers were installing on computers. Nitol was the most pernicious of the viruses Microsoft caught because, as soon as the computer was turned on, it tried to contact the command and control system set up by Nitol's makers to steal data from infected machines. Further investigation revealed that the botnet behind Nitol was being run from a web domain that had been involved in cybercrime since 2008. Also on that domain were 70,000 separate sub-domains used by 500 separate strains of malware to fool victims or steal data. ""We found malware capable of remotely turning on an infected computer's microphone and video camera, potentially giving a cybercriminal eyes and ears into a victim's home or business,"" said Richard Boscovich, a lawyer in Microsoft's digital crimes unit in a blogpost. A US court has now given Microsoft permission to seize control of the web domain, 3322.org, which it claims is involved with the Nitol infections. This will allow it to filter out legitimate data and block traffic stolen by the viruses. Peng Yong, the Chinese owner of the 3322.org domain, told the AP news agency that he knew nothing about Microsoft's legal action and said his company had a ""zero tolerance"" attitude towards illegal activity on the domain. ""Our policy unequivocally opposes the use of any of our domain names for malicious purposes,"" Peng told AP. However, he added, the sheer number of users it had to police meant it could not be sure that all activity was legitimate. ""We currently have 2.85 million domain names and cannot exclude that individual users might be using domain names for malicious purposes,"" he said.",Cybercriminals have opened a new front in their battle to infect computers with malware - PC production lines.
"I first heard about egg donation when I was at university in the US. We studied the sociology, psychology and biology of sperm and egg donation, and I was really inspired by the gift-giving nature of it - I knew it was for me. The professor told us that egg banks wanted young, healthy women who were well-educated, but that there was a real shortage of women of colour. I thought about people like me - from a Chinese background - who might have fertility problems and want to have children really badly. I thought about my gay male friends who spoke at length about wanting to be good parents and how my gift could help them, too. The professor talked about how each egg could be worth up to $3,000 (£2,280) which made the lecture hall go: ""Ooooooh!"" I decided to give it a go and registered via a website decorated with pictures of cheerful, chubby babies. Unfortunately, I failed the screening process almost immediately - anyone who lived in the UK for more than six months from 1980 to 1997 is ineligible because of the possible risk of transmitting the human form of BSE (vCJD). This also meant I couldn't donate blood, or be put on the organ donor list. But the idea stayed with me, and when I came back to the UK for my postgraduate degree, I decided to try again here. One big difference is that donors here receive a one-off compensation fee of £750 ($990) to cover costs - but I wasn't doing it for the money. I registered through another website decorated with cute baby pictures and was invited to take part in a rigorous screening process. They asked me lots of questions - the administrator, the nurse, the doctor - everyone wanted to know why I wanted to donate my eggs. I boiled it down to: ""I want to make families feel complete."" I found out that in the UK there is also a shortage of donors from ethnic minorities. As far as I know, there's nothing in Chinese culture that prohibits egg or gamete donation, but it still took me ages to tell my mother that I wanted to do it. My mum has always insisted that if she were to die, she wanted to donate any organ that could be useful to people. Eggs though! That's a bit different, because people would be walking around with our genes. Would my parents think of them as their grandchildren? When I eventually told her, her immediate reaction was, ""Let's not tell your dad."" When I was approved as a donor, they explained that it wasn't like in the movies and that after the donation I really wouldn't get any news about possible offspring until they were adults - and then only if they asked the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority for information about their egg donor. I thought that seemed reasonable. I found myself thinking a lot about how I was presenting myself to the potential parents. On the forms I filled in my height, my weight, my eye colour and medical history, but that doesn't really capture me as a person. How would parents know if their kid might turn out to be sporty, fond of Thai food, kind to animals or like wearing black? The clinic did ask about my hobbies and whether I played a musical instrument, but it felt like I was writing a pretty dry CV, to be honest. Over the next few weeks I had lots of medical tests. I really hate having blood drawn so I always treated myself to a samosa afterwards - as a consequence, samosas now taste like cheering myself up. I had to inject myself with hormones twice a day, which was a bit like playing doctor. I kept the needles in our family fridge - nobody asked me what was in the strange-looking pack. The syringe worried my mother though, so she had to leave the room while I did it. Being on hormones was like having premenstrual syndrome, but 100 times worse - I was told that women ""experience cramps"" but I promise you, there was a lot more going on. I put on weight, I felt bloated. Jeans? Forget it - elasticated waists all the way. I got tearful easily over anything - pop songs, animal videos. The visits took up a lot of time, the appointments themselves were short but there were a lot of them - luckily I was only working part-time, and mostly in the evenings. The overall process took over three months. When I was close to donation - or ""extraction"", as it is sometimes known - I got a text from a nurse in the middle of the night. A terrorist attack had happened that evening near the clinic, and the entire area was taped off as a crime scene. None of the staff could get to work and the more urgent patients had to be diverted to a Harley Street clinic. I only had a few days to go, so they needed to rearrange my appointment as soon as possible. On the way to the clinic the next morning, I found myself thinking: ""If I'm killed in a terrorist attack, can it please be after I donate, because I've got these precious eggs in my tummy that need to go to families who are relying on me."" The importance of what I was doing hadn't quite sunk in until that moment. The Harley Street clinic was so plush that the waiting room had a mural. The magazines were proper fashion magazines and instead of having to crane my neck to look at the ultrasound, I could see it on a huge plasma screen on the wall. The technician counted my egg sacs. I'd got pretty good at counting them myself over the weeks. They decided I was ready and told me about the donation procedure, which involved fasting the night before. I had to come back early the next morning. I decided to dress up for the occasion because I didn't want to feel like a patient - plus, it was Harley Street! I was put in a waiting room and through the curtains I could hear a steady stream of women who were also there to donate. I couldn't see them, but when I heard someone refer to me as ""the Chinese lady"" I assumed the others weren't. I'd never been put under a general anaesthetic before, or even worn a hospital gown. The nurses were concerned for my modesty but I was taking selfies in the bathroom pretending it was a backless dress. Going into the theatre I put my legs in the stirrups and tried to peer around the operating theatre - I wanted to remember everything, but they counted me out and the next thing I knew, I was in a chair in the recovery room. The surgery had taken 15 minutes. I was quite drowsy, and slept on and off. A nurse came to ask if I wanted a biscuit - even in my half-conscious state I was a diva and asked her to bring me a selection. I got a box of chocolates and a ""Thank you for donating"" card. They told me they had taken 11 eggs in total - one short of a dozen. It would be cool if even one became a person. I was told to write a goodwill letter to the parents and potential offspring. It would be the only thing they got from the donor until any children were old enough to decide whether or not they wanted to contact me. I wrote a letter on my phone, as soon as I left the clinic. I suddenly got so emotional about all these hypothetical kids that I started to cry. I told them that they were the result of much planning and love, and that my family, my partner, my friends all cared about them - even though they don't know them. I also told them a bit more about me - about my passion for social justice and that I don't suffer fools gladly. I hope that in about 18 years' time I'll find out how it went. Would I do it again? Maybe. I do think I made the right decision and it wasn't as difficult as I had imagined.

"By Jack Goodman and Flora CarmichaelBBC Reality Check Many of the grievances expressed have been fuelled by false and misleading claims. We've investigated seven of the most frequently-shared examples. Claim: ""Here we are a year later - the world shut down for a 99.97% survival rate"" Verdict: This figure and similar figures being widely shared, are incorrect. One recent estimate shows that overall, on average, about 99.3% of people who catch coronavirus survive it, according to statistics analysed by University of Cambridge. That might not seem like a big difference, but it means that about 70 in 10,000 people are expected to die - not three in 10,000. The death rate is much higher for older and more vulnerable people. And many people across all age groups suffer serious long-term effects from the virus. About 10% of people still have symptoms 12 weeks or more after their positive test, according to an Office for National Statistics (ONS) study. (The symptoms are wide-ranging, including cough, loss of smell, fatigue and sore throat. The study is still a work in progress. And it's worth noting that some people may have dropped out, and that those with symptoms are more likely to report them.) Claim: Suicides increased ""200%"" during lockdown Verdict: The only reliable recent data available on suicides in England - from the University of Manchester - has found that rates have not risen during lockdown. Stay-at-home orders and the economic impact of the pandemic have undoubtedly taken a toll on people's mental health. However, shared posts saying suicides have gone up by 200% during the pandemic are false. Claim: Every winter hundreds a day die from respiratory diseases...""why are we locked down?"" Verdict: Flu, a serious respiratory virus can be deadly - but there are vaccines and treatments available. Only very recently have vaccines for Covid-19 started to be rolled out, and only now are more effective treatments available. The long-term effects of Covid can also be much more severe for many people and it's more infectious than flu. Covid is also deadlier, says Prof Andrew Pekosz, faculty director at Johns Hopkins University in the United States. ""Covid-19 has a higher severe disease and mortality rate than influenza in all age groups, except perhaps children under the age of 12."" The risk of serious illness and death from coronavirus is significantly higher for older age groups. Claim: ""Covid-19 death rates have been falsely inflated"" Verdict: More than 125,000 Covid deaths have been recorded in the UK so far. There are different ways of recording these deaths, but all broadly agree on the scale of the crisis. About 90% of the deaths where Covid appeared on the death certificate had the virus as the underlying cause attributed by a doctor, according to the ONS. The ONS total roughly matches up with Public Health England's count, which looks at anyone who died within 28 days after a positive test, as well as the number of excess deaths, which is measured against a five-year average. Almost all of these have been attributed to coronavirus, according to the UK's three national statistics agencies. Claim: ""No-lockdown Sweden fared better than the UK"" Verdict: It's true that Sweden has had a lower Covid death rate than the UK, but it has fared significantly worse than its neighbours, all of which had tighter initial lockdown restrictions. Many people opposed to Covid restrictions point to the example of Sweden, a country which at the beginning of the pandemic avoided introducing a compulsory lockdown, and instead issued voluntary distancing advice. However, Sweden is a very different country to the UK and has characteristics that may have helped it during the pandemic. It has a lower population density, and a high proportion of people live alone. The capital, Stockholm, is also less of an international transit hub than London. When compared to other Scandinavian countries with similar population profiles, Sweden has fared much worse and recorded a significantly higher number of deaths than its neighbours, all of which have had tougher restrictions during much of the pandemic. It is hard to separate all the factors that might have caused this, but the absence of strict lockdown measures is likely to have contributed. There's also no evidence that Sweden's economy did any better than its neighbours. Although Sweden chose not to lock down early in the pandemic, with bars, restaurants and shops remaining open, increasingly tighter legally-binding restrictions have been imposed over the last five months. These include a ban on public gatherings of eight or more people, limits on numbers in stores, gyms and on bookable public transport and a stop on serving food and drink after 20:00. Daily reported deaths have been falling since early January, but the infection rate remains high. Claim: ""There was no pressure on the NHS all winter"" Verdict: Hospitals were very busy, particularly over the winter months, but the NHS has been able to cope, largely because of restructuring and lockdown restrictions. The strain on critical-care beds has been acute, along with the specialist staffing required. The number of adults in critical care was far higher than previous winters. In the last week of January 2021, some 2,000 more critical care beds a day were occupied in England compared with the previous year. Some non-Covid-related care has been shelved temporarily, and wards have been restructured to ensure the virus doesn't spread, which inevitably means fewer beds are available. In some hospitals, overall occupancy rates might have appeared lower than expected, but there's been a big effort to ensure enough spare capacity to cope with surges in coronavirus cases. Coronavirus has also had a big impact on staffing, with large numbers off sick or self-isolating. Claim: ""With PCR, if you do it well you can find almost anything in anybody"" The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is considered the most reliable way to detect coronavirus. The process was invented in the 1990s, long before Covid appeared, by Californian scientist Kary Mullis. At a public event, he once said: ""With PCR, if you do it well you can find almost anything in anybody."" This has since been used to discredit PCR testing for Covid, but these criticisms are unfounded. Mr Mullis was referring to the high level of sensitivity of his test. PCR testing can pick up a tiny amount of virus, so it is possible for someone to get a positive result if they go for a test days or weeks after an infection and are not actually infectious any more. However, this is unlikely to have a significant effect on the number of cases, and people tend to have a test when they have symptoms.",Opposition to the UK lockdown has led to street protests and campaigns on social media.
"By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC Northern Ireland health correspondent Professor Chris Ham is one of five people appointed by the health minister Poots who will advise and challenge how services should be developed. Edwin Poots announced in June that experts would look into how health and social care could be changed. This could lead to fewer hospitals, but greater choice in community care. It is understood that he will use the panel's recommendations to decide how hospital's Accident and Emergency departments, GP services and other health care sectors could interconnect. It is not the first time there has been a review into health care in Northern Ireland and it probably will not be the last. But what's different about this one is that the man leading it is John Compton - not an outsider - but the chief executive of the local Health and Social Care Board. In his first interview after being appointed health minister in May, Mr Poots told the BBC that he was not adverse to making big changes and that he was the man for the job. When being filmed for the Hearts and Minds programme, he was seen reading the infamous McKinsey report. A hard-hitting consultancy document, commissioned by the Health and Social Care Board, which suggests cutting, charging and consolidating services. 'More efficient' The panel is impressive. Professor Ham, CBE, has been professor of health policy and management at the University of Birmingham since 1992. He is known to use research evidence to inform policy and management decisions in areas such as health care reform, chronic and primary care performance improvement and leadership. In the past 12 months his colleague at the King's Fund, Chief Economist John Appleby, carried out a rapid review of services here which cost around £45,500. That report recommended that services and especially staff could be more efficient. Also bringing his experience from England will be Dr Ian Rutter. A GP for over 20 years, his experience includes being chief executive of North Bradford Primary Care Trust. He was also a former clinical advisor in the policy and strategy directorate of the Department of Health. Local expertise includes Professor Deirdre Heenan, Provost and Dean of Academic development at the University of Ulster's Magee campus. The only woman on the review panel, Ms Heenan has made it no secret that she believes the local health service needs revamping. In previous interviews, she has told the BBC that she believes there are too many hospitals in Northern Ireland and there is no equality for people who live in rural areas. When contacted by the BBC over her latest appointment she said: ""This isn't rocket science. Basically we need to decide what type of health service we want and then decide how to deliver it. ""It will be difficult but not impossible. It's not a cost cutting exercise, we will be looking at how hospitals and health and social care services can better connect with each other and therefore provide a better service for the public. "" There may be some criticism that the man leading the review, John Compton, is in effect reviewing himself. But in the past, others criticised the likes of the Appleby report and the McKinsey review which involved professionals coming from England to advise local people how they should be organising local services The review panel is to consult with local health groups including the health unions. They have been asked to report their findings to the health minister by 30 November.","The chief executive of health charity the Kings Fund is to be part of the team to carry out a review of NI's health service, the BBC has learned."
"Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, collapsed and died while jogging near his home in Weybridge, Surrey, in November 2012. It was a few months after he applied for £8.5m of life insurance policies. Mr Perepilichnyy had been helping an investment firm uncover a £150m Russian money-laundering operation. Previous inquest evidence revealed he might have been poisoned. Mr Perepilichnyy's name was on a ""hit list"" in Moscow and he told London colleagues he had received death threats, the inquest has heard. Not 'warned off' Robert Moxon Browne, for insurer Legal and General, questioned Det Supt Ian Pollard on why he did not focus more attention on Russian criminal gangs. Mr Pollard told the court intelligence inquiries by Serious Organised Crime Agency, counter terrorism and Special Branch had uncovered nothing to suggest the businessman was at risk of harm. Mr Pollard confirmed he never spoke to William Browder, co-founder and chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, the investment firm investigating the money-laundering operation. He said he was not prepared to send officers to Russia as he did not want his investigation to go off at a ""tangent"", ""not because I was warned off or told not to pursue it"". He agreed when coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC commented: ""Anyone can get caught up in a conspiracy theory, wherever they come from, whoever is the subject of them."" The original post-mortem examination found no signs of ""third-party involvement or foul play"". After this, the contents of Mr Perepilichnyy's stomach were disposed of. A ""limited"" amount was recovered for a second autopsy, which failed to identify a cause of death. Subsequent toxicology tests from 2015 showed that a rare poison may have been used to kill him, but Mr Pollard said further tests at London's Kew Gardens drew a blank. The inquest continues.","A senior police officer did not pursue the possibility a businessman was killed by Russian gangs because he did not want the investigation going off on ""a tangent"", an inquest has heard."
"A member of the public spotted movement and opened it to reveal the royal pythons, the RSPCA said. They had been dumped next to a bin behind Farringdon Fire Station in Sunderland on Thursday night. One of the snakes later died. The others are being cared for by a vet and will be moved to a reptile facility later. An RSPCA spokesman said: ""It's quite unusual for someone to have this many pythons and to abandon them in what appears to be a child's pillowcase."" Animal collection officer David Dawson said: ""When I opened up the pillowcase, there was a bundle of snakes inside - it must have been a very strange discovery for the people who found them. ""They were abandoned and left in extremely cold conditions. Reptiles like snakes are completely dependent on their owners, who need to provide them with the correct environment, including heating and lighting, so abandoning them like this leaves them very vulnerable.""

"Robert PestonEconomics editor We've seen that with the imposition of a higher minimum wage, rebranded as his National Living Wage, and his stumbling attempt to cut state top-ups to the low paid through the tax-credit system. We are seeing it today with what one of his colleagues describes as the government ""raising the affordable housing budget but also redirecting it to homes for sale rather than rent"". So one of the centrepieces of today's Autumn Statement and Spending Review is what the Treasury describes as the ""biggest affordable housebuilding programme since the 1970s"". There will be a substantial £2.3bn of government funding for the construction of so-called starter homes - or homes up to a value of £250,000, or £450,000 in London, which will be sold at a 20% discount to those under 40 buying their first home. And there will be a big push on semi-privatisation of social housing, with £4bn of finance for shared ownership of residential properties - which will also include a big push on encouraging private developers to promote his Help-to-Buy scheme. It's bonanza time for mass housebuilders, especially if the chancellor succeeds in loosening planning constraints, as he wants to do. And it's thin gruel - again - for housing associations, which are being obliged to shrink by selling properties at big discounts to tenants and which are having difficulty building even what they had planned to do following the Treasury's decision to force them to cut rents. That imposed rental cut was an attempt to shrink the housing benefit bill. And here perhaps is the best way of seeing Osborne's British vision: slash tax credits by forcing the cost of providing decent wages on businesses; reduce housing benefit, by spurring a boom in cheap housing, cutting rents and stimulating private ownership, It is a shrinking of the state, that - in theory, and over the medium term - should not impoverish the working poor. But there may well be pain for what MPs perhaps patronisingly call ""strivers"" in the period of transition, And whether in practice too many vulnerable people will fall through shrunken and lowered state safety nets will be one of the big political questions in this parliament - and which may decide whether George Osborne achieves his ambition of relocating to Number 10.","If George Osborne has a big idea, it is to transfer the costs of and responsibility for building a better, fairer Britain from the public sector to the private sector."
"Factories in the 17-country bloc saw output rise by 1% in the month, which was better than analysts' forecasts. The figures showed that the highest increase was registered in Portugal, where output grew by 8.2%. Europe's economic powerhouse, Germany, saw output rise 1.8%, while French output increased by 0.2% following three consecutive months of decline. However, output in Italy fell by 0.3%. This was the second decline in a row, as Italy's economy continued to falter. Germany, France and Italy make up two-thirds of the overall production figure for the eurozone. 'Slowly recovering' Chris Williamson, chief economist at the researchers Markit, said that while the figures were encouraging there was still cause for concern over the strength of the bloc's recovery. While production had rebounded in August, he noted that this ""merely brings output back to June's level, which was still some 12.5% below its pre-crisis peak"". However, he added that the upturn is ""an encouraging sign that the sector is slowly recovering"". ""Policymakers will be encouraged by the ongoing recovery trend, but will be reminded of the huge surplus of capacity that persists compared to before the crisis struck."" In August, the eurozone emerged from an 18-month recession, after reporting growth of 0.3%. However, economists have cautioned that growth and manufacturing figures will remain choppy, and that the recovery from recession is far from secure. Earlier this month, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said that the economic recovery in the eurozone remained ""weak, fragile, uneven"".","Industrial output in the eurozone grew at the strongest pace for more than two years in August, figures have shown."
"The sentences were carried out on Friday, state TV reported. In November last year, the Belarusian supreme court found Dmitry Konovalov, 25, guilty of carrying out the explosion and Vladislav Kovalyov, also 25, of assisting him. The attack on 11 April 2011 killed 15 people and wounded hundreds of others. President Alexander Lukashenko decided not to reprieve the two men last Wednesday, despite calls to do so from human rights groups and the Council of Europe. Kovalyov's mother received a letter from the authorities notifying her of her son's execution by shooting, the man's sister said. Rights groups had questioned the validity of the pair's convictions, arguing that no motive had been provided during their trial and that conflicting accounts had cast doubt on their involvement in the attacks. Although Konovalov had admitted guilt at the start of the trial, Kovalyov withdrew his testimony, explaining that he had given evidence to investigators under duress. Lyubov Kovalyova blamed herself for her son's death, suggesting that he had been executed ""because I hired a lawyer, because I started to fight, because my son told the truth and the trial did not go as it was supposed to"". International condemnations In a statement, EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton condemned the execution of both men, saying they had not been accorded due legal process. British Europe Minister David Lidingtonsaid in a statementthat independent reports had ""raised serious and credible concerns over the standard of evidence and fairness"" of the trial that the two men had received. The president of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, Jean-Claude Mignon, of France, said the executions had ""no place in a civilised society"". The German government said they would put further strain on ties between the EU and Belarus. ""Lukashenko thus drifts even further away from our European values,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Ronald Pofalla, said. Belarus is the only nation in Europe still using capital punishment. Official figures are not released, but reports suggest nearly 300 people have been executed in Belarus since the collapse of the Soviet Union.","EU leaders have condemned Belarus for executing two men convicted of carrying out a bomb attack on the underground railway in the capital, Minsk."
"Rockliffe Hall in Darlington claimed on its business interruption policy after it closed as a result of the pandemic. But Travelers Insurance argued that, while some closures caused by infectious diseases were covered, Covid-19 was not included. Mrs Justice Cockerill agreed with the insurers and struck out the case. The court heard the five-star hotel's policy covered 34 illnesses including food poisoning, cholera, smallpox and plague. 'Famine, war and pestilence' The policy began before the new coronavirus was discovered but its wording was specific and limited to certain listed diseases, Mrs Justice Cockerill found. ""The policy could have included 'catch-all' wording, but it did not,"" she said. A number of other known diseases were also not on the list, she added. Rockliffe Hall's lawyers argued the reference to ""plague"" in the policy should be read as a general term for an infectious disease with a high mortality rate and not just as a reference to illnesses caused by a specific bacteria, such as the bubonic plague. However Mrs Justice Cockerill concluded the word was ""obviously intended"" to refer to a specific disease. ""Matters might of course be different if 'plague' were in the company of 'famine', war' and 'pestilence',"" she said. The hotel had also claimed Covid-19 could cause, or be associated with, some of the diseases on the policy's list, such as meningitis and encephalitis, meaning insurance cover should be granted.

"The three were approached by officers on the beach in Sainte-Marie-La-Mer following a complaint from a holidaying family. The incident generated a huge backlash against the officers. Backing the women, the minister, Gérald Darmanin, tweeted: ""Freedom is a precious commodity"". He said it was wrong the women were asked to put on clothing. A press release posted on Facebook by the Pyrenees-Orientales police said the incident happened last week. Two officers asked three people on the beach to cover their chests, after a request from a family concerned about children present. ""Guided by a desire for appeasement, the police asked the people concerned if they would agree to cover their chest after they explained the reason for their approach,"" it said. ""No municipal order forbids this practice [topless sunbathing] in Sainte-Marie-la-Mer."" Their action prompted a wave of criticism online. Some questioned a wave of ""prudishness"" sweeping France, while others questioned if the practice was now banned. Police spokeswoman Lt Col Maddy Scheurer blamed the ""clumsiness"" of the two officers for the incident. ""You will always see me in uniform,"" she wrote, ""but the practice of topless tanning is allowed at the beach of Sainte-Marie-la-Mer."" While Mr Darmanin said it was wrong that the women were asked to cover up, he said it was ""normal for the administration to recognise its mistakes"". It is not illegal to sunbathe topless in France, although local authorities can ban the practice with directives about clothing. A survey by the website VieHealthy in 2019 showed the practice is less common in France now than it was in the past, and is less common than in other European countries. The survey said 22% of French women asked had sunbathed topless, compared with 48% of Spanish women and 34% of Germans.",France's interior minister has defended topless sunbathing after police asked a group of women on a Mediterranean beach to cover up.
"By Vicky BakerBBC News The allegations of torture seem impossible to comprehend next to the family photos circulated in the press that show the smiling group on days out at places like Disneyland. We asked experts in child abuse, psychiatry and psychology how parents are able to turn on their offspring. How unusual is it to lock up your own children? The Turpins' case is extraordinary for numerous reasons - particularly as the allegations are against two parents who had multiple children together. Prof Browne, director of the Centre for Forensic and Family Psychology at the University of Nottingham, says it is more common to see cases where there is one child and the parent or parents cannot cope, so the situation spirals out of control. The 'happy family' charged with torture Dr Bernard Gallagher, a child protection expert at the University of Huddersfield, says: ""I see a lot of cases of neglect, where children are not washed or fed properly, but you don't often get cases of children being tortured, where the abuse seems calculated."" Can parents operate as an abusive team? ""When you get two people working together, they support each other and their behaviour becomes normal to them,"" says Coral Dando, a psychology professor at London's University of Westminster. ""They behave in a way they would never behave on their own."" Though, one partner can also be controlled and led on by the other, she adds. ""We tend to think of this as women being coerced into action by a man, as it is more common, but that is not always true."" How can abuse escalate? When announcing the charges against the Turpins, local district attorney Mike Hestrin said the mistreatment appeared to intensify over time. ""What started out as neglect became severe, pervasive, prolonged child abuse,"" he said. Louise Turpin's sister, Elizabeth Jane Flores, told Good Morning America she stayed with the family 20 years ago and saw no specific signs of abuse, although she found their parenting style was strict. Prof Browne says a situation can suddenly get worse because the perpetrators want to conceal a family secret, perhaps relating to the abuse. ""At some point, it becomes out of control, physically and socially, and they [the parents] have to control freedom of movement so the information can't be shared,"" he says. Dr Eileen Vizard, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, says: ""I can't comment specifically on current or past cases, but based on published research evidence and my clinical experience, cases of extreme abuse have often involved children who are hidden away in 'plain sight'."" ""They may live with their families but they have no access to outsiders, such as professionals or playmates,"" she explains. ""This means that abusing parents or carers never learn that there can be consequences from their cruel behaviours to children and children, in turn, never experience ordinary, non-abusing adults."" This, in turn, can create a relationship that has some elements of Stockholm syndrome, where abducted individuals identify with the abductor to ensure their own survival. ""Some victims may identify themselves closely with the abusing parents about whom they may feel, paradoxically, very protective,"" says Dr Vizard. How can abusive parents reconcile two sides of their lives? Professor Browne says double lives ""can be indicative of a personality order, where, say, a family man is sweet-as-can-be at home but a tyrant behind closed doors."" Dr Vizard says: ""There are common mental mechanisms, such as 'splitting' and 'projection', which we all use to ignore aspects of our own bad behaviour or to attribute our bad behaviour to others as being their fault. Child victims may, in turn, feel that it is 'all their fault'."" Sometimes people can also use a warped version of religion to justify their actions, says Dr Gallagher, as they can convince themselves that a child is evil. How can such levels of abuse be unknown? Prof Dando, a former police officer who has also worked on modern slavery cases in her academic life, says that even when the victims have some contact with the outside world, fear can prevent them making a bid for freedom. ""For example, modern slavery victims go to work every day. They interact with the general public and they don't tell anyone, they even give their money to their abusers. That is the how they are being controlled - by threats and manipulation,"" she explains. In the Turpin case, the children appear not to have had access to help. They did not attend school and instead Mr Turpin registered a private school in their home. Dr Danya Glaser, a London-based child and adult psychiatrist, said home-schooling can allow children to go completely off the social radar. ""There is nothing inherently wrong with home-schooling, but when there are no inspections, you can essentially end up with hidden children,"" she says. One of the Turpin's neighbours told NBC News that they would see the children through the upper windows, late at night, marching in single file for hours. Dr Glaser says: ""If you know there are children living next door to you and you never see them or their behaviour is very odd, that should ring some bells."" She says people should not be afraid to raise their worries, via the police, the local authorities, or a child abuse charity. ""It does not have to be an allegation, just a registered concern. That is one thing everyone can learn from this.""",David and Louise Turpin stand accused of holding their 13 children in shackles at their California home.

"About 3,000 goldfish were discovered in Colliers Wood Pond, near Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. It thought the fish numbers grew from a handful of abandoned pets. People have been warned not to illegally dump their pets in waterways. Dumping invasive species in the wild contravenes Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The Goldfish (Carrasius auratus) is a coldwater fish that can live for up to 15 years, and grow much larger than typical domestic pets kept in bowls and tanks. Females can breed several times during a summer, and are capable of producing thousands of offspring a year. Thousands of litres were pumped out of the pond to clear out the fish, which were causing environmental problems and overrunning native species. The animals were removed on Friday and will be sent to pet shops so they can find new homes. Mat Faulkner, from MF Aquatics, who carried out the clearing work on behalf of Broxtowe Borough Council, said the fish probably bred from a handful of pets abandoned in the waterways. ""The banks have been eroded where they've been digging away looking for food,"" he said. ""They'll eat tadpoles, small frogs, and invertebrates and insect life, which means you'll see a reduction in dragonflies and that kind of natural habitat, and in the numbers they're in here, en masse, they'll do that quite quickly and quite successfully.""

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The scheme promises to reduce costs as in-house monitors will make energy consumption more visible and therefore controllable, and will remove the need for estimated bills. However this month the roll-out was delayed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change for more than a year as the government admitted more tests were still needed. One big issue for information security experts is the safety of the data collected by the meters and transferred back to the utility companies. While there are many different brands of meter, the communications hubs which transmit this information often use the mobile data network via a SIM card, security consultant Eireann Leverett from IO Active told the BBC. Hacking options ""There are two main ways of hacking the meters,"" he said. ""Through the mobile network they use to communicate, or through hardware hacking - opening the meter up, tampering, altering the firmware or removing the cryptographic keys."" Utility companies are reluctant to use home broadband services for data transmission because they could be liable if an individual's account was hacked, he added, and the meters themselves could be vulnerable as many of them will be outside properties or in communal areas. The problem is that making the new digital meters more secure requires considerable investment for a relatively low-cost product, Mr Leverett explained. ""It's hard to do,"" he said. ""The meters have to be very inexpensive to roll out across the country - it's a real challenge fitting in the security that people need with keeping the cost down."" Some manufacturers have been more involved with the information security community than others, he added. ""Those that have solved problems have generally solved them in one dimension. So they've protected the privacy of the customer - actually we don't see that very often - or they've protected the flow of data to the communications hub and the data centre but they haven' t necessarily protected the hardware."" But why is someone else's energy use of interest to a hacker? ""There are many diverse reasons for hacking attacks - one of them might be revenge. They can put a business out of business - if I can raise the price of electricity for a business I don't like for three months they might have trouble paying that off."" National concerns On a national level, the hacking of a nation's entire power grid via its smart meter network could be catastrophic. ""While you as the individual may not be an important person that is worth hacking, being able to hack lots of devices at the same time can produce other effects on the country that we are concerned about,"" said Mr Leverett. In 2010 Prof Ross Anderson of the computer science department at Cambridge University wrote a paper expressing his concerns about ""strategic vulnerability"" for the UK's infrastructure with the introduction of smart meters. He rather scathingly told the BBC he believed the scheme remained ""as much as a mess as ever"" and blamed political decisions. That same year the FBI discovered hacks on smart meters in Puerto Rico. Security expert Brian Krebs reported on his blog that the FBI found that using cheap tools and software available online, former employees of the power firm and meter maker made gadgets under-report energy use by up to 75%. Eireann Leverett does believe that ultimately the meters, if they are properly secured, will be beneficial for households. ""The idea is that you don't have any visibility of what price you're using electricity at. This will give you a real-time examination of that,"" he said. ""You can say,' I'm going to stop using my washing machine at peak time...' - users who have trialled the meters say their bills went down by 20% to 30%."" Government standards Energy and Climate Change minister Baroness Verma told the BBC the government was working with the National Technical Authority on security issues. ""It's right that we look at security because security will be a key issue for everyone, but the way we've done it and the way we expect industry to respond to it is by making sure they are working to very vigorous and robust measurements to ensure that consumers' privacy and data are absolutely secure,"" she said. ""[Manufacturers] will have to produce annual audits and make sure their own risk assessments are meeting the standards we are putting into place.""","By the year 2020 about 30 million British homes will have digital smart meters monitoring their gas and electricity usage, according to government plans."

"By Dickens OleweBBC News His main target has been French World War Two hero Gen Philippe Leclerc in the country's biggest city, Douala. ""I have decapitated Leclerc's head seven times and toppled the statue at least 20 times,"" Mr Essama told the BBC. ""I use my bare hands... but I make an incantation to the ancestors first,"" he said. His aim is to replace them with Cameroonian and other African heroes, but he will make an exception for those who campaigned for ""the good of humanity"". He is especially keen on erecting a statue of Diana, the late Princess of Wales. ""Diana was against racism and she stood for humanity. We loved her here in Cameroon,"" Mr Essama said. Mr Essama has also targeted a statue of Gustav Nachtigal, who arrived in Cameroon in 1884 to establish a German empire. During World War One, British and French troops forced the Germans out, later splitting the German-occupied territory between them. Seven heads restored The authorities see his activities as vandalism, arguing that African heroes can be celebrated without removing colonial symbols. Mr Essama has been imprisoned several times for cutting the head off Gen Leclerc's statue - serving up to six months at a time. Sometimes he has avoided a jail term by paying fines, with the money mostly raised by his supporters in Cameroon and in the diaspora. Each time he has damaged Gen Leclerc's statue in the main square in Douala, the authorities have restored it. With one hand on hip, the other holding a walking stick, the French hero stands on a plinth in front of a curved stone relief depicting the French World War Two military arsenal, including tanks and planes. It was erected by the French colonisers in 1948, long before Cameroon became independent in 1960. 'Seen as a god in France' In France, Gen Leclerc is celebrated for his role in rallying troops in the 1940s in France's then-colonies to fight the German occupation. ""Leclerc is the great hero who helped liberate France... so the French regard him as a god,"" a history professor at the UK's Oxford University, Robert Gildea, told the BBC. But he was unpopular in Cameroon, retired Cameroonian academic Prof Valere Epee said. ""Cameroonians didn't like him because he seemed not to care for the people. ""He was not like French President Charles de Gaulle, who visited Cameroon twice, and whom people seem to have an affection for."" Gen Leclerc died in a plane crash in Algeria in 1947, three years after the liberation of Paris. Thousands of people lined the streets in the French capital to pay tribute to him. Several memorial plaques have been installed in his honour in France, two streets in Paris have been named after him and a military tank, still in service, bears his name. 'Our heroes first' His venerated status does not impress Mr Essama. ""He is not our hero,"" says the 44-year-old activist, who is a computer science graduate. ""Gen Leclerc has come to represent the erasure of Cameroonian colonial memory and replacing it with a French one."" Mr Essama has collected seven heads of Gen Leclerc over the years, and has occasionally taken them on to the streets to ""sensitise Cameroonians about the country's history"". He says he was inspired by Cameroonian nationalist Mboua Massock, who once graffitied the general's statue with the words: ""Our own heroes and martyrs first."" ""We sing in our anthem, 'Oh Cameroon land of our ancestors.' How is it that our ancestors are not represented in public spaces?"" In 1991, Cameroon's President Paul Biya signed a declaration to rehabilitate the memory of the country's heroes who had been denigrated because of their role during the fight for independence. ""Not much has been done since the law was signed,"" Mr Essama said. French hero 'now behind bars' A history professor at the University of South Africa, Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni, says that statues and monuments ""have become soft targets in the struggle against decolonisation"". ""The Europeans were thinking they were the only people on earth and, therefore, there was emptiness outside Europe, which was waiting to be discovered,"" he told the BBC, quoting the late American anthropologist James Blaut's views on Eurocentrism. ""If you follow that logic: you discover a place, you name it, eliminate what you find there, then you conquer, then you own it, and statues are symbols of ownership,"" he said. ""In the former colonies, the statues mean that the colonisers have not repented for the sins they committed against the local people but their presence in the home country means that this is the conqueror of the world, this is our hero."" He dismisses the argument that statues should be protected because of their historical significance. ""If your statue is history, the indigenous people are saying: 'But you wrote your history on top of my history. It is overshadowing our own histories.'"" You may also be interested in: Prof Ndlovu-Gatsheni said the targeting of statues was part of a multifaceted campaign by Africans. ""There are those who topple statues, others want to stop the use of West Africa's CFA currency [which is pegged to the euro], others are pushing for reparations, all these are part of the struggle against the empire."" As for Mr Essama, he is now less focussed on decapitating statues, turning his attention to fundraising to build statues of Cameroonian heroes and calling for reparations for colonial-era crimes. So far his advocacy group, Essama Hoo Haa, has helped install two statues. One is of Samuel Mbappé Léppé, considered Cameroon's best ever footballer, ""better than Roger Milla and Samuel Eto'o"", Mr Essama says. The other is of John Ngu Foncha, a former prime minister who championed the cause of greater autonomy for Cameroon's mainly English-speaking regions. Gen Leclerc's statue does still occupy Mr Essama's mind, though it has become more difficult to target because it is now sealed off and has guards protecting it. ""He is in prison,"" Mr Essama said with a wry chuckle.","Cameroonian activist Andre Blaise Essama has been on a decades-long mission to purge his country of colonial-era symbols, long before the issue came to international prominence in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests."
"No - we have no idea either. Basically, a five-day-old pup got separated from its mum in a creek, waddled out of the water and found itself washed up in the middle of a field. The result is a picture to do the rounds on social media. She was saved by a birdwatcher who spotted her at an RSPB sanctuary on the banks of The Wash in Lincolnshire. Ian Ellis noticed the herd surrounding the baby seal through his telescope. He was advised to move it while RSPB staff warden Toby Collett came to collect her. The seal has now been named Celebration to mark Natureland seal sanctuary's 50th anniversary and she is now recovering at the centre. Ian, 67, from Boston, said: ""There are seals on the edge of the marsh but it was the way the cows were so inquisitive that made me look. ""Toby picked up the seal and I put it in my coat and carried it to the car park all the way down the sea bank to be rescued."" The pup is a harbour seal who give birth in the summer months. Celebration will continue through the rehabilitation process until she is 60-70lb and is able to feed in the water by herself. ""We will then release her back to the wild.""

"Images show Joaquin Guzman pacing his cell at Altiplano jail several times on Saturday evening before heading into the shower area and disappearing. A small hole leading to a tunnel has since been found and a massive manhunt is under way. It is the second time Guzman, known as El Chapo or ""Shorty"", has escaped jail. He broke out from a Mexican high-security prison in 2001 and was not recaptured until 2014. Inside help Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said officials at Altiplano jail prison must have helped him in his latest escape. Three senior prison officials, including the director of the jail, have been dismissed. The escape tunnel was more than 1.5km (1 mile) long. It measured 1.70m in height and led to a building outside the prison perimeter. Security officials said it could have taken a year to build. It has emerged that Chapo Guzman fled despite wearing a monitoring bracelet and being subject to 24-hour surveillance. A reward of 60 million pesos ($3.8m; £2.4m) for his capture has been offered. Most wanted Guzman's rise to head of the Sinaloa cartel made him one of the world's most wanted drug trafficker. The cartel controls much of the flow of cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine to the US. Before his recapture in 2014, the US state department had offered a reward of up to $5m (£3.2m) for information leading to his arrest. His wealth is estimated at $1bn (£630m).",Mexican authorities have released CCTV footage showing the moments before the country's most-wanted drug lord escaped from his prison cell.
"Lord Hall said the decision had been hard, adding: ""If I followed my heart I would genuinely never want to leave."" But he said he felt it was important the BBC had the same leader for the BBC's mid-term review in 2022 and the renewal of its charter in 2027. The National Gallery subsequently announced he had been appointed chair of its board of trustees. The BBC's chairman, Sir David Clementi, said the search for the BBC's next leader would begin ""within the next few weeks"". He added that the BBC was ""committed to selecting the best-qualified person for the job"". BBC Newsnight understands Lord Hall had wanted to stay until the BBC's centenary in 2022, but after ""big discussions with the board"" it was decided he would go earlier. The programme's political editor Nicholas Watt said the timing was being interpreted in government circles as ""something of a masterstroke"" by Sir David, whose term as chairman ends in 2021. ""Had Tony Hall waited until 2022 it would have been a new chairman of the BBC making the appointment, and that new chairman would have been appointed by Boris Johnson's government,"" said the correspondent. Potential successors James Purnell, the former Labour politician who became the BBC's director of radio and education in 2016, is currently the bookmakers' favourite to take on the role. Fran Unsworth, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, is another contender, as is Anne Bulford, the BBC's first female deputy director general, who left the corporation last year. Media commentators are also speculating, with The Independent's Adam Sherwin suggesting Channel 4's chief executive Alex Mahon might be in the frame, along with Apple's Jay Hunt and Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content. The Guardian also points to these female candidates but also suggests former Ofcom chief Sharon White and Gail Rebuck, chair of Penguin Random House UK, might be in contention. Newsnight's Nicholas Watt said he was hearing that the cabinet ""are expecting the BBC to sound them out on this appointment"", and there was ""no appetite"" in the government for ""a BBC lifer"" who is not interested in reform. Speaking of Lord Hall, Sir David said the corporation had been ""lucky to have him"". He described him as ""an inspirational creative leader"" who had ""led the BBC with integrity and a passion for our values"". Culture secretary Nicky Morgan thanked Lord Hall for his service, saying he had made ""a huge contribution to public service broadcasting in his career"". ""In this ever changing broadcast landscape the next DG will need to build on Lord Hall's success,"" she wrote on Twitter. 'Change has been tough' In a letter to staff, Lord Hall said he believed he would be ""leaving the BBC in a much stronger place than when I joined"". His appointment in 2012 followed the resignation of George Entwistle in the wake of the Newsnight Lord McAlpine row. Lord Hall said the BBC felt ""a very different organisation"" that was ""more innovative, more open, more inclusive, more efficient [and] more commercially aware"". What does the director general do? The director general, or DG, is the chief executive officer of the BBC, its editor-in-chief. The person in the post is the editorial, operational and creative leader of the corporation, with responsibility for a worldwide workforce running services across television, radio and online. The DG and the BBC board are responsible for the effective running of the BBC, delivering its public service and commercial services - including BBC Studios - both at home and abroad. The DG is appointed by the BBC board. As of April 2019, the holder of the post is paid £450,000 a year. ""Change has been tough at times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe our recent record of transformation stands comparison with virtually any other creative organisation in the world."" Lord Hall takes over at the National Gallery in London from interim chair Sir John Kingman, who has been in the post since Hannah Rothschild's departure in September 2019. He said: ""I am proud to take on the role of its chair. The National Gallery isn't just about serving those who already love art, but reaching a wider audience and future generations."" His appointment was welcomed by Baroness Morgan, who said he would bring ""a wealth of experience"" to the role. Analysis - BBC media editor Amol Rajan Director general of the BBC is one of the most privileged, but also one of the most relentless and tough jobs in Britain - and it gets tougher every day, because of the technological context. His successor will need to combine world-class political, commercial, editorial and managerial talent, while coming under a relentless barrage of criticism from all fronts. The question of who gets it will depend on where the BBC Board and its chairman, Sir David Clementi, want to place their emphasis. Someone with commercial nous, or someone who can charm Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings? Someone with a track record at managing talent - or someone who can make a brave, correct call on a Panorama investigation? The perfect candidate will be able to do all this - and therefore doesn't exist. Read more from Amol here Lord Hall's departure from the BBC comes amid another turbulent time for the broadcaster, with issues around equal pay disputes, political bias, diversity and TV licences at the top of its agenda. Earlier this month presenter Samira Ahmed won an employment tribunal in a dispute over equal pay, while radio presenter Sarah Montague has confirmed she won a settlement and an apology from the BBC after being treated ""unequally"". The BBC has also faced criticism over its reporting on the recent general election, presenter pay, star salaries and a lack of diversity both on and off screen. It also found itself in the spotlight back in 2018 when Sir Cliff Richard won a High Court case against the broadcaster over its coverage of a police raid on his home. Last year TV presenter and campaigner June Sarpong was appointed the BBC's first director of creative diversity in a bid to improve the BBC's ""on-air talent portrayal"". Sarpong said it had been a ""great pleasure and honour"" to work under Lord Hall's ""visionary leadership"". ""I cannot overstate the support he has shown me in helping to start the process of inclusive change,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""He will be sincerely missed."" Other developments during Lord Hall's tenure include the growth of BBC iPlayer, the increasing success of BBC Studios. and the launches of BBC Sounds and streaming service Britbox. It was also announced last year that free TV licences for all over 75s would be scrapped and replaced by a scheme based on pension credit benefit. Last week Lord Hall outlined a plan that will see at least two thirds of the corporation's staff based outside London by 2027. Lord Hall - a mini biography Lord Hall, 68, joined the corporation as a trainee in the Belfast newsroom in 1973. He became editor of the Nine O'Clock News at the age of 34 and was appointed chief executive of BBC News in 1996. While there, he launched BBC Radio 5 Live, the news channel, the BBC News website and the parliament channel. He left in 2001 to become the chief executive of the the Royal Opera House until 2013, and was also deputy chairman of Channel 4. He was also on the board of the London organising committee for the Olympic Games before returning to the BBC in the top job. Lord Hall, whose official title is The Lord Hall of Birkenhead, was made a cross-bench peer in 2010. Reaction to news Bonnie Greer, who served alongside Lord Hall on the Royal Opera House board, noted that the BBC had been going through a difficult period. ""I think it's been a lot of pressure for the organisation and a lot of pressure for him,"" the playwright and critic said on The Victoria Derbyshire Show. Talent agent Jonathan Shalit said Lord Hall had been ""fantastic"" in the director general role and that it was ""normal"" for someone in his position to move on after seven years. ""He was going to be moving on soon,"" he told the same BBC programme. ""I think the point he makes about making sure one person oversees the midway point of the licence fee is important."" Philippa Childs, head of broadcast trade union Bectu, said Lord Hall had been ""a strong advocate for the BBC, its staff [and] the licence fee"". She said the outgoing director general had always ""acted with integrity and transparency"" during their ""extremely positive and productive working relationship"". Veteran presenter David Dimbleby said Lord Hall ""revived the place"" because of his passion for broadcasting. On the future of the BBC, Dimbleby added: ""It's always worth remembering, I think in the end, people trust the BBC more than the politicians who try to diminish it. ""I'm not saying there aren't major, major problems with the BBC at the moment; I think there are."" Former BBC chairman Michael Grade said he did not believe that Sir David, or the BBC board, would allow the government to interfere with the appointment of the director general.

"Arturas Busma, 39, was found with a stab wound to the chest, burn marks and stamp injuries, police said. He met Simon Wilkins, 28, for the first time outside a shop in Wolverhampton in April and went back to his nearby flat where he was murdered. At Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday, Wilkins was told he will serve a minimum 17-and-a-half-years. West Midlands Police said Mr Busma had been lured to the address in Tettenhall Road after meeting Wilkins outside the convenience store and buying alcohol. At the flat, Wilkins carried out a sustained attack and tortured his victim, the force said. There was no evidence to suggest the pair had met before and Mr Busma had been in ""the wrong place at the wrong time"", the force added. After the attack, Wilkins, who previously admitted murder, went to Wolverhampton police station and told officers he had punched a man, who had stopped breathing, and claimed it was in retaliation after Mr Busma pulled a knife on him. But after visiting the flat, detectives found only Mr Busma's badly beaten body. 'Loving husband' A post-mortem examination found Mr Busma had suffered significant blunt force trauma to his head and body. Det Insp Laura Harrison, said: ""Sadly the family of Mr Busma will never really know why their loved one was taken away in such a brutal way. ""It appeared he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and happened to come across Wilkins.""

"He told the BBC he had been in talks with Labour MPs but added: ""We've got to keep building the case"". He admitted it would be harder to get the support if Labour ordered its MPs to vote against air strikes in Syria. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, who opposes air strikes, said he had not decided whether to offer them a free vote. MPs could vote next week on whether to extend UK air strikes against IS into Syria, but the government has said it will not call the vote unless it is certain to win. Ministers need the support of enough Labour MPs to compensate for Conservative rebels who will vote against military intervention, and Mr Fallon said he had been briefing Labour MPs on the government's case. More on this story: Analysis by Ben Wright, political correspondent, BBC News It's all about the numbers. Even though the government has a majority of 12, a number of Conservative MPs - perhaps a dozen - have strong doubts about extending air strikes to Syria. And the government will not risk a defeat in the House of Commons. In fact, it wants an emphatic win. The government won't get the support of SNP MPs, the third largest party in Parliament, so it needs a chunk of Labour MPs with it. Some Labour MPs had briefings with the MoD this weekend and are wrestling with the arguments, listening to constituents. It is why Jeremy Corbyn's decision is so important. If he allows a free vote, perhaps half his shadow cabinet and around 60 Labour MPs may vote for air strikes. If he insists on collective opposition there will be an almighty row within the Parliamentary Labour Party that could scupper the government's plans. One shadow cabinet minster has told me there's a chance Labour will not agree a position on Monday at all and will wait for the wording of the government's motion before deciding how to vote. It will be a crucial week. Asked if the numbers were in place to support action, Mr Fallon said ""not yet"", but that ministers were ""working at it"".. ""You shouldn't extend military operations lightly,"" he said. ""There are legitimate questions to answer and we're doing our best to answer them."" He also rejected suggestions attacking IS, also known as Isil, would make the UK more of a target. saying: ""There are always risks in war but there is a greater risk from not doing something about Isil and leaving our streets vulnerable to the kind of slaughter we saw in Paris."" MPs rejected a vote for air strikes against Syrian government targets in 2013. However, it is taking part in air strikes against IS in Iraq after MPs backed the move last year. Mr Corbyn, who has set out his opposition to bombing, reiterated his position, saying he ""seriously questions"" the government's claim there are 70,000 moderate opposition fighters on the ground. He said: ""There also has to be a recognition that if we bomb in Raqqa we are going to take out civilian lives, we may not in effect do very much damage to Isil and actually may make the situation worse not better."" 'No decision yet' The Labour leader said it would be for him to decide whether to offer a free vote to his MPs, which would mean they would not be bound to follow the party line. He added: ""No decision has been made on that yet, I am going to find out what MPs think. ""Obviously there are strong views on both directions. We will have a further discussion on this. We will make that decision not at this moment but later on."" Mr Corbyn said he had received 70,000 responses to a survey sent out to Labour supporters on Friday canvassing their opinions on air strikes, and a decision would be taken ""as a party"". There is mounting pressure for a free vote, a move supported by shadow chancellor and Corbyn ally John McDonnell. Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer said there were ""significant differences"" within Mr Corbyn's top team on the issue which he did not think could be reconciled. Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said he would vote with his conscience even if ordered to follow the party line, adding on Sky News that there was ""no shame in there being a broad range of views on issues of war and peace"" within Labour ranks. Both Mr Umunna and Lord Falconer said they were minded to support air strikes. 'Not convinced' Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who plans to oppose air strikes, said a free vote should be offered because the issue is a ""matter of conscience"". But two other MPs, who both suggested they too would vote against air strikes, said they felt the vote should be whipped. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, both Liam Byrne and Jess Phillips criticised Mr Corbyn's handling of the situation. SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said his party had not been convinced by the argument for military action. Unless the government could present a plan ""to avoid the anarchy of Libya"", he said, ""of course we couldn't possibly support conflict in the current climate"". UKIP's Nigel Farage was dismissive of the government's strategy. ""What the prime minister and Michael Fallon were saying is, let's send another three jets, that's all we're talking about. I'm sorry, I don't believe that. I've heard these arguments over repeated military interventions.""","The government does not yet have enough votes from MPs to back air strikes against Islamic State (IS) in Syria, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said."
"Police officers have been asked to provide the home affairs minister with a report about drug-driving. The aim is to help the minister to decide whether to invest in the equipment. The minister, Senator Ian Le Marquand, said it was something he had been looking into for a while. He said: ""When I was Magistrate I was coming across cases where people were driving under the influence of drugs. ""The practical problem in the past was defining what was a limit above which you would commit the offence. ""It seems to me the science must have moved on and they are now reasonably confident in the UK that they can do that and if they can, I am delighted.""",Devices could be used by Jersey's police to measure whether someone has been driving under the influence of drugs.
"Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said sales tax would rise from 18% to 21%, and local authorities would have their budgets slashed. He is aiming to save 65bn euros (£51bn; $80bn) as part of a deal with eurozone leaders to help rescue Spain's banks. The move coincided with a miners' rally in Madrid, where police fired rubber bullets at crowds of protesters. Thousands of people joined in the rally to support the miners, who have been campaigning for weeks against major cuts to industry subsidies. Witnesses said protesters out to support the miners threw fireworks, bottles and stones at riot police. The officers fired rubber bullets and charged at the demonstrators. Five people were arrested and three people suffered minor injuries, according to the AFP news agency. 'Circumstances change' The prime minister, interrupted several times by opposition MPs, told parliament that the changes he was announcing had to be adopted without delay. Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to provide 30bn euros (£24bn) for Spain's troubled banks by the end of the month and to give Madrid an extra year - until 2014 - to hit its budget targets. Mr Rajoy acknowledged that the VAT rise contradicted a campaign pledge made before his Popular Party came to power. As recently as January he said there was no plan to raise the tax. ""I said I would lower taxes and I am actually raising them. Circumstances change and I have to adapt to them."" The package of measures would cut the budget by 65bn euros over two-and-a-half years, he said. ""The excesses of the past are being paid for right now,"" he said, adding that Spaniards had never before experienced such a recession. Without a cut in Spain's budget deficit, public services would be put at risk, he said. Savings of 3.5bn euros will be made to government administration budgets, with local authorities banned from offering services they cannot afford and the number of councillors reduced by 30% in some areas. The door had been opened to a new EU model, Mr Rajoy said, and the summit agreements had committed everyone equally. Spain's unemployment is running at more than 24% and analysts say European leaders want to see a credible Spanish plan for viability and deficit reduction. ""What animates us is the five million people out of work,"" Mr Rajoy told parliament. The European Commission praised the Spanish government's ""determination"" and swift action. ""It's an important step to ensure that the fiscal targets for this year can be met,"" spokesman Simon O'Connor told reporters. Mass rally Thousands of miners marched through the centre of Madrid towards the industry ministry to protest against plans to slash coal industry subsidies from 301m euros last year to 111m euros this year. ""It's just cuts and more cuts,"" David Menendez, a miner from Asturias, told the Associated Press news agency. He and his colleagues had been further angered by the latest round of tax increases and spending cuts. Many of the workers had walked hundreds of miles since 22 June from northern Spain, where demonstrations outside coal mines have resulted in clashes with police. Unions say the cuts threaten 30,000 jobs and could destroy their industry. The Spanish government argues that it pays disproportionately high subsidies to a small and unprofitable part of the economy. Spain's 30bn-euro bank bailout will be the first instalment of a package worth up to 100bn euros agreed in June. Eurozone ministers must get approval from their own parliaments and hope to make the payment by the end of July.","Spain's government has announced sweeping new austerity measures, amid clashes between protesters and police."
"The Oscar-winning star plays British scientist Rosalind Franklin, the only woman involved in the discovery of DNA's double helix in 1953. Anna Ziegler's play opened on Monday to a string of four-star reviews. Directed by Michael Grandage, it runs at the Noel Coward Theatre until 21 November. According to The Guardian, Kidman gives ""a commanding, intelligent performance"" in her first West End appearance in 17 years. ""My only complaint about Anna Ziegler's intriguing, informative 95-minute play is that it is not longer,"" wrote Michael Billington. Praising Kidman's portrayal of the ecstasy of scientific discovery, Billington said her features ""acquire a luminous intensity"" as she stares at the now-famous photograph that reveals the DNA's helix pattern. ""It is a fine performance in which Kidman reminds us that the scientific life can be informed by private passion,"" the review continued. When Kidman appeared, briefly unclothed, in Sir David Hare's The Blue Room at the Donmar Warehouse in 1998, her performance was famously described by the Daily Telegraph's Charles Spencer as ""pure theatrical Viagra"". Spencer's successor, Dominic Cavendish, was equally effusive in his review of Photograph 51, writing that ""Kidman displays once again the power to hold us in thrall"". ""Although her kit is Fifties demure, the caboodle of her nuanced performance is the stuff of intoxication,"" his four-star review continued. ""Kidman is even better communicating a life of the mind than she was all those years ago allowing the briefest glimpse possible of her body,"" wrote The Arts Desk's Matt Wolf. The actress may not ""strip physically"", observed Mark Shenton in The Stage, ""but the emotional layers are gradually exposed no less revealingly. ""Star power may have brought this play to the West End, but Nicole Kidman proves that she's worthy of the showcase."" ""Kidman beautifully captures the prickly defensiveness, the lonely dedication and the suppressed emotional longings of the scientist,"" wrote The Independent's Paul Taylor, who praised her ""compelling and subtle"" performance. Yet while Neil Norman found Kidman ""never less than watchable"", the Daily Express critic said the evening was ""let down by Michael Grandage's spectacularly unimaginative direction"". ""If ever a production was crying out for some technical flair in the design, this is it,"" he continued. Writing in the Hollywood Reporter, Stephen Dalton observed that Photograph 51 ""is already heavily booked for much of its three-month run"". It is, he suggested, ""a testament to celebrity power more than to strong writing or great directing"", calling Grandage's production ""a worthy effort but a little passionless"".","Actress Nicole Kidman has been hailed by critics as ""luminous"" and ""compelling"" in her return to the London stage in the play Photograph 51."
"The baby, who has not been named, was attacked at a property in Morning Star Road, Daventry, last Friday and was pronounced dead at hospital. Her grandmother, who was caring for her, was injured trying to protect her. A serious case review committee is to meet next month to consider if Northamptonshire's Safeguarding Children Board should investigate. In a statement, the baby's family said: ""We are totally devastated and in complete shock for the tragic loss of our little princess."" The dog was destroyed by vets at the scene and its breed was confirmed at a post-mortem carried out at the Royal Veterinary College. ""The dog was an American pit bull, a prohibited breed under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act,"" Chief Inspector Tom Thompson said. 'Horrific circumstances' Northamptonshire Police said they had drawn on national expertise in the area of dangerous dogs in its investigation. ""But at the heart of it is a baby girl whose life has tragically been taken away in the most horrific of circumstances,"" a spokesman said. ""In addition to our ongoing investigation, we have been concentrating our efforts on providing support for a grieving family."" An inquest will be formally opened by the Northamptonshire Coroner on Wednesday 15 October. Daventry District Council said it received a noise complaint in May about two dogs barking at the house and spoke to the owner ""who acted to control the noise"". The Conservative leader of the council, Chris Millar, told BBC Look East a sound monitoring device had been installed and was in place for a ""number of months"".","The dog that killed a six-month-old girl in Northamptonshire was an illegal American pit bull, say police."
"""Town teams"" in areas including Liskeard and Newbiggin-by-the-Sea will try out ideas proposed by retail guru Mary Portas in her High Street review. Portas, who will make a TV programme about the 12, said she was ""deeply touched"" by the ""creativity"" of bids. Fifteen more ""Portas pilot"" areas will be selected later this year. ""It is now clearer to me than ever that Britain wants its town centres revitalised and the energy and accountability for that needs to rest with the people who live and do business there,"" Portas said. Minister of State for Communities and Local Government Grant Shapps, meanwhile, said the competition had ""captured the imagination of the nation with communities across the country uniting to support their High Streets"". He said ""the winners are going to get the focus and attention from Mary Portas herself and from me as the government minister"". Portas - star of TV shows such as Mary Queen of Shops - would meet all the winning bidders and, along with his department, offer advice, Mr Shapps added. He said the High Street must work hard to compete with out-of-town shopping centres and the internet. ""To make towns work, they're going to have to offer something different and interesting, something that the internet can't provide. ""That's obviously human contact - a place to go and meet, a place where there are other interesting activities other than just shopping."" Michael Weedon, deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was much work to be done. ""This is money being given to twelve out of 371 towns that applied to it, this is not going to be a magic bullet for solving this and we must remember that it's a pilot. ""This is about trying something out to achieve something and you have to be positive about this. They have to approach it positively to try and make a change."" Bedford, in Bedfordshire, Croydon, in London, and Bedminster, in Bristol, as well as Dartford and Margate - both in Kent - were also among successful towns chosen from more than 370 applications. Market Rasen, in Lincolnshire, Nelson, in Lancashire, Stockport, in Greater Manchester, Stockton-on-Tees, in County Durham, and Wolverhampton, in the West Midlands, have also been selected. The introduction of a young person's cafe, sports activities and an art and vintage market in Nelson as well as a ""school for shopkeepers"" in Dartford are among examples of how different towns aim to put money to use. The Wolverhampton town team will stage a Dragons' Den-style competition for local entrepreneurs while a creative arts complex, outdoor screening and new parking strategy are planned for Stockport. The successful towns will also receive support and advice from Ms Portas and other retail experts. The deadline for the next round of pilot applications from town teams - made up of councillors, landlords, business owners and MPs - is 30 June. In March, the government announced it had accepted ""virtually all"" 28 recommendations made in the report it commissioned from Portas on how best to revive the High Street. They included making parking more affordable and disincentives for landlords who left shops empty.",Twelve English High Streets - from Cornwall to Northumberland - will share a £1.2m pot of government cash to rejuvenate shopping areas.
"Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, which she denies. Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have been accused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family have issued a statement about her condition, saying she had been ""complaining of sharp stabbing pains in her breasts"" for more than a year. Breast cancer history They said she had been given a mammogram by the prison's gynaecologist, which gave an inconclusive result. After insisting on seeing an outside specialist, the family said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was then taken to hospital for an ultrasound on Saturday. They said although the doctor thought the lumps were likely to be benign, he did note her family having a history of breast cancer. She was given anti-inflammatory medication and vitamin pills and was to be seen by the specialist again next week to see whether there was any improvement or whether she might need surgery, the family said. The full details of the allegations against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have never been made fully public. She maintains the purpose of her trip to Iran was to visit family and for her daughter to meet her grandparents but speaking in Westminster on 1 November, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared to contradict her account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists there. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and his remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears her five-year sentence could be extended. However, her family say there have been no developments on new charges against her since her court appearance. Her lawyer also says he has not been contacted by the Iranian judiciary. In the statement her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, describes his earlier phone conversation with Mr Johnson and says the minister is trying to find time to meet him ""in the next few days"". It came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran when she was arrested. He later said he would ""take her husband's assurance"" that she was on holiday. Amid calls for his resignation over the matter, the foreign secretary earlier this week clarified that the UK government had ""no doubt"" that a holiday was the sole purpose of her visit to Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been angered by Mr Johnson's initial remarks and Iranian media coverage of her case.

"It comes after the first refugees admitted to the UK since the government announced it was expanding its protection scheme arrived on Tuesday. The LGA warned councils still did not know how the scheme would work, nor what financial support they would get. However, the Home Office said it was working closely with local authorities. Earlier this month, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to take 20,000 Syrians living in camps bordering Syria by 2020. Mr Cameron said the scheme would be funded for the first 12 months by the government. 'Unfair burden' The LGA - which represents more than 370 local authorities in England and Wales - urged clarity on details, including how the scheme would be funded. ""We are pressing the government on exactly how the scheme will operate,"" said David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's refugee task group. ""We need to know who is arriving and when in order to ensure that we have the right homes, school places, and other support that may be required. ""There are a number of issues that need to be urgently resolved, in particular the need for a firm commitment that councils resettling refugees will receive full financial support, in order that it is not seen later as an unfair burden on communities that open their doors."" The Home Office insisted detailed information about individual refugees had been shared and it was working closely with the UN refugee agency and local authorities. What happens when refugees arrive? Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Once someone has been identified and approved, they have full legal rights to settle in the UK for five years - and for the first months, they will be accompanied every step of the way into their new life. When they arrive in the UK, they are met at the airport by a welcome team who take them to their new home. And the next morning, their personalised integration plan begins. Just like anyone else, they can work and claim benefits. Everything about life in the UK is explained to them in briefings and classes. School places are ready for their children, there is a GP already set up to take them on and, where necessary, specialists to work on their long-term health problems. There are trips to the job centre and colleges for those ready to go back to work or study. What awaits refugees arriving in the UK? Under the VPR scheme, the refugees will be granted five years' humanitarian protection, which includes access to public funds and the labour market, as well as the possibility of family reunion, if a person was split up from their partner or child when leaving their country. After that period they can apply to settle in the UK. Eventually the UK will have to take about 400 refugees a month in order to meet its 20,000 target by 2020. Those being resettled will come from camps in countries neighbouring Syria and will be selected by the UN on the basis of need. Britain has been under pressure to take in more people as Europe struggles to deal with a huge influx of refugees. Syrian refugees in the UK 20,000 more refugees will be resettled in the UK by 2020 4,980 Syrian asylum seekers have been allowed to stay since 2011 25,771 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to end June 2015 2,204 were from Syria 87% of Syrian requests for asylum were granted 145 Syrian asylum seekers have been removed from the UK since 2011 Are you a Syrian in the UK?

"By BBC NewsStaff The Sun says he urged the nation to take a well-earned break from Brexit, and welcomes his comments with the headline ""Brexcellent"".

"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The backstop is the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and European Union, designed to ensure that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. Both sides say they hope it never has to come into effect and that it will become redundant because of a wider trade deal. While Irish sources describe Tuesday's phone call between Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson as ""warm and friendly"" on ""both a personal and a political level"", that description is bound to raise an eyebrow given the widening gap between the two capitals. Especially after what the prime minister has been saying about the need to bin the backstop as a precondition to get into Brexit negotiations and to avoid a no-deal exit. Irish sources insist Dublin has not come under any EU pressure to relent on the backstop, with one source describing as ""codswallop"" suggestions otherwise. Another says this isn't the first time there have been inaccurate reports in the British media that pressure is mounting on Dublin. The sources agree that what Mr Johnson is doing, in calling for the binning of the backstop as a first step to allow negotiations, is taking any pressure off Dublin that may have been forthcoming down the line. That's because after the lengthy negotiations that went into the withdrawal agreement to accommodate the British red lines, the EU-27 are not going to suddenly offer Boris Johnson a substantially better deal than the one they gave Theresa May. Another official says the British government's attitude ""is consistent with several of their fundamental misconceptions; such as the EU needs us more than we need them; the damage of a no-deal Brexit is symmetric and affects the EU and the UK both equally: that German car manufacturers will put pressure on Angela Merkel and Ireland is so small it won't be able to withstand pressure"". Compromise? The Irish authorities have published a number of reports which highlight how drastic a no-deal Brexit would be be for the Republic. The governments summer economic statement suggested there could be 55,000 fewer jobs and a 3% drop in growth. If and when serious talks start in a few weeks time, Fergus Finlay, a newspaper columnist with the Irish Examiner who has experience as an Irish official of negotiations with the British on Northern Ireland, says ""until a compromise is visible, there must be no compromise"". He says the Irish government has ""not been guilty of any triumphalism"", but is seeking to defend its interests and those of Northern Ireland. There have also been mutterings in the British media that Leo Varadkar is coming under domestic political pressure to alter his government's position on the backstop. That is simply not the case. The taoiseach leads a minority government that is dependent on the support of the main opposition party in a confidence and supply arrangement. Indeed, there is a widespread consensus in the Dáil (lower house of parliament) that the government must hold the line on the backstop to prevent a hard border and to protect the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that helped to bring about peace on the island. But there is also a view among a minority of commentators that Dublin is not cognisant enough of UK sensitivities and political needs. They argue that the backstop designed to avoid a hard border might result in that very eventuality if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Ministers and officials in Dublin suspect that the prime minister may be more interested in an early general election, than in making the necessary compromises to reach a deal to allow the UK leave the EU on 31 October. They, like everybody else, are keeping an eye on the evolving parliamentary arithmetic at Westminster. And although Boris Johnson has only been a short time in his new job, the next few weeks and months promise to be very interesting and uncertain as bluffs have to be eventually called by all sides.","There is a weary sense of ""here we go again"" among Irish government officials dealing with Brexit about briefings coming from London that Dublin is under pressure from other EU members about the backstop to avoid a no-deal Brexit."

"The circular structure at Star Carr near Scarborough was found in 2008 and dates from 8,500BC. Archaeologists from the Universities of Manchester and York say the site is deteriorating due to environmental changes. The European Research Council has given them £1.23m to finish the work before information from the site is lost. Time running out Nicky Milner, an archaeologist from the University of York, said the site was deteriorating rapidly. ""The water table has fallen and the peat is shrinking and it is severely damaging the archaeology,"" she said. ""The water keeps the oxygen and bacteria out and because they are now going into these deposits that is causing a lot of problems. ""We haven't got much time left to excavate and we want to do some specialist analysis before all this important information vanishes forever."" The site was first discovered in the 1940s and has since been the subject of extensive research. The latest excavation led to the discovery of what would have been a 3.5 metre diameter house occupied by hunter gatherers about 11,000 years ago. The remains were dated by radio carbon and the type of tools used helped identify the house as being from 8,500BC. Large settlement The discovery suggested that people from this era were more attached to settlements than had been previously thought. Items such as the paddle of a boat, arrow tips, masks made from red deer skulls, and antler head-dresses which could have been used in rituals, have all been uncovered. Dr Milner said: ""What we have here is a massive site, we have structures and we have a timber platform on the edge of what would have been a lake. This suggests that people were living here for quite a long period, for generations, in a large group. ""We have to do more excavation to understand more."" Star Carr would have been settled at the end of the last Ice Age and the team believes it may also offer insights into how people reacted to climate change.",Archaeologists excavating what they claim is Britain's oldest house have secured more than £1m in funding.
"The Criminal Bar Association decided to persist after the first day of action, which included not taking on new work. Solicitors have refused to take on new legal aid work since 1 July in protest over an 8.75% cut to their fees. But last week they scaled back their action to cover crown court cases only after meeting the justice secretary. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA), which narrowly voted to back the action two weeks ago., decided at a meeting on Monday night to continue its action, which also includes not covering for colleagues at short notice. ""We will continue to monitor the impact of the action nationally and the CBA will review matters on a weekly basis,"" a spokesman said. 'Going too far' BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the legal profession, which is split between barristers and solicitors, had not found it easy to take sustained and unified action against legal aid cuts. Francis FitzGibbon QC, who will soon become vice chairman of the CBA, told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We feel that the sector is being cut to the bone and there's no fat left on it. Frontline services of those who represent not just defendants, but those who appear on both sides in criminal cases, have been pushed to the limit."" The decision to take action had not been taken lightly, he said, but barristers felt it was in the public interest. ""This isn't about barristers wanting more pay. This is about them supporting action which is designed to show the government that it's in danger of going too far with its cuts,"" he added. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""The changes we are making to criminal legal aid are designed to deliver value for money to taxpayers and do not impact on the availability of high quality legal advice to those who need it most. ""Although we recognise that the transition will be challenging for lawyers, these changes will put the profession on a sustainable footing for the long-term. ""We have already pledged that an independent review looking at the impact of the new arrangements will begin in July 2016.""",Criminal barristers in England and Wales will continue their industrial action in support of solicitors who are protesting against cuts to legal aid.

"Katya AdlerEurope editor@BBCkatyaadleron Twitter But rather than focusing my mind on external threats, his comments got me thinking about all the internal battles the EU is facing. The notion behind a common foreign policy, never mind a joint military, is for the EU to speak with one forceful voice on the world stage. But the 28-member bloc is currently a cacophony of fractious squabbling: over how to deal with Russia, how to battle illegal immigration, how to face off the prospect of deflation and of course, how to handle Greece... to cite just a few of the divisions. Greek farce Greece and its woes were at the top of the agenda at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Monday. Greece's outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has just darkened storm clouds even further by threatening to hold a referendum if the Greek government's reform programme is now rejected. Defence Minister Panos Kammenos went so far as to rage that Greece would then ""flood"" Europe with refugees, including potential Islamic State members. President Juncker's Commission hasn't helped smooth the choppy EU waters much either. While tiny Greece believes it's being sacrificed on the altar of the German austerity model, the EU Commission recently let influential EU members France and Italy off the hook again for not sticking to budget deficit rules. Their finances cannot be compared directly to Greece, but the incident served to heighten tensions, a feeling of injustice and suspicions of divergent visions inside the EU. The army card Forming an EU army is not a new proposal. And every time it resurfaces, it is quashed almost immediately. Note the swift rejection by the British government. Perhaps, in making headlines with EU army talk, Mr Juncker is following in the time-honoured tradition favoured by world leaders of trying to divert attention abroad when all is not well at home. It's an extremely useful tool. President Francois Hollande, for example, has suffered the worst popularity ratings on record of any French leader. He is well known for making big gestures on the world stage, such as recently standing alongside Germany to work out the Minsk ceasefire agreement on Ukraine with Russia. However, speaking with one voice will never come easy to 28 very different nation states.",European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has caused quite a stir by recycling the idea of forming an EU army .
"David Gregory-KumarScience, Environment & Rural Affairs Correspondent The aim is to learn more about the behaviour of a species that experts say could cause millions of pounds of damage to crops if left untreated. Usually, if you want to study an animal, you do a survey and count it. The problem with slugs is you can't always see them as they spend much of their time out of sight in the top 10cm (4in) of the ground. But improved tracking technology will allow scientists to accurately follow slug movements for the first time. The aim of the research is to answer an interesting problem facing farmers: how do slugs live amongst their crops? The researchers at Harper Adams University have a theory slugs are not evenly distributed over a field. Instead they believe they are concentrated in patches. That's important because if the scientists could help farmers find these large patches of slugs you could target them with pest control measures. That would be cheaper and greener than spreading chemicals over an entire field. Slug-detectorists Slugs are slimy and enjoy squeezing into tight spaces so the trackers need to be placed inside the slugs themselves just under the skin. The slugs are anaesthetised before a small cut is made in the skin and the tracker inserted. The tracker itself is smaller than a grain of rice. The slugs I saw were implanted a month ago and seemed happy. It's important to the researchers that the trackers don't cause the slugs to behave any differently to their non-implanted cousins. In the lab it appears neither slug movement or appetite is affected. Tracking the slugs involves equipment that looks very like a metal detector. Researchers will go out at night when the slugs are most active and release the slugs with the trackers. There will be hundreds of them over the duration of the experiment. Then every 20 minutes throughout the night the team will scan the fields with the detector. This will automatically log the slug's individual tracker number and it's GPS location building up a very accurate map of where the slugs go and what they are doing. Lost. One slug. There's increasing pressure on farmers to reduce the chemicals they use against slugs and some are being banned outright. So if this research comes up with a better way to control them by revealing more about their behaviour it could be very useful. Funding for this study has come from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), The Potato Council and Cereals and Oilseeds who estimate that slugs could cause £100m of damage to UK crops if they aren't properly controlled. And finally a confession. We did take a slug out into the field and we put it down on the ground to track it. We certainly managed to find it again, the signal from its tracker was loud and strong, but we couldn't actually see it. Which means we couldn't recover the slug and he had to go and join his colleagues in the soil. It did rather show how trackers beat traditional visual slug surveys. And soon our slug implanted with a tracker will be joined by hundreds more. Update: One week on and our slug was safely recovered by the team.",At Harper Adams University they are fitting tracking devices to slugs.
"The 25-year-old made the announcement on Twitter saying she wanted to concentrate on promoting her new album and touring around the world.

""I shall be keeping a very close eye on series three, showing my support in every way I can, and really hope that in some way that I can be part of the show.""

"The social network's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg confirmed the decision to retain Peter Thiel during her appearance at the Code Conference. Mr Thiel has said he wants to challenge Gawker's ""bullying"" behaviour. But he has been criticised for using his wealth to try and silence part of the media. That poses a potential issue for Facebook at a time when it is trying to convince parts of the industry to host articles on its platform, provide it with exclusive video content and allow the tech firm to sell advertising on their behalf. ""Peter did what he did on his own, not as a Facebook board member,"" Ms Sandberg told attendees at the California event. ""We have very independent board members with very independent thoughts that they share publicly. Those strong people make really good board members because they have strong views and they're not afraid to think differently than other people, which has served Facebook well."" But one expert questioned whether the decision to keep on Mr Thiel - who was one of Facebook's early investors - was sustainable in the long-term. ""Facebook has always fundamentally seen itself as a technology company, but is now having to deal with the public position - and also the ethics and responsibilities - of being a publisher,"" media consultant Steve Hewlett told the BBC. ""Imagine that this person were sitting on the board of The Times or the BBC - that would look like an obvious conflict of interest. You can't have a billionaire sitting on a publisher's board who is suing other people for publishing things. ""So, if you think of Facebook as being a publisher, this is plainly problematic."" 'Philanthropic' attack The clash between Gawker and Mr Thiel dates back to 2007, when the media firm published an article headlined: ""Peter Thiel is totally gay people"". Last week, the venture capitalist revealed to the New York Times that he had subsequently funded a team of lawyers to find and help ""victims"" of other Gawker articles sue the firm - an act he described as ""philanthropic"". One case resulted in a jury ordering Gawker to pay Hulk Hogan $140m (£97m) after it decided the publication of a sex tape featuring the ex-professional wrestler amounted to an invasion of privacy. Gawker is appealing against the ruling, which threatens its future. The publisher has also challenged Mr Thiel's involvement and questioned his continued role at the social network. ""As a Facebook board member, how have your own views on politics and news influenced your contribution to corporate decisions?"" asked Gawker's founder Nick Denton in an open letter. 'Seeking revenge' Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post newspaper, was critical of Mr Thiel earlier in the week during his own appearance at the Code Conference. ""I don't think a billionaire should be able to fund a lawsuit to kill Gawker,"" he said. ""Seek revenge and you dig two graves. One for yourself."" Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg rebuked one of its other directors, Marc Andreessen, earlier in the year for criticising India's action against the firm's Free Basics scheme. But Ms Sandberg said the circumstances involving Mr Thiel were different. ""[In the earlier case] it almost felt like he was speaking for Facebook,"" she explained. Even so, one company watcher suggested Ms Sandberg's comments were unlikely to end the matter. ""Media critics clearly see Thiel's actions as a threat to free speech, if not the entire news business,"" said Graham Lovelace from Lovelace Consulting. ""Some are trying to bring Facebook into that, because of its record in championing free expression. ""It highlights the debate around Facebook's identity as it continues to grow."" Shareholders in the social network have an opportunity to question its decision at its annual stockholder meeting on 20 June.",Facebook has chosen to keep the billionaire who helped fund a sex tape legal case against Gawker Media on its board of directors.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent A host of businesses closed or faced significant losses, so made claims on their business interruption insurance. But many insurers disputed the claims, arguing policies were never meant to cover such unprecedented restrictions. Supreme Court judges will make a final judgement after the hearing, which is expected to last four days. The issue will have had implications for 370,000 - mostly small - businesses, and involves potential payouts of £1.2bn. High Court judges earlier found mostly in favour of insurers having to pay out to policyholders regarding a selection of policy types. Some of these decisions are now being appealed against at the Supreme Court. What is the case about? Many thousands of businesses could not operate during the first national lockdown because, for example, they were unable to enter their premises. It meant some went out of business. Others - like Anna and Robin Smart's photography studio in Oxfordshire - had to downsize, make staff redundant, or relocate. The Smarts moved their studio into their back garden and said the whole situation caused ""immense stress"". They, like others, looked to their insurer for compensation via their business interruption insurance policies. Some businesses paid premiums of many thousands of pounds a year for such cover. Some insurers refused to pay out, in some cases because they said disease clauses in contracts did not cover such a scenario. What has happened so far? The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, brought a test case with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. This went to the High Court, where judges found that most, but not all, of the policies involved should pay out offering a potential lifeline to many of these small businesses. But many have still had to wait while the proceedings were fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court. What will the Supreme Court be looking at? The High Court looked at 21 policy types as part of a test case, and rulings on 13 have been appealed against. These will be discussed in complex legal arguments over four days at the Supreme Court. Of these, the lower court said 11 should have led to payouts - decisions now being appealed against by insurers. Judges said two should not pay out, and these are the subject of appeal by the FCA. For two insurers, Zurich and Ecclesiastical, the judgement found entirely in their favour and the FCA decided not to appeal against the findings. The final ruling by the Supreme Court judges will provide authoritative guidance for the other policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. For example, the Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. When will there be a conclusion? The Supreme Court will give judgement some weeks after next week's hearing. The FCA will expect insurers to respond quickly to the final judgement, if the result means they are required to do so. Many businesses will have renewed annual policies since the first lockdown began and these will have Covid exclusions, so claims are mostly relevant for older policies during the first UK lockdown.

"Few countries choreograph their political drama quite like North Korea. And after surviving for months on scraps of news and hearsay about the regime, analysts of the country's politics have been thrown a juicy steak. Almost overnight, Chang Song-thaek morphed from uncle and mentor to North Korea's young leader to ""anti-revolutionary"" criminal outcast. He was stripped of all official positions, edited out of official documentary footage, and his forcible removal from a party meeting, as well as his long list of alleged misdeeds and character faults, were broadcast on state media. The detail of those charges alone startled many people; the report on North Korea's state news agency ran to several pages. ""It's unique,"" an official at South Korea's Unification Ministry said. ""We haven't seen this kind of official announcement in the past - the very detailed explanation seems like an attempt to provide legitimacy for its decision."" 'John the Baptist' Chief among Mr Chang's charges: that he had challenged his country's leadership, arrogated control of economic, judicial and security affairs to himself, and tried to form his own rival faction within the ruling Workers' Party. It is the biggest political shake-up since the death of the country's former ruler Kim Jong-il two years ago. But North Korea's political reporting of itself is rarely transparent, so what might this unusual glimpse through the looking glass actually mean? Some analysts believe it could signal restlessness within the ruling elite. As news first surfaced of Mr Chang's purge, Professor Victor Cha of Georgetown University warned that ""there is a great deal more churn inside the North Korean system than is popularly depicted in the media, even though Kim appears in control"". ""If you have to take out the top people,"" he says, ""that's usually a sign that things are quite dynamic, because if they were going well, you wouldn't need to."" South Korea's online news site DailyNK, which has sources inside North Korea, believes Mr Chang's removal highlights a rift over how to boost growth in the country, perhaps sparked by China's successful economic reform process. It quotes an unnamed source as saying that Chang Song-thaek ""had been pushing for Chinese-style 'reform and opening', not a partial opening"" as wanted by Kim Jong-un. ""What started with conflict between the two,"" the source says, ""ended in Chang's downfall."" Others, though, believe there is little policy difference among the top levels of government. Dr Paik Haksoon, of Seoul's Sejong Institute, says that if divisions among Pyongyang's elite were serious, the regime would not have publicised them in this way, nor resolved them as quickly. Instead, he says, Mr Chang's expulsion is more a sign that the young Kim Jong-un has outgrown his tutor. ""Chang Song-thaek had finished his role as a bridge between the past and the future,"" he said. ""You can compare him to John the Baptist in the Bible - the man of the Old Testament who played a bridging role for the new era of Jesus Christ."" But that role, in shepherding North Korea's young leader through the transition of power, had unexpected consequences. ""The more people Chang attracted, the more powerful he became, and that was the challenge to Kim Jong-un,"" says Dr Paik. ""Chang Song-thaek was such a big figure in North Korean politics that his removal demanded a long and detailed explanation on why he had to be expelled."" Even so, what is surprising, says Dr John Delury of Yonsei University, is the acknowledgement by North Korea that ""there are members of the Party, and the Kim family - people at the highest levels of government - who are deeply corrupt and disloyal. This level of admission about someone who until a month ago was right next to the leader - it is startling. And also a warning to others."" Read this way, Mr Chang's removal is another sign of Kim Jong-un's authority: the latest in a series of carefully calibrated moves to demonstrate his control, and his independence - from the former army chief, whom he purged last year; from China's leaders, whom he snubbed soon after taking power; and now from his closest advisor and confidante. And that authority is being demonstrated, not just to a domestic audience, but an international one as well. 'Important barometer' What is striking, says John Delury, is the speed with which North Korea got control of the story. ""They very quickly went public with their version of what's happened to Chang Song-thaek,"" he said. ""In some ways, we can link this to new developments in North Korea's relationship with the world: they have a Twitter account, they put out videos on YouTube, they're much more integrated into the global conversation, and when they become the centre of that conversation, they pro-actively get their side of the story told."" But even with such a rare level of official detail around Mr Chang's removal from power, it is never easy to pin down the truth of what is actually going on. ""North Korea's official announcements are a very important barometer for us,"" an official at South Korea's Unification Ministry said, ""and there are certain keywords within them that we pay particular attention to. But we also have other channels - official and unofficial - that we try to gather information from."" Other sources, though, can be equally problematic. ""The study of North Korea tends to be dominated by political organisations, governments, intelligence organisations, think-tanks,"" says John Delury. ""And the North Korean sources themselves - whether government or defectors - tend to have very intense agendas."" He says that as a result of this lack of clear information, experts ""tend to come up with a framework - you sort of have to. You start to fit facts to your framework and it becomes very hard to let go of it, and then you start missing things."" Haksoon Paik agrees that context is everything. And taking a stance - for example, by writing a newspaper column - is a risky business. ""It could improve my image or destroy it!"" he says. But in the end, ""when there are conflicting interpretations, you have to use your judgement"". And the long years of watching North Korea's state media do gradually bestow a cumulative kind of insight, he says. One of the reasons Dr Paik believes Kim Jong-un is so firmly entrenched in his position is the experience of watching him on television, from the moment of his accession until now. ""At first he wasn't very natural,"" he says. ""He was quite awkward sometimes. But as time passed by, he was clearly enjoying his status. I remember one occasion, a few months after he took power, when he was delivering some 'on-the-spot guidance', with Chang Song-thaek beside him. Kim Jong-un turned suddenly towards his uncle, and Chang stiffened immediately in response, just like soldiers do with their generals. It was such a natural reaction, and I was rather shocked."" Rare moments like these are perhaps the closest we'll come, at least for now, to observing directly the workings of the North Korean state. Glimpses through the curtain of North Korean propaganda; fingered lovingly like prayer-beads, year after year, by those watching from outside.","North Korea's second most powerful figure has been executed, days after being purged from the country's ruling elite. State media said Chang Song-thaek had pleaded guilty to challenging the leadership of Kim Jong-un and forming a rival faction within the Workers' Party. He had already been stripped of all his official positions and expelled from the party, but what does his very public expulsion say about the stability of North Korea's opaque political machine, asks the BBC's Lucy Williamson."
"The search giant has been under scrutiny for collecting wi-fi data as part of its StreetView project. Google has released an independent audit of the rogue code, which it has claimed was included in the StreetView software by mistake. But PI is convinced the audit proves ""criminal intent"". ""The independent audit of the Google system shows that the system used for the wi-fi collection intentionally separated out unencrypted content (payload data) of communications and systematically wrote this data to hard drives. This is equivalent to placing a hard tap and a digital recorder onto a phone wire without consent or authorisation,"" said PI in a statement. This would put Google at odds with the interception laws of the 30 countries that the system was used in, it added. Scotland Yard ""The Germans are almost certain to prosecute. Because there was intent, they have no choice but to prosecute,"" said Simon Davies, head of PI. In the UK the ICO has said it is reviewing the audit but that for the time being it had no plans to pursue the matter. PI however does intend to take the case to the police. ""I don't see any alternative but for us to go to Scotland Yard,"" said Mr Davies. The revelation that Google had collected such data led the German Information Commissioner to demand it handed over a hard-disk so it could examine exactly what it had collected. It has not yet received the data and has extended the original deadline for it to be handed over. The Australian police have also been ordered to investigate Google for possible breach of privacy. 'Systematic failure' According to Google, the code which allowed data to be collected was part of an experimental wi-fi project undertaken by an unnamed engineer to improve location-based services and was never intended to be incorporated in the software for StreetView. ""As we have said before, this was a mistake. The report today confirms that Google did indeed collect and store payload data from unencrypted wi-fi networks, but not from networks that were encrypted. We are continuing to work with the relevant authorities to respond to their questions and concerns,"" said a Google spokesman. ""This was a failure of communication between and within teams,"" he added. But PI disputes this explanation. ""The idea that this was a work of a lone engineer doesn't add up. This is complex code and it must have been given a budget and been overseen. Google has asserted that all its projects are rigorously checked,"" said Mr Davies. ""It goes to the heart of a systematic failure of management and of duty of care,"" he added.","Google is ""almost certain"" to face prosecution for collecting data from unsecured wi-fi networks, according to Privacy International (PI)."
"The energy provider said Friday's lack of coal usage was a ""watershed"" moment. Britain's previous longest continuous energy period without coal until now was 19 hours - first achieved last May, and again on Thursday. The government plans to phase out Britain's last plants by 2025 in order to cut carbon emissions. Friday is thought to be the first time the nation has not used coal to generate electricity since the world's first centralised public coal-fired generator opened in 1882, at Holborn Viaduct in London. Cordi O'Hara, of the National Grid, described Friday as ""a watershed moment in how our energy system is changing"". She added: ""The UK benefits from highly diverse and flexible sources of electricity. Our energy mix continues to change and National Grid adapts system operation to embrace these changes."" But Ms O'Hara says that while the country makes the transition to a low carbon system, coal remains an important source of energy. According to Gridwatch.co.uk, around half of British energy on Friday came from natural gas, with about a quarter coming from nuclear plants. Wind, biomass, and imported energy were also used. Analysis By John Moylan, BBC industry correspondent Coal has powered Britain for more than a century. But Friday's landmark moment - the first 24-hour period without any coal-powered generation - is a sign of how the once mighty fuel is being consigned to history. Part of the reason is that solar panels and wind turbines now provide much more electricity to factories and homes. Lower power demand is a factor too - that's normal on a Friday. And as older, uneconomic coal fired plants have closed in recent years, the fossil fuel has been playing a much smaller role in our energy system. The last deep coal mine in the UK, Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire, closed in December 2015, bringing to an end centuries of deep coal mining in Britain. Hannah Martin, from Greenpeace UK, said: ""A decade ago, a day without coal would have been unimaginable, and in 10 years' time our energy system will have radically transformed again."" Coal remained a dominant part of the energy supply until the 1990s, but its use has fallen in recent years, as plants closed or switched to burning biomass such as wood pellets. It accounted for just 9% of electricity generation in 2016 - down from 23% the year before. However, there have been claims that using wood pellets to generate electricity is actually speeding up, not slowing down, climate warming. A study published by Chatham House in February said wood is not carbon neutral and emissions from pellets are higher than coal, making pellet use a flawed policy. The energy industry rejected the report, saying that wood energy cuts carbon significantly compared with fossil fuels.

"As courtroom dramas go, this one veered wildly between suspense, tragedy, farce and black comedy. Early in the hearing, one of the accused, Ramzi Binalshibh, got up from his chair and began to pray. ""When detainees stand up, the guards get excited,"" observed the judge, Col James Pohl, with studied understatement. Proceedings were interrupted for several minutes as the defendant continued his prayer, kneeling on the courtroom floor. Another alleged terrorist, Waleed bin Attash, had begun the day restrained in his chair. ""Can I assume he was not coming here voluntarily today?"" asked Judge Pohl drily. With the defendant apparently in discomfort and unable to reach his headphones, his defence lawyer offered a guarantee. ""He has assured me he will not misbehave if the restraints are removed,"" explained Captain Michael Schwartz. The judge concurred. Testing the limits Before long, however, it was clear that none of the accused was wearing the court-supplied headphones providing simultaneous Arabic translation. After a recess, the judge accepted the prosecution's offer to bring an interpreter physically into the court, to relay proceedings aloud in Arabic. ""We'll have to do this in bite-sized chunks,"" Judge Pohl advised. Therein followed several hours of painfully slow legal back-and-forth. First, over whether the defendants recognised their court-appointed defence lawyers. Next, whether civilian lawyers were suitably prepared to assist to the defence, in a military case that could carry the death penalty. And finally, over whether Judge Pohl was sufficiently removed from the events of 9/11 to oversee the biggest terror trial of our times. He was asked by defence lawyers to confirm that none of his family had been killed or injured in the attacks. At one point during the morning, the video feed to watching reporters was briefly cut, as the hearing took a turn towards matters considered sensitive or classified. Such interruptions have been strongly challenged by the defence and human rights groups, who call them censorship. When the feed resumed, we were given clues as to what had transpired. ""The warning light went off because the word 'torture' was used,"" observed David Nevin, the civilian lawyer for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. ""I'm trying to work out where the line is,"" observed Captain Schwartz, the lawyer for Waleed bin Attash. He added wryly that it appeared as if the line was drawn at ""embarrassing for the government"". Tiny acts of resistance All of which presents the defendants with a problem. If, as appears to be the case, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wants to argue that this entire process lacks legitimacy because he was water-boarded before being brought to Guantanamo, he will want the world to know about it. But unless the rules are changed, the details may never become public. The alleged mastermind of 11 September spent much of the day hunched over a desk, looking older than his 47 years. His silent defiance was a far cry from past theatrics here. In previous appearances he had boasted of having plotted 9/11 ""from A to Z,"" proclaimed that he wished to die a martyr, and even ordered a court sketch artist to redraw his nose. This time, acts of resistance were small and presented through lawyers. David Nevin, representing Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, complained that his client had not been allowed to wear the clothes he had brought for him. Instead, the Guantanamo authorities had stripped-searched the defendants, then supplied them with white Pakistani-style dress. Virtually all the defence lawyers chipped in with criticism, collectively implying that the enforced dress code was a control tactic. Long after night fell, the session ended with a formal reading of the charge sheet, which details the steps these men allegedly took to plan mass murder. It also lists the 2,976 people killed on 11 September 2001, some of whom had relatives watching in court. Several had told me they were here to bear witness to justice. But even if this court is to offer closure, on this day's evidence it will be a long time coming.","The first Guantanamo hearing for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused over the 9/11 attacks turned into a series of disputes between defendants, lawyers and the court, writes the BBC's Steve Kingstone."
"""[It] will bring together some of Europe's best brains in the field of cybercrime,"" said Cecilia Malmstrom, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, at a press conference in Brussels. Based in The Hague, it will be housed alongside Europol, the pan-European police force. The plan is for the centre to be up and running by January 2013. It will be primarily focused on fighting credit card and bank fraud. ""As the e-economy grows at a fast pace, cybercrime is following suit,"" said Ms Malmstrom. Cyber counter-attack More than a third of the EU's 500 million citizens bank online, and an estimated $8tn (£5tn) changes hands globally each year in e-commerce, according to the Commission. While acknowledging it is hard to put a figure on the total cost of cybercrime, Ms Malmstrom cited one study that estimated it to be $388bn a year worldwide. ""Up to 600,000 Facebook accounts are blocked every day, after various types of hacking attempts,"" she said. ""In 2009, over 6.7m distinct bot infected computers were detected."" The centre will provide logistical support for investigations and become a ""focal point"" for European-wide initiatives, Ms Malmstrom added. Apart from its remit to fight fraud, the centre will also pay attention to social networks, online child sexual exploitation and cyber-attacks affecting ""critical infrastructures"". However, the Commission said its remit would not extend to pursuing individual file sharers.",The European Commission has announced plans to set up a dedicated centre to fight cybercrime.
"DeepMind, the Alphabet-owned AI firm famous for teaching an AI system to play Go, is attempting to work out how such systems make decisions. By knowing how AI works, it hopes to build smarter systems. But researchers acknowledged that the more complex the system, the harder it might be for humans to understand. The fact that the programmers who build AI systems do not entirely know why the algorithms that power it make the decisions they do, is one of the biggest issues with the technology. It makes some wary of it and leads others to conclude that it may result in out-of-control machines. Complex and counter-intuitive Just as with a human brain, neural networks rely on layers of thousands or millions of tiny connections between neurons, clusters of mathematical computations that act in the same way as the neurons in the brain. These individual neurons combine in complex and often counter-intuitive ways to solve a wide range of challenging tasks. ""This complexity grants neural networks their power but also earns them their reputation as confusing and opaque black boxes,"" wrote the researchers in their paper. According to the research, a neural network designed to recognise pictures of cats will have two different classifications of neurons working in it - interpretable neurons that respond to images of cats and confusing neurons, where it is unclear what they are responding to. To evaluate the relative importance of these two types of neurons, the researchers deleted some to see what effect it would have on network performance. They found that neurons that had no obvious preference for images of cats over pictures of any other animal, play as big a role in the learning process as those clearly responding just to images of cats. They also discovered that networks built on neurons that generalise, rather than simply remembering images they had been previously shown, are more robust. ""Understanding how networks change... will help us to build new networks which memorise less and generalise more,"" the researchers said in a blog. ""We hope to better understand the inner workings of neural networks, and critically, to use this understanding to build more intelligent and general systems,"" they concluded. However, they acknowledged that humans may still not entirely understand AI. DeepMind research scientist Ari Morcos told the BBC: ""As systems become more advanced we will definitely have to develop new techniques to understand them.""","As with the human brain, the neural networks that power artificial intelligence systems are not easy to understand."
"Ipswich Crown Court heard three men were injured when a car struck them in St Helen's Street, Ipswich on 8 March. Witness Brandon Mann said he had been on his way to get food after a night out in the Waterlily pub when a car ""swerved up onto the pavement"". Thomas Broughton, 32, of Woodbridge Road, Ipswich, denies three counts of attempted murder. He also denies driving an Audi A3 dangerously. Mr Mann told the court he had been part of a group of six relatives and friends who had been on a pub crawl. He said after they left the Waterlily pub there was ""some miscommunication"" with another group. ""Two blokes thought we were laughing at them and asked what we were laughing at, and we said nothing,"" he said. He said a scuffle had broken out with the other group, which included Mr Broughton, who had then left. The court heard Mr Mann's group had later been planning to get a kebab when he ""heard a car screeching"". ""The car swerved up onto the pavement,"" he said. ""It happened so quickly. ""My uncle landed next to me. He was bleeding from his mouth."" 'Revving loudly' Colin Mann, who was also in the pub crawl group, told the court as they left the pub ""something was said and Mr Broughton stepped forward. ""He just came over mouthing off, swearing, I told him to go away."" He said a fight had started, and that later he had heard an engine ""revving loudly"" and a car ""coming at a fast speed"". ""It mounted the pavement, I shouted to everyone to get out of the way,"" he said. Under cross-examination, he agreed the first punch was thrown by someone in his group. The trial continues.

"The men had stopped responding to the main treatment options. Researchers found that a small proportion of men, described as ""super responders"", remained well even after the trial ended, despite a very poor prognosis before treatment. Last week it was reported the same drug had proved effective in treating advanced head and neck cancers. What is immunotherapy? Immunotherapy uses our own immune systems to recognise and attack cancer cells. It's already being used as a standard treatment for some cancers such as melanomas - and being tested on many others too. What did the study find? It found that one in 20 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug pembrolizumab - and saw their tumours actually shrink or disappear altogether. Although a relatively small number, some of them gained years of extra life, the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found. A further 19% saw some evidence of improvement. But most patients in the study lived for an average of eight months on the drug. The phase II clinical trial, led by the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden, involved 258 men with advanced prostate cancer who had run out of all other options on treatment. What happens next? The most dramatic responses were seen in patients whose tumours had mutations in genes involved in repairing DNA. Researchers are now investigating whether this group might benefit the most from immunotherapy in a larger trial. But first, a test to pick out who will respond best is needed, so that doctors know which patients to give it to. What is prostate cancer? It's the most common cancer in men in the UK, with around 47,700 diagnosed in the UK each year. The number of people diagnosed has been rising over the last 10 years. This is probably because the population is getting older and more people are having PSA tests. Around 30% of men with advanced or stage 4 prostate cancer survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis. What do experts say? ""Immunotherapy has had tremendous benefits for some cancer patients, and it's fantastic news that even in prostate cancer, where we don't see much immune activity, a proportion of men are responding well to treatment,"" says Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research. ""A limitation with immunotherapy is that there's no good test to pick out those who are most likely to respond. ""It's encouraging to see testing for DNA repair mutations may identify some patients who are more likely to respond, and I'm keen to see how the new, larger trial in this group of patients plays out."" Professor Johann de Bono, a consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, was one of those who led the study. He said: ""We don't see much activity from the immune system in prostate tumours, so many oncologists thought immunotherapy wouldn't work for this cancer type. ""But our study shows that a small proportion of men with end-stage cancer do respond, and crucially that some of these men do very well indeed. ""We found that men with mutations in DNA repair genes respond especially well to immunotherapy, including two of my own patients who have now been on the drug for more than two years."" Last week, a separate trial found the same drug kept some people's advanced head and neck cancers at bay for an average of two years - five times longer than under chemotherapy. Both studies are part of a growing body of research suggesting immunotherapy could offer hope to an increasing number of cancer patients.",A major trial of an immunotherapy drug has shown it can be effective in some men with advanced prostate cancer.
"HP is suing for alleged fraud. Separately, Mr Lynch and the former management of Autonomy plans to sue HP for more than £100m, alleging ""false and negligent statements"". US-based HP bought software firm Autonomy in 2011 for $11bn. HP later wrote down the value of its purchase by three quarters. Industry observers suggested there may have been problems with due diligence before Autonomy was bought. HP purchased Autonomy with the aim of moving more into software. But shortly after buying it, HP claimed it had been misled by Autonomy as to the firm's true value. Earlier this year, the Serious Fraud Office closed its investigation into Autonomy's sale, saying that ""on the information available to it, there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction."" It ceded legal jurisdiction to US authorities. Mr Lynch and Mr Hussain have consistently denied any allegation of impropriety. UK claim HP said in an emailed statement that: ""HP can confirm that, on 30 March, a Claim Form was filed against Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain.

"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News Commuters have been warned of major disruption on the road and rail networks after the ""beast from the east"" brought more snow, with Storm Emma expected to make matters even worse. So if getting to work is impossible, what are your rights? Red weather warning ahead of Storm Emma Do I still get paid? In most cases you are not automatically entitled to pay if you are unable to get to work because of travel disruption or bad weather. But that doesn't necessarily mean you will lose out. If your employer normally provides your travel to work and this has been cancelled because of the bad weather you should still be paid, according to the employment advice and conciliation service Acas. Some jobs may also have a specific clause written into their contracts, or have a collective agreement in place, that an employer will pay you if you cannot get to work due to circumstances beyond your control. Some employers might also make discretionary, informal arrangements. For example, they may let you work from home, or agree that you can make up the missed time at a later date. However, they are not obliged to do this. Can my employer force me to take a day off as holiday? Your employer can ask you to take a day of paid holiday - but only if they give you sufficient warning. The law states that you must be given a warning period of ""at least"" double the length of annual leave you are being asked to take. So, if your employer wants you to take one day's annual leave, for example, they would need to give you two days notice. What if my workplace is closed? In these circumstances, you are entitled to be paid. In addition, your employer cannot require you to take the time as annual leave. But don't rush out to make snow angels or have a snowball fight just yet. Your employer can still ask you to work from home, or ask you to go to another workplace that is open if the business has one, according to government advice website Gov.uk. My child's school is closed due to snow: can I take the day off? Employees have the right to take unpaid time off to deal with emergency situations for their children or other dependants. Lawyers suggest that a school being shut at short notice is likely to be considered an emergency. Strictly, the day would be unpaid but not all employers would take this approach. Acas advises you talk to your employer as soon as you can to explain that you need to take time off and the likely length of the absence. It says one option is that you jointly agree to take the day as annual leave so you do not miss out on pay. My office is freezing - can I go home? Not necessarily. The Health and Safety Executive recommends a minimum temperature of 16C for offices where the work is deskbound and fairly sedentary. If the work requires physical effort, the minimum recommended temperature is 13C. These temperatures are not a legal requirement but your employer has a duty to provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But as anyone who's had a row over the office thermostat knows, what feels reasonable to one person may require another to wear their coat in the office. If low temperatures make it unsafe for workers, then Acas says you should be allowed to wear warmer clothing, take extra breaks to make hot drinks and also be allowed to bring in extra heating options such as portable heaters. However, if you are vulnerable in any way, for example are pregnant, then you may be sent home to protect your health, and this would usually be on full pay.","As heavy snow affects large swathes of the UK, many people are finding it hard to get to work on Thursday."
"By Justin HarperBusiness reporter, BBC News The South Korean car company initially said it was in the ""early stage"" of talks with the iPhone maker about a possible electric car partnership. But hours later it backtracked and said it was talking with a number of potential partners without naming Apple. Hyundai's share price rose more than 20% when the tie-up was announced. ""Apple and Hyundai are in discussions but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,"" it said in a statement which was later revised. Hyundai's value shot up $9bn (£6.5bn) after the Apple announcement. While an updated statement said it was talking to a number of companies about a possible electric car tie-up including Apple, a later version omitted the US tech firm. Apple is known for its secretiveness when it comes to new products and partnerships. ""I'm not surprised to see a big jump in the valuation of Hyundai. The stock market loves car companies who are tech firms as seen with Tesla rise,"" said Sarwant Singh, managing partner at consultants Frost & Sullivan. ""This partnership helps Hyundai be seen as a tech innovator."" Last month, news emerged that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology with a 2024 launch date. The electric vehicle (EV) market is becoming increasingly competitive, with companies such as Tesla grabbing the headlines with its rapidly-increasing valuation. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world, displacing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Experts say an electric vehicle from Apple is still at least five years away. They say pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond. Catching up Hyundai has already been pushing into new technologies such as electric, driverless and flying cars.

"John McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn was ""rightfully"" trying to build consensus, but added the party needed to reach a position ""sooner rather than later"". ""I want to campaign for Remain,"" he said. He also denied he had called for the Labour leader's advisors to be sacked, as reported in the Sunday Times. 'Wiser' Labour had previously promised a vote on Brexit in certain circumstances, specifically if it could not get its own deal with the EU passed by MPs or if there was no general election. Following the party's poor performance in the European elections in May, Mr Corbyn appeared to go further, suggesting there ""had to be a public vote"" on any deal agreed with Brussels. He has recently come under pressure from his own MPs to confirm that the party would call for another referendum, and would campaign to remain in the EU. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr McDonnell confirmed that he, personally, would campaign to Remain if there was a second referendum. He said he wanted to ""get on with it"", but added that Mr Corbyn was ""much wiser"" and wanted to ""build consensus and then go for it"". ""That's what he's doing at the moment,"" he added. ""Jeremy and I go back 40 years, we're the closest of friends. We've minded each other's back throughout that period. Yes, we'll disagree on things, and then we'll come to an agreement."" Asked if he and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott had called for Mr Corbyn's advisors - Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne - to be sacked, Mr McDonnell replied such stories were ""rubbish"". Meanwhile, Labour's Barry Gardiner told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that his party is in talks with Conservative MPs who might support a no-confidence motion in the government in order to stop a no-deal Brexit. Conservative MP and ex-minister Sam Gyimah suggested ""30 plus"" Tory MPs would seek to stop a no-deal Brexit. 'Futile' Mr McDonnell was also asked about reports in the Sunday Times that up to half a dozen Labour staff have ignored non-disclosure agreements (NDA) to speak to BBC journalists working on a Panorama programme about Labour and anti-Semitism. According to the Times, Labour, through the law firm Carter Ruck, has warned there could be legal action against those staff members. Mr McDonnell said the Labour Party was ""reminding them of their confidentiality agreement"". He argued this was important in cases where employees ""are dealing with individual cases, individual information and individual members"". However, he added the party would ""always protect anyone subject to harassment"". A number of Labour MPs criticised the reported action, including deputy leader Tom Watson who said ""using expensive media lawyers in an attempt to silence staff members is as futile as it is stupid"". Labour MP Wes Streeting tweeted ""Labour opposes NDAs, yet seems to impose them. I'm protected by parliamentary privilege. I'll whistleblow in the House of Commons for anyone who needs me to do so. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. No more excuses or hiding places. You should promise the same Jeremy Corbyn."" Mr Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, has attacked the forthcoming Panorama programme - which will be aired next week - as neither balanced or impartial. In response the BBC said: ""The Labour Party is criticising a programme they have not seen. ""We are confident the programme will adhere to the BBC's editorial guidelines.

"By Mark DoyleBBC News, Nalut Shortly after arriving in the town of Nalut, an hour's drive from the Tunisian border, I heard a series of terrifying explosions. A volley of Grad missiles - self-propelled explosive rockets about a metre long - had torn into buildings and smashed into the rocky outcrops that surround Nalut. They were fired by troops loyal to Col Muammar Gaddafi from their positions in the valleys and plains below the Western Mountains, or Jebel Nafusa. On this occasion, no-one was reported hurt. But the basic hospitals of the mountains - and the more sophisticated medical facilities of neighbouring Tunisia - are full of hundreds of injured from the forgotten front. The day before I arrived in Nalut I heard Nato planes circling the area. I later learnt that these Nato planes had attacked a pro-Gaddafi position in Ain Ghezaia, just below the mountain road leading to Nalut. ""We are very pleased with this Nato attack. It has reduced the number of Grad attacks,"" one resident of Nalut said. But - as I discovered - it has not stopped them. 'Painfully young men' Since April, the mainly ethnic Berber rebels have consolidated their hold on a string of towns from the Tunisian border in the far west to within a few hours' drive of Tripoli. But the final drive to the capital - if it comes - will be a fierce battle. The general picture in the Western Mountains is that the rebels hold the high ground, while Col Gaddafi's troops hold the heavy weapons. Most of the Berber rebels, in a loose alliance with the National Transitional Council in Libya's second city, Benghazi, have only small arms - rifles or hand-held machine guns. Some have larger guns mounted on the back of pickups, known as ""technicals"" after their widespread use in Somalia, but these are rare. The rebels count instead on their superior knowledge of the mountains against Col Gaddafi, in much the same way that Libyan nationalists battled the colonial power, Italy, by taking to the high ground. In other battles, the rebels have few advantages against the arsenal of heavy weapons and tanks that Col Gaddafi can deploy. ""We rely on our courage - and on Nato,"" said another man. I watched a group of rebels training in a barracks in Nalut. They were keen and roused their morale with constant shouts of ""Allahu Akhbar"" or renditions of the old Libyan national anthem which Col Gaddafi banned. But they were painfully young men who did not look ready for war. The soldier who fired a gun into the air to encourage them as they scrambled under barbed wire on the training ground needed help with reloading it. To be fair, these were mostly new recruits. Rebels in other parts of the mountains are said to be far better trained. Those who have seen them operate say they are fearless and totally committed to their cause. 'Jigsaw of war' Like elsewhere in Libya, they want the overthrow of Col Gaddafi, less corruption and better social services like education and health. But here in the Western Mountains there is also another motive - the reassertion of the ancient Berber culture that Col Gaddafi tried to suppress. For now, Nalut is a shadow of its former self. Over the two days I spent there I did not see a single woman or small child. They have almost all taken refuge in neighbouring Tunisia or in other Berber towns in the mountains. Before the anti-Gaddafi uprising began in earnest in Nalut, in April, the town had a population of about 30,000. Now it has less than 8,000 - almost all men of fighting age. I asked a senior rebel commander in the Western Mountains - which dip towards the sea near Tripoli - whether their strategy was to continue the march on the capital. The commander, who asked not to be named because he had family in Tripoli, replied: ""Maybe, but I can't fight on towards Tripoli when I also have the enemy at my back."" He was referring to the Sahara Desert town of Ghadames on Libya's south-western border with Algeria. There have long been suspicions that while Tunisia, following the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, backs the rebels, the Algerian army may prefer Col Gaddafi staying in power in Libya. It is another piece in Libya's complex jigsaw of war. Just as some of the Arab tribes and the ethnic Berbers may have motives that transcend the generalized ""revolution"", regional powers have their own agendas too. I asked the commander if he thought Algeria was supplying Col Gaddafi with weapons. ""He has plenty of his own,"" the senior rebel replied. ""I don't know if the Algerian government is involved,"" he said, enigmatically, ""but maybe it is.""","The Western Mountains are almost the ""forgotten front"" in the complex war raging across Libya - and it is a violent front."
"Prof Powis said ""every one of us"" had a part to play if the UK was to keep the death toll under 20,000. Business Secretary Alok Sharma also announced changes to insolvency rules and the NHS supply chain. The number of people to have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019. Mr Sharma said insolvency rules would be changed to allow firms greater flexibility as they faced the coronavirus crisis. He added that a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment, such as face masks to protect frontline NHS staff, were also being introduced. ""Red tape"" would be reduced to allow new producers of hand sanitiser to bring products to market ""in a matter of days"", he said. Prof Powis was also asked about the spread of the disease after a further 260 UK deaths in 24 hours. He replied: ""Clearly there has been a big increase in deaths today. ""If we can keep deaths below 20,000 we will have done very well in this epidemic,"" Prof Powis added, echoing comments from the government's chief scientific officer earlier in the month. He continued: ""It is early at the moment and the scientists who are working with the government to model what we can expect are of course adjusting their predictions now as we start to see the actuality of the epidemic in the UK, rather than what we believed might have happened a few weeks ago."" Analysis By BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby Despite today's news of the largest rise in people dying in the UK with Covid-19, the message is that everything we are all doing now to reduce social contact is having an impact - we just can't see it in the figures yet. That's because it takes time for the effects of not going out and not going to work to be felt in hospitals, where the most seriously ill are being tested and some are, sadly, dying. The epidemic is expected to peak in the UK in the next two to three weeks. Until then, it is likely the number of people confirmed to have the coronavirus and the number of people dying after testing positive for the virus will continue to grow at a similar pace - doubling every two or three days. The hope is that everyone's efforts now to stay at home and reduce the spread of this deadly virus will slow that growth rate at the right time, and, in time, bring it down. Every one of us now has a part to play in making that happen. Explaining the new measures to help businesses, Mr Sharma said he hoped the changes would help firms ""emerge intact the other side of the Covid-19 pandemic"". ""These measures will give those firms extra time and space to weather the storm and be ready when the crisis ends, while ensuring creditors get the best return possible in the circumstances,"" he said. The new rules will allow companies undergoing restructuring to continue to get access to supplies and raw materials. And, he said, there would be a temporary suspension of ""wrongful trading"" rules for company directors to remove the threat of personal liability during the pandemic, which will apply retrospectively from 1 March. We've seen the government announcing measures to give businesses access to cash in order to keep going over the past few weeks. Now it has turned to those that are facing insolvency. It has announced a temporary suspension of ""wrongful trading laws"", which stop company directors from being prosecuted for keeping a business going when it's insolvent or hasn't got a reasonable prospect of survival. The idea is to remove the fear bosses might have of trading through such turbulent and uncertain times and to give them breathing space. The chance to ""bounce back"", as the business secretary put it. However, much of the detail still needs fleshing out - such as how the government intends to keep suppliers working with companies that are in financial trouble. While business groups have welcomed the move, the trade association for the UK's insolvency industry, R3, believes this change could be open to abuse. All agree that this will stop a sudden spike in the number of companies going under - but in the long run it won't stop the collapse of businesses that fundamentally aren't viable. Asked how the prime minister - who is self-isolating with mild symptoms having tested positive for the virus - was getting on, Mr Sharma said he continued to lead the government's effort in combating Covid-19 ""This morning he held a video conference call and he will continue to lead right from the front on this."" He added that this showed why they were asking people to follow the government advice in terms of staying at home. Earlier, it was announced frontline hospital staff in England were starting to be tested to see whether they have coronavirus. Workers with symptoms and those who live with people who have symptoms will be checked - starting with hundreds of critical care doctors and nurses. Tests for A&E staff, paramedics and GPs are expected to follow, then social care staff. In Wales and Scotland, health workers are already being tested. Northern Ireland's testing begins on Monday. The British Medical Association said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was ""long overdue"", following concerns that healthy members of staff may have been self-isolating at home when they did not need to. The new tests being offered to frontline NHS staff are antigen tests, which indicate if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. Another type of test, called the antibody test, could indicate whether someone has recently had the virus. It is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in, for use once it is proven to work. In other developments:","""Now is not the time to be complacent,"" NHS England medical director Stephen Powis has warned at the government's latest coronavirus press conference."

"By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website The death of surfer Benjamin Linden, 24, who was apparently mauled by a large white shark, has sparked concern among government officials and prompted calls for the animals' protected status to be lifted. But are unprovoked attacks really rising in the region, and, if so, what might be behind such a trend? Dr Bob Hueter, director of the Mote Marine Laboratory's Center for Shark Research in Sarasota, Florida, cautions against jumping to conclusions. He told BBC News: ""When you have multiple attacks, it can be one of two things or a combination of both. The most obvious is that there are more sharks there in a place where people frequent for some reason."" Dr Hueter pointed to the example of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, where great white sharks are increasingly coming close to beaches popular with bathers because conservation efforts have caused populations of seals - which the sharks prey on - to rocket. ""The other factor - which is often the most difficult one to understand - is just this concept of statistical clustering,"" he explained. ""Because you get two events that seem to be close together in time and space, doesn't mean you've got a trend. ""That's what the media often doesn't get, as soon as you get a couple of these together they're talking on the evening news about an increase in this, or an increase in that. And that's just not necessarily the case."" The death on Saturday of Mr Linden has re-ignited a debate on lifting the protection afforded to great whites, to allow either fishing or a cull. After the last fatal attack in March, state premier Colin Barnett ruled out a culling programme, saying it was impossible to protect all people at all times. But talking to Australia's ABC television, fisheries minister Norman Moore said: ""I think we need to have another look now to see whether or not there's been a significant increase in great white numbers since they became protected. And if that's the case, should they still be on a protected list?"" He suggested researchers look at whether there had been an increase ""commensurate perhaps with an increase in the number of whales going up the coast, a number of seals that are also protected - which are food for great white sharks."" Rare occurrences Sharks are common in Australian waters, but fatal attacks remain rare, averaging about one a year over the last two decades. John G West, curator of the Australian Shark Attack File, pointed out that there were an average of 87 drownings per year on the country's beaches. ""People should be more concerned with swimming at a beach than being killed in a shark attack,"" Dr West, who is based at the Taronga Conservation Society in New South Wales, told BBC News. He added: ""For the last 100 years there have been as many as five occasions where there have been over 10 shark attack fatalities and eight occasions where five fatalities have occurred over a two year period. The events in Western Australia over the last two years are unusual in that they occurred in the one State. ""What is known is that white sharks in particular do swim along the Western Australia coast at various times of the year on their way between feeding and possibly mating grounds. ""They have been doing this for millions of years. The 'path' they travel brings them in close contact with the shoreline and in some case with people in the water."" Last year, Dr West published a scientific paper showing that the total number of shark attacks in Australia has risen from about 6.5 incidents between 1990 and 2000 to 15 incidents per year in the last decade. The rise, he explained, coincided with a number of factors: an increasing human population, more people visiting beaches and a rise in the popularity of water sports. People are also accessing previously isolated parts of the coast, getting into the water over a larger part of a shark's range. But Dr West pointed that there was no evidence that increases in shark numbers were influencing the rise in attacks in Australian waters. ""The increase in shark attacks over the past two decades is consistent with international statistics of shark attacks increasing annually because of the greater numbers of people in the water,"" he wrote in the journal Marine and Freshwater Research. Christopher Neff, who researches the political dimensions of shark attacks at the University of Sydney, called the situation in Western Australia ""tragic"", adding: ""Clearly there is some confluence of sharks and human behaviour that is taking place."" He told BBC News: ""In my estimation, we need to recognise that there is an increasing number of people in the water, for long periods of time, doing more things, and more often. Right now it is winter in Australia and it is still surfing season. ""While Western Australia can be warmer, the fact that surfing and swimming has become more of a year-round activity with the addition of better wetsuits and boards adds to risk level."" Dr West added: ""White sharks in particular are very inquisitive and are known to investigate anything that floats including cigarette packets, foam floats and buoys, surfboards and occasionally humans. The results of these investigations can result in severe and sometimes fatal consequences."" 'Prevention better' On the question of culling or fishing sharks, Dr Hueter told BBC News: ""Removing the sharks has never been a solution in any of these cases. The better approach is to manage people's behaviour."" He said it was more productive for authorities to implement measures such as restricting certain areas of coast or restricting the use of beaches at certain times. It may even be prudent to avoid wearing shiny jewellery, as it can reflect light in a way that resembles the sheen from shoals of fish. Dr Hueter said he recommended that people using Florida's beaches during the summer also steer clear of swimming in the water at night or during twilight hours because sharks were actively feeding during in that period. Sharks are also less reliant on their vision for catching prey at night, so they have fewer cues for distinguishing a person from more suitable prey. ""I say: 'Between the months of five through nine (Florida's summer months), go swimming in the ocean from nine to five.' What we find is that there are more incidents during the day, because there are so many more people in the water during the day. But if you go swimming at night, you stand out much more, and your individual risk rate goes right up."" Commenting on the situation in Western Australia, Christopher Neff said: ""The fact is that in Australia there are surfers going to isolated surfing spots everyday. ""I think the test is in recognising that the beach is the wild and we assume these risks whenever and wherever we go into the water."" Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk",The fatal shark attack off western Australia at the weekend was the fifth such incident in less than a year.

"The review could result in a price cap being imposed on the postal operator. The regulator said the inquiry will examine the ""efficient and financially sustainable provision"" of the UK's universal postal service. The universal service is the Royal Mail's commitment to deliver to all of the UK for the same price. Shares fell closed down 3.5%, or 18.5p, to 508.5p. The company is worth about £5bn and the shares are up 14% since its float in October 2013. Ofcom, which first announced the review last month, is concerned at the reduction in competition in parts of the letters and parcels markets. The letter delivery service arm of Whistl and parcel firm City Link both folded in recent months. The collapse of the letter service run by Whistl, formerly known as TNT, left Royal Mail with no national competitor in this market. Ofcom said it will also consider Royal Mail's position in the parcels market and ""assess the company's potential ability to set wholesale prices in a way that might harm competition"". The regulator said it could roll back some of the commercial flexibility given to Royal Mail in 2012, which included the ability to raise prices. In May Royal Mail reported pre-tax profits of £400m for the year to 29 March, down from £1.66bn for the previous 12 months. 'Consistent approach' Royal Mail said it would participate fully in Ofcom's review. ""We will be highlighting the need for a consistent approach to regulation. Ofcom's existing framework, put in place in 2012 was to have provided certainty for seven years,"" the company said. ""Royal Mail believes it has used the commercial freedoms granted by Ofcom in a responsible and appropriate manner to help secure the financial sustainability of the universal service in the face of significant ongoing change across the postal market."" Ofcom's review is expected to be completed next year.",Shares in Royal Mail fell on Friday after Ofcom confirmed the scope of a review into the company's operations.
"By BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why It's a familiar tale for many young women in the digital age. You sign up for internet dating hoping to find a suitable bachelor and, before you know it, you've received a picture of a penis. In this case, Samantha Mawdsley had done nothing more than post a review of a restaurant in Manchester. Before long, she had a notification from a man - calling himself James - whom she had never met. He had sent her a picture of his genitalia. In a blog post, she writes: ""I've read about these mystical happenings but since I've been in a loving, pre-Tinder, three-year relationship, I never thought I'd witness the horror first hand. My initial thought was to ignore it, as we females are taught from such a young age. But... Nah! I decided to mess with him and call him out on all his ridiculous behaviours and double standards."" Samantha's response was to give him a dose of his own medicine. She replied to him with a series of photos of penises. Then she uploaded screen grabs of the exchange to Facebook, embellishing the inappropriate area with colourful and mocking cartoon-like stickers. One of these showed an image of a penis covered by a clenched like fist with the words ""mine is bigger"". Unsurprisingly he didn't welcome the images and and one point messaged her, ""I just want to puke! Please stop!"". His final message requested that they keep the conversation between themselves, something which Samantha says encouraged her to call him out. ""I wanted guys to know that not every girl is going to be silent; you do run the risk of being exposed; that you can't do this."" The post has already been shared thousands of times on Facebook, despite only being uploaded on Sunday, and being removed intermittently since. The media analysis executive told BBC Trending that she is ""overwhelmed"" after being ""inundated with messages"". ""I feel like Beyoncé. I've had messages from all over the world, including Germany, Netherlands and even Aruba. People have been saying 'You're my inspiration' and 'You've won the internet'. I've also had guys also saying sorry on behalf of men. I'm so shocked. ""I've never received such a picture outside the context of internet dating, where that kind of thing goes with the territory. It's so prolific and this guy came out of nowhere."" Samantha is not the first to receive so-called ""dick pics"". This year alone has seen a number of women speak out about the issue. Model Emily Sears revealed she has been alerting girlfriends of the men who send her such images. Blogger and model Stina Sanders flagged up the problem by sharing a naked selfie sent to her by a troll. It also revived an old memory from her teenage years. ""I had an experience when I was 15 where a guy sat next to me in a library and started masturbating. Although I was quiet at the time, it made me want to point and scream."" What impact does Samantha hope her actions will have? ""I really think guys are going to think twice. I'd rather that they learnt the lesson it's unacceptable but I'd be happy if it just peters out and doesn't happen any more. It's sexual harassment and shouldn't be allowed."" Another man has already sent Samantha an inappropriate image since her post gained traction. ""I didn't even dignify that with an answer - I'm not playing that game."" As for the man on the receiving end of the unexpected publicity, the 30-year-old says she ""almost feels bad for him"". ""Of all the guys that sent them, he's just the unluckiest one. I know there's a person behind all this, that he's the poster boy for them, but for the greater good and for people everywhere, something just has to change. He can be a martyr for the cause.

"On a visit to a school in East London, he urged students to ignore what they have heard, telling them: ""You can still afford to go to university."" The deputy prime minister is launching a fight back against critics of his U-turn over scrapping tuition fees. He repeated his apology for breaking the pledge - but said more young people than ever were going to university. The Lib Dems have never recovered from the hit they took in the polls when Mr Clegg went back on his pre-election pledge to scrap fees - despite a widely-publicised apology that was even set to music by YouTube pranksters. With the European elections approaching, and a general election in 2015, the Lib Dem leader has decided to tackle the issue head-on again. 'Not a luxury' In a speech to students and pupils at the Bishop Challoner Catholic Collegiate School, in East London, he said: ""I want to make sure not a single one of you is being put off a degree because you think it's something you can't afford."" He said the Lib Dems had made a promise before the 2010 election to scrap tuition fees but had been forced to break it, because it would cost too much money and because compromises had to be made with their Conservative coalition partners. ""I've said I'm sorry for that, and I meant it. ""But what matters to me now is that you know you can still afford to go to university - and that you don't let the myths that have emerged crowd out the facts. ""This may not have been the policy my party wanted, but I made absolutely sure that it wouldn't turn a degree into a luxury for the very rich. ""I made sure that no student pays a penny up front - you don't pay anything back until you leave university, get a job and you're earning at least £21,000."" He stressed in his speech that repayments would depend on salary and ""if you don't earn enough to pay it back, eventually the money you owe is written off"". 'Graduation photo' Far from deterring poor youngsters from going to university, as some had predicted, their numbers have increased since fees went up, Mr Clegg said. This was down to the grants and other support that has been made available and ""by forcing universities to open up their doors and attract more students from lower income homes"". Some 21% of English 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds applied for university in 2014, compared with 18% in 2011 and 11% in 2004. In his speech, Mr Clegg added: ""To the mums and dads in the room: if you've always hoped to one day see that framed graduation photo of your son or daughter on your mantelpiece - you can still have it."" He took part in a a question and answer session with students at the East London school, as he sought to shake off the Lib Dems' image as the party that has betrayed younger voters. He said the new fees system meant there was now an ""incentive to universities to provide a better service to students,"" something he said had come as a ""shock"" to some institutions. Students were much more ""demanding"" than in his university days when it was ""easier"" and ""people were not under as much pressure to make decisions about their future,"" he added.","Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg fears ""myths"" about the cost of tuition are putting students off higher education."
"There is no formal confirmation but the Daily Telegraph says Huawei will build ""non-core"" components such as antennas. The US wants its allies in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence grouping - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to exclude the company. Huawei has denied that its work poses any risks of espionage or sabotage. But Australia has already said it is siding with Washington - which has spoken of ""serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere"". A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said it is reviewing the supply of equipment for the 5G network and will report in due course. Digital minister Margot James responded to the reports by tweeting: ""In spite of Cabinet leaks to the contrary, final decision yet to be made on managing threats to telecoms infrastructure."" According to the Daily Telegraph, Huawei would be allowed to help build the ""non-core"" infrastructure of the 5G network. This would mean Huawei would not supply equipment for what is known as the ""core"" parts - where tasks such as checking device IDs and deciding how to route voice calls and data take place. 'Different approaches' Huawei, a private company which already supplies equipment for the UK's existing mobile networks, has always denied claims it is controlled by the Chinese government. It said it was awaiting a formal announcement, but was ""pleased that the UK is continuing to take an evidence-based approach to its work"", adding it would continue to work cooperatively with the government and the industry. Ciaran Martin, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre - which oversees Huawei's current UK work - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a framework would be put in place to ensure the 5G network was ""sufficiently safe"". Asked about the potential of a conflict in the position of Five Eyes members, he added: ""In the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well."" What is 5G? 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says it is believed the decision to involve Huawei was taken by ministers at a meeting of the government's national security council on Tuesday, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. The home, defence and foreign secretaries were reported to have raised concerns during the discussions. In a tweet, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt said using Huawei equipment would raise ""serious questions"" about the ""government's interests and how they will secure networks"". Analysis BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The decision on Huawei is one of the most significant long-term national security decisions this government will make and was always going to be contentious. 5G will underpin our daily lives in ways that are hard to predict. So does allowing a Chinese company to build those networks put people at risk of being spied on or even switched off? That is the concern from Washington and other critics who wanted the company excluded. But deciding to ban Huawei entirely from the network would have risked slowing down the development of 5G and also upsetting China. The UK believes it has experience in managing the risks posed by Huawei and can continue to do so going forward. But one retired senior intelligence official recently told me his view on what to do about Huawei had changed. In the past, he said, he had believed the policy of managing the risk had been sufficient. But now he was less sure. The reason was not to do with any change in his view of what the company could do. Rather it was about the risks to relationships with close allies, namely those of the Five Eyes and US. Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat tweeted that allowing Huawei to build some of the UK's 5G infrastructure would ""cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to #FiveEyes cooperation"". Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said the proposals still raised concerns, as 5G involved an ""internet system that can genuinely connect everything, and therefore the distinction between non-core and core is much harder to make"". Joyce Hakmeh, a research fellow at think tank Chatham House and co-editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy, said the UK's current mobile network needs to be transformed to the ""the next level... quicker, more stable 5G"". But she added the government would be hoping its decision on Huawei did not upset either China or the US. Limiting - but not barring - Huawei technology from the 5G networks would be a ""diplomatic way of managing a difficult situation"" for the UK, said Ms Hakmeh.",The government has approved the supply of equipment by Chinese telecoms firm Huawei for the UK's new 5G data network despite warnings of a security risk.

'Blunder' But although its English name is well-known in the music industry, villagers argued the council's addition of the Welsh version was a ""blunder"". A notice by Llangattock Vibon Avel community council said: ""The village of Rockfield has been known as such over the past several centuries. ""The name Llanoronwy was introduced by Monmouthshire County Council's highways section in 2004 without consultation with the community council, which should have been statutory consultees. Community council clerk Roy Nicholas, himself a Welsh speaker, wrote asking for the Welsh versions of both place names to be removed. The local authority finally agreed last month. Mr Nicholas said he was delighted that the Welsh names had been ""peeled off"" the signs, adding it marked a ""return to common sense"". The name Rockfield has nothing to do with ""rock"" or ""field,"" but is derived from the French ""rocheville,"" he explained. But rather than being a literal Welsh translation, Llanoronwy refers to a church that may have been in Rockfield in the 10th Century. Gareth Smith, development officer at the Welsh Language Board (WLB), said it did not recommend using the name Llanoronwy for Rockfield. The WLB's guidelines say ""pedantic or antiquarian forms and literal or whimsical translations should be avoided unless there is sound evidence that they are in common use both locally and nationally"". A Monmouthshire council spokesman said it had consulted the language board for advice, which aid it was not necessary to have bilingual signs in every instance. ""As neither the name Llanoronwy or Croes Onnen are in common use or close derivatives of the English form, the Welsh Language Board did not support their use. Additionally, the reference book, A Gazetteer of Welsh Place Names, provides no Welsh names for Rockfield or Cross Ash. ""Although the original decision to use Welsh names for these villages was taken with the best intentions, it is clear that in this case it was the wrong thing to do. The removal of the Welsh names was ""very much a one-off,"" the spokesman added.",Welsh names for two places in Monmouthshire have finally been removed from council road signs after a long campaign.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The ride-sharing firm told the media some of its policies were ""unintentionally stacked against drivers"". In particular, drivers for the company will now have more ability to defend themselves against rider complaints and refunds. Uber also spoke about its continuing investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and ""toxic"" working culture. The news follows the recent departure of the company's president Jeff Jones, who said the ""beliefs and approach"" at Uber were ""inconsistent"" with his own views. Part of Mr Jones's job at the company had been to manage the relationship between the company and its drivers. Mr Jones held a Q+A session with drivers in February which provoked angry responses - one driver remarked: ""The ONLY thing you made clear to the majority of us is that you don't have ANY productive answers."" Real-time ID Rachel Holt, who manages Uber's operations in the US and Canada, conceded that the firm had underinvested in the driver experience and that the firm was now ""re-examining everything we do"". Last month, Uber's embattled chief executive Travis Kalanick was recorded arguing with a driver about falling fares. The incident prompted Mr Kalanick to admit he needed ""leadership help"". The company later announced it was hiring a chief operating officer. Central to Uber's plan to appease its drivers is giving more weight to their own defence in the face of customer complaints. Ms Holt cited the example of a driver in Toronto who had worked more than 8,000 trips - but after receiving just three complaints was barred from using the service (though he was later reinstated). Ms Holt said drivers who had amassed a long history of trips would be treated differently to a newer driver. ""We need to bring more humanity to the way we interact with drivers,"" Ms Holt said in a call with reporters. ""We're updating many customer support policies that were unintentionally stacked against drivers. ""We also need to give drivers a say in fare adjustments instead of relying on what a rider tells us."" However, the promises fell short of what many drivers have been calling for. ""If Uber truly cares about 'growing up' and listening to drivers, they should start by adding a tipping option,"" said Ryan Price from the Independent Drivers' Guild, an organisation that represents ride-sharing workers in New York. ""That's the number one request from drivers."" Rival services such as Lyft allow riders to use the app to tip drivers after a ride has completed - but Uber has so far rejected adding the option. Sexism update In February Uber was rocked by a former employee's devastating assessment of her time working at the company. She detailed several instances of sexual harassment and a culture that did not welcome women. In response, Uber announced it would launch an investigation led by Eric Holder, who served under President Barack Obama as attorney-general, the highest ranking law enforcement in the US. Liane Hornsey, Uber's new head of human resources, said more than 100 ""listening sessions"" had taken place across the company. ""The focus of the company has been on the business and not the employees,"" she told reporters. She said the atmosphere at the company had created a ""cult of the individual"".

"The Exeter-based regional airline's board confirmed it was ""in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale of the company"". Flybe said it was also reviewing other ""strategic options"", including cutting more flights in the face of challenges. A spokesman for the airline said there was no threat to tickets and flights that had already been purchased as a result of the review. Last month, the airline warned full-year losses would be £22m, blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs. Latest results, published on Wednesday, show that pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 September fell by 54% to £7.4m, on revenues down by 2.4% to £419.2m. The airline's shares have fallen by almost 75% since September. The Exeter-based airline is now valued at about £25m, far below the £215m it was valued at when it floated on the stock exchange in 2010. However, following the announcement of the review, shares leapt by 37%. Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, told the BBC Flybe had ""suffered from weaker consumer demand, which is typical for operators of regional airports and have also blamed Brexit uncertainty and a weaker pound unsurprisingly"". He says that ""the usual suspects"" are in the frame as potential buyers of the regional airline. ""I saw a hint of Stobart Group, the owner of Southend Airport, as a possible rescuer. BA, historically of course, had a share [in Flybe] and sold it. So we are looking for more details."" Stobart Group and BA-owner IAG refused to comment. In a series of tweets the British Airline Pilots' Association said Flybe's 2,300 ""talented, committed"" staff in the UK would be ""very worried to hear... that their company is up for sale"". Balpa said it believed Flybe was ""fundamentally a sound airline"" and that it would scrutinise any offers for the firm to ensure jobs were protected. It also said it expected to be consulted by Flybe and potential bidders over any future plans they had for the airline and its employees. Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe. It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from a costly IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs. Last month, Flybe's chief executive, Christine Ourmieres-Widener, said it was reviewing ""further capacity and cost-saving measures"". ""Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs,"" she said at the time. Analysis: By Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Flybe says its decision to put itself up for sale is due to the ""current challenges"" it faces - higher fuel prices, uncertain demand and a weaker pound. In truth, those problems are just the icing on the cake. The sale is in reality the culmination of a series of management missteps over the last decade as the company struggled to find a profitable niche. It was squeezed from below by smaller, more nimble rivals, and from above by the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair. Flybe has tried new aircraft - Embraer jets that eventually had to be got rid of at immense cost - and new routes - forays away from its regional base to Heathrow and London City airports - without ever finding the magic formula that would let it survive as an independent airline. All the while, cash has flowed out the door. Today's half-year results show a net outflow of more than £30m, leaving the company with just £52.4m in cash reserves. The accounts show that credit card acquirers, vital trade partners for airlines, are asking for more security. They also reveal departures of senior management: Vincent Hodder, head of strategy, and Peter Hauptvogel, the chief information officer, have recently left. All these management mistakes have been funded by Flybe's long-suffering shareholders. It floated in 2010 at 295p a share and raised £150m from investors in 2014. The shares currently trade at 11p.","Flybe has put itself up for sale, just weeks after issuing a profit warning."
"Citizens Advice Scotland said payment breaks allowed by councils during the pandemic had led to council tax arrears building up. The average debt owed is about £3,000, more than double the average annual council tax bill. The Scottish government said they had allocated £25m to councils to top up the £351m Council Tax Reduction Scheme. In 2019/20, 2,257 people sought help from the Citizens Advice network with a complex debt issue involving council tax, owing a cumulative £6.8m in arrears. A complex debt issue is where someone owes multiple debts. 'Action required' Citizens Advice Scotland's financial health spokesman Myles Fitt said: ""Scotland is potentially facing an explosion of council tax debt in 2021. ""The figures before the pandemic are bad enough, but the real fear is that Covid-19 is going to make matters much worse. ""Councils across Scotland showed a real empathetic approach to those who found themselves in council tax payment difficulties, and the payment breaks in the first six months of the pandemic were extremely welcome. ""However, this has led to arrears building up, arrears that will be difficult to meet for the many people who have during that period experienced an income drop due to unemployment or reduced working hours."" He said that for others, the problem was yet to come in 2021 when the furlough scheme and payment support measures stop at the end of April. ""Action is required to stop council tax debt - already the number one debt issue the Citizens Advice network sees - becoming an even bigger problem,"" Mr Fitt added. He called for help for those who ""have fallen into council tax debt solely because of an economic consequence of Covid-19"", possibly through the government writing off such debt, the establishment of a council tax hardship fund, or through long-term support from local authorities. The average debt owed is £3,020 - more than double the average council tax bill of £1,201. Delay enforcement action Mr Fitt urged people to check if they are entitled to council tax savings, reductions, discounts or exemptions - such as the Scottish government's council tax reduction scheme(CTR) - through the charity's online tool. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The pandemic and the resulting economic hardship has led to an increase in CTR caseload, with just under 500,000 households now receiving some level of reduction. ""On average, recipients save over £700 a year. We have allocated £25m to councils to help them meet the increased costs of the CTR scheme in addition to the £351m we already provide. ""During the pandemic we have asked local authorities to use their powers to backdate CTR applications by up to six months and not to take enforcement action until they are satisfied that the household concerned has not had its income impacted by the pandemic, or would likely be entitled to a reduction."" Council tax helps fund local authority services including social care, environmental services including waste collection, cremation and burials, transport and highways, courts, cultural services like libraries, fire services and planning.","A charity has warned of an ""explosion"" in council tax debt in 2021, fearing the pandemic will worsen arrears."

"Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez said four encampments in the eastern part of the capital, Caracas, had been cleared. He said members of the National Guard had found ""drugs, weapons, explosives and mortars"" in the tents. More than 40 people have died since anti-government protests began in early February and thousands more arrested. Mr Rodriguez said 243 protesters had been detained and that the authorities were currently determining who to charge. The minister alleged that protesters used the camps as bases to launch ""violent attacks"", after which they would ""hide in the camps saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest"". The arrests come three days after the pressure group Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the Venezuelan security forces of illegally detaining and abusing opposition protesters. Mass deployment The local mayor said that 700 military police officers were sent in to clear one camp alone. Student leader Juan Requesens said protesters would not be deterred by the mass detentions. ""They'll have to build bigger cells, because we students will continue to fight for our rights,"" he wrote on the social network Twitter. He also demanded that all of those detained be freed immediately. Discontent Anger about Venezuela's lack of security and high crime rates, as well as frustration with the country's poor economic situation have led to mass protests against the government over the past months. Students have been at the forefront of the protests, erecting barricades and organising demonstrations and sit-ins. The government has labelled the protesters ""fascist agitators"", accusing them of fomenting a coup against the left-wing government of President Nicolas Maduro ""with US backing"". A total of 41 people, including anti-government activists, members of the security forces and government supporters, have been killed in incidents linked to the protests. In a report published on Monday, HRW said that in some cases the security forces used torture, including threats of rape and execution. The protests first started in early February triggered by rising inflation, shortages of some basic goods and a high crime rate. The demonstrators blame President Maduro for ""mismanaging"" the economy of the oil-rich country and have said they will not cease protesting until he resigns.","Venezuelan security forces have broken up a number of protest camps and arrested almost 250 people, officials said."
"Hotmail, Office 365 and Skydrive were among the services affected. Microsoft was still analysing the cause of the problem on Friday morning, but said it appeared to be related to the internet's DNS address system. Such a major problem is likely to raise questions about the reliability of cloud computing versus local storage. Especially embarrassing is the temporary loss of Office 365, the company's alternative to Google's suite of online apps. Its service also went offline briefly in mid-August, less than two months after it launched. The latest disruption is believed to have lasted for around two-and-a-half hours, between 0300 GMT and 0530 GMT. In a blog, posted at 0649 GMT, Microsoft said: ""We have completed propagating our DNS configuration changes around the world, and have restored service for most customers."" The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating URL web addresses , such as bbc.co.uk into the internet's native system of IP addresses, e.g. 212.58.246.95. Cloud confidence Microsoft is not alone in suffering problems with its cloud-based applications. Google Docs was unavailable for a period on Wednesday. However, the fact that Microsoft's Office 365 is a paid-for service, with users charged £4 per month, may raise expectations of a more robust setup. Moving applications from installed software on individual computers, to web-based ""software as a service"" has been a major trend in computing in recent years. Such systems are seen as easier to manage, simpler to scale-up and down, and potentially offering more robust security. But a number of high profile failures have dented confidence in cloud computing. Among them have been several failures of Amazon's EC2 - the company's remote computing service, which allows businesses to hire additional processing power and storage on demand. The system failed in April 2011, impacting several large websites, including Foursquare and Reddit. Another period of down time in August affected many of the same websites. Spread the risk ""There will be an element of confidence shaken,"" said Ken Moody, data centre services manager at the Cloud Computing Centre. Avoiding major cloud problems in future would depend on IT companies' ability to spread the risk, according to Mr Moody. ""People should look at smaller data centres which are divided up where resilience could be guaranteed,"" he told BBC News. ""Our service level agreements are 99.99% because we don't put everything into one large data centre."" Mr Moody said that no-one, including its users, knows exactly how Microsoft's cloud computing systems are structured. Building future confidence in the platform may depend on sharing more information. ""There's a requirement for transparency and communication to prospective clients,"" he said.",Millions of Microsoft users were left unable to access some online services overnight because of a major service failure.
"In a stark report on public services, the Wales Audit Office (WAO) also says the Welsh NHS faces a tougher funding settlement than the rest of the UK. A WAO report projects a cash shortfall of up to £570m for the NHS by 2013-14. The Welsh government said it had been dealt a big budget cut by Westminster, but the Wales Office said the reduction was lower than the UK average. The report, called A Picture of Public Services in Wales, lays out the big financial challenges facing the sector. The NHS in Wales is predicted to be hardest hit, with a warning it may be forced into short-term cuts without having time to assess the impact on patient care at the end of the financial year. It suggests that based on current budget plans, spending on health per head of population in Wales is likely to be the lowest of any of the UK countries by 2014-15. It also warns that the NHS ""does not have a good track record of managing within the constraints of a budget set at the start of the year"" despite increased funding over the past 10 years. The report comes almost a year after a spending review by Chancellor George Osborne imposed budget cuts across the public sector as part of the UK government's attempt to cut the country's deficit. The Welsh government faces a real-terms capital and revenue cut of £1.9bn by 2014-15. Auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas said: ""These sustained real-terms cuts are unprecedented in modern times, and most of those leading and working in public services today will never have had to deal with financial challenges of this nature."" Knock-on effects His report uses a formula from the Treasury's Office of Budget Responsibility to estimate public sector job losses in the coming years. It predicts cumulative losses of 3,105 jobs this financial year, rising to a total of 20,985 by 2014-15. The figures indicate only a small proportion of potential job losses have actually occurred as a result of spending reductions, with the largest increases yet to come. The report also notes there will be knock-on effects on jobs in the private sector as a result. The auditor general added: ""Amongst the analysis of the difficulties they face, there are elements that provide some grounds for optimism. ""The need for transformation is now widely accepted and progress can be speeded up in order to put public services on a sustainable footing for the longer term."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said: ""This report confirms what we have been sensing for a long time. Clearly, our NHS is in a very difficult situation. ""While I congratulate the NHS on improving some patient experiences, we know that too many services that are offered are woefully inadequate."" Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar said: ""This report provides further damning, independent evidence that the Welsh NHS is under pressure like never before and ill-equipped to deal with the biggest cuts it has seen in its history."" 'Tough decisions' A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We welcome the auditor general for Wales report and its recognition that the Welsh government's budget will have been cut in real terms by £1.9bn by the UK government over the course of the next four years. ""The reality of what the auditor general himself describes as an 'unprecedented level of financial pressure' means we have had to take tough decisions on public spending. ""However, we have sought to prioritise and protect the services that the most vulnerable people in Wales depend on the most."" He said spending plans for next year increased funding for the NHS and schools, and that local health boards were producing plans to make sure their services were ""safe, sustainable and effective"". Plaid Cymru health spokeswoman Elin Jones said: ""In their draft budget, the Labour Welsh government has made clear statements that they intend to address the NHS budget shortfall by reconfiguration. ""This cannot be allowed to mean unacceptable centralisation of services away from our district general hospitals."" A Wales Office spokesperson said: ""Public spending per head is 12% higher in Wales than in England while the cut in the Welsh budget over the next three years is lower than the UK average. ""It is, of course, a matter for the Welsh government to decide on the funding of many public services in Wales based on what it sees as its own priorities and using the £15bn budget at its disposal. ""In particular, while the Welsh government is cutting the NHS budget in real terms the UK government is increasing investment in the health service in England by £12.5bn over the next four years."" ""The Comprehensive Spending Review last autumn set out the difficult decisions the UK government is taking to reduce the deficit it inherited from the last administration. Risks in the global economy underline the importance of sticking to that plan.""","Up to 21,000 public sector jobs could be lost in Wales over four years, a spending watchdog has warned."
"The dogs are advertised on the internet, and buyers are told to meet at Maidstone Services off the M20. One buyer spent £2,150 on a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel which became poorly three days after the purchase and later died. The RSPCA and Animal Protection Services have received multiple reports of such sales at the same services. Mae Goodwin, from Tenterden, had bought Barney, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, in May before her 21st birthday. Her boyfriend and sister had arranged to buy him for more than £2,000 and were told to meet the breeder at the service station at Junction 8 of the M20.

"Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he confirmed the UK's plan would include some customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit. But they would be ""absolutely minimal"" and ""won't involve new infrastructure"". The EU says it has ""not received any proposals from the UK"" yet that could replace the backstop. The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has said the exit will go ahead with or without a deal - despite MPs passing a law last month forcing him to ask for an extension from the EU if Parliament hasn't voted in favour of a specific deal or leaving without one. Details soon The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland has been a contentious part of the Brexit negotiations since day one. At present there are no checks on goods moving across it and the backstop was agreed between former PM Theresa May and the EU as an insurance policy to make sure that does not change - and that no infrastructure like cameras or security posts can be installed in the future. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks was agreed. However, the government says it is ""undemocratic"" and unacceptable. Speaking on day three of the Conservative conference, Mr Johnson said he believed the UK was offering enough to win the EU round and more detail would be made public soon. ""Yes, I absolutely do,"" he insisted. ""So, with great respect to all those who are currently anxious about it - and particularly in Ireland - we do think that our proposals are good and creative. ""But I accept also... there may be hard yards ahead."" He added: ""That is going to be where the argument is going to be - and that's where the negotiations will be tough."" The PM said there would ""have to be a system for customs checks away from the border"". ""If the EU is going to insist on customs checks... then we will have to accept that reality,"" he added. When it was put to him that it was not the EU who were insisting on customs checks, the PM replied: ""Well, let's see where we get to. And as you know, we made some very constructive and far-reaching proposals."" The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would need to be checks at ports, airports and perhaps at the border. But he said that would only be the case if the UK left without an agreement, telling the Dail: ""We've never been in the position of signing up to checks as part of a deal."" Mr Johnson told Laura Kuenssberg he always knew ""things would get choppy"" in the lead up to the Brexit deadline. But the PM believed ""fevers would cool"" and ""tempers would come down"" once that moment had passed. ""There's no way of getting Brexit done without... displeasing people who don't want Brexit to get done,"" he said. ""[There is] no way of delivering Brexit sort of 52% Brexit and 48% Remain - that's just logically impossible."" Mr Johnson added: ""I think once we get it done, and once we can begin building a new partnership with our new friends... we can start thinking about how we can do things differently."" At a reception hosted by the DUP at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the UK had made progress in the negotiations, adding: ""I hope very much in the next few days we are going to get there.""

Mr Johnson has repeatedly denied the incident, telling the BBC: ""It's simply not true."" He would not answer whether he thought Ms Edwardes - who has stood by her claims - lied or whether he remembered the lunch.

"The North Coast 500 involves travelling 500 miles (804km) round the coast of the Highlands. The trust has been driving the route in fully electric and also hybrid cars using charging points along the way. Rebecca Fretwell, of the trust, said such a trip would not have been possible a year ago. The trust has been visiting communities along the way, including Tongue, Wick, Lybster and Brora, to raise awareness about electric cars. Cars made by Tesla, BMW, Nissan and Renault are involved. There are 11 rapid charging points, which recharge batteries to 80% in about 30 minutes, on the NC 500, and others available in Inverness and Dingwall. Ms Fretwell told BBC Alba: ""We could not have undertaken this journey last year. There were just not enough charge points. ""Highland Council, the Energy Saving Trust and Transport Scotland have been investing in the rapid charge points network. ""There is now a rapid charge point within many communities within the Highlands."" The NC 500 is promoted as a tourist route to holidaymakers in the UK and abroad. It involves long stretches of single track road and also several challenging ascents and descents, including the Bealach-na-Ba at Applecross. The unclassified road rises to about 626m (2,053ft) over about four miles (8km). Last month, seven women cyclists set a time of 36 hours to complete the NC 500 in a non-stop team time trial. Their time set a new record for cycling the route. Scottish endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont previously completed the NC 500 solo in 37 hours 58 minutes.

"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@KarishmaBBCon Twitter And already, union chiefs are cheering his move. ""The TPP and agreements like it would actually speed up China's growing dominance and give Beijing access to trade benefits without asking for anything in return,"" writes Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, the US's largest labour federation in this morning's USA Today. Sounds like a fine argument, except for one big problem. China is not actually in the TPP, though it has quickly become the focus point of anger amongst many Americans about the loss of jobs in the US. And as I've written about before, the US could stand to lose far more in a trade war than other countries if Mr Trump sticks to this protectionist stance. Trumpisms on the TPP: How true are they? Before he came to office, and since, President Trump has had plenty to say about the TPP. But how much fact is there in those comments? Let's take a look at a few of them 1)""A great thing for the American worker, we just did"" So said President Trump in the Oval office as he signed the memorandum to pull the US out of the deal. It is true that America has lost some factory jobs because of free trade. And when China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, the draw of cheap and flexible labour did mean that workers in the US were laid off. But the reality is you can't turn back the clock - and those jobs aren't going to come back to the US no matter how much Mr Trump wills them to. That's because they're not going to people. They're going to robots. A study at Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic research last year found that trade accounted for just 13% of America's lost factory jobs. 88% of the jobs were taken by robots. Just take a look at the example provided by Apple's main supplier Foxconn in Taiwan. It's replaced 60,000 factory workers with robots. In my reporting trips across China, I have heard similar business plans for the future. Chinese manufacturers are automating their factories as a way to stay competitive in the future. After all, robots don't get sick, complain or argue about unfair wages and labour practices. What's not to like? So the theory that jobs will come flooding back to the US because it is no longer part of the TPP is inherently flawed. 2) ""The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country."" It is true that the TPP was a secretive-ish deal, negotiated behind ""closed-doors"" - but frankly, most trade deals are, so how valid was this comment? And it was a trade deal that arguably could have brought a lot of benefits to the US. For example, the trade-friendly Peterson Institute for International Economics writes that ""United States will be the largest beneficiary of the TPP in absolute terms"". It claimed that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by US$131bn, or 0.5% of GDP. According to these estimates then, Americans would have become richer, albeit marginally so, under the deal, and that the agreement would ""raise US wages...but not change US employment levels"". 3) ""Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence."" I'm not even sure what President Trump means with this statement, but perhaps it's got something to do with having the independence to choose who to trade with and how. American companies would have been amongst the most to benefit from the deal, as they would have access to some of the world's fastest growing markets says Deborah Elms at the Asian Trade Centre. At least 18,000 American products would have been covered under the TPP and would have been exported to other markets with few or zero tariffs. ""The TPP is a better agreement with the Americans included,"" says Ms Elms of the Asian Trade Centre. ""It was designed to fit a supply chain world and to more accurately meet the needs of companies than existing trade arrangements."" But, she adds, the game isn't over just because President Trump has pulled the plug on the deal. In this study, Ms Elms shows how the other TPP countries could go ahead without the US, and access the same benefits to the US even though it's not in the agreement. ""It will be American companies that lose out in Asia"" she says. ""And that will almost certainly filter down to American workers.""",Pulling the US out of the world's biggest trade deal - the Trans Pacific Partnership - was always part of President Donald Trump's plans.
"She was best known for her role as Mrs Bucket - Charlie's mother - in the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Her representative confirmed that the actress died in the early hours on Friday ""with family by her side"". In a statement they said: ""She was a loving wife, mother, grandmother and friend, and will be dearly missed."" The Willy Wonka movie is an adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Sowle memorably sang Cheer up, Charlie in the 1971 film. She was one of the last surviving adult cast members, after Gene Wilder - who played Willy Wonka - died in 2016 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. Remembering Gene Wilder, Sowle said in an interview: ""We'd be working on a scene and having a lunch break and he would be coming in to film another scene, and he would join us on a lunch break and we'd have lunch. ""He was so nice, he never acted like, 'Oh I'm a bigger star than the rest of you', he was always friendly and courteous and funny and told nice stories."" The actress starred in two other films - both in 1994 - when she appeared in Clear and Present Danger and Guarding Tess. She also voiced Agatha in the 2008 video game Fallout 3. Sowle frequently performed in the long-running murder mystery play Shear Madness, playing socialite Eleanor Schubert.

"The FBU said the new fire minister, Penny Mordaunt, had cancelled a meeting scheduled for Thursday. The government accused the union of an ""illogical"" approach to negotiations. Firefighters are set to hold a series of strikes for three hours a day for eight days from 9 August over a long-running row about pensions. Dialogue The strikes are due to take place until 16 August, between 12:00-14:00 and 22:59-23:59 BST, the union said. Andy Dark, the FBU's assistant general secretary, said he was ""absolutely astounded"" that the meeting had been ""scuppered"". He said: ""The minister has scuppered an opportunity to find a solution that could have meant there would be no need for strikes to take place."" But a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""Once again, the FBU has followed up positive discussions with the fire minister by calling further industrial action the very next day, rather than continue constructive dialogue. Fitness tests ""This is an illogical approach. Strike action serves only to make progress in settling this dispute harder and is unnecessary, counter-productive and at odds with the values of the fire service."" Firefighters have already held a series of walkouts over ministers' plans to raise their retirement age from 55 to 60 and increase their pension contributions. The FBU says it fears many members could fail the fitness tests required to remain on active duty in their late 50s, and therefore have to leave the service. It has also said proposals would mean that if firefighters opted for early retirement, the reduction in their pension would be ""unacceptably high"". However, the government says the deal on offer is fair.","The Fire Brigades Union has accused the government of ""walking away"" from talks ahead of more strike action."
"""We are bringing our country back,"" Mr Trump said during a visit to a mask-manufacturing factory in Arizona. New confirmed infections per day in the US currently top 20,000, and daily deaths exceed 1,000. US health officials warn the virus may spread as businesses begin to reopen. The US currently has 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 70,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which is tracking the pandemic. What did President Trump say? During a visit to the plant in Phoenix after weeks holed up at the White House, Mr Trump told journalists: ""Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we'll have a different group probably set up for that."" The president - who wore safety goggles but no face mask during his tour of the facility - was asked if it was ""mission accomplished"", and he said: ""No, not at all. The mission accomplished is when it's over."" Critics have accused the president of sacrificing Americans' public health in his eagerness to reopen the US economy ahead of his re-election battle in November. In Arizona on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that Democrats were hoping his coronavirus policy would fail ""so they can win the election"". Acknowledging a human cost to the plans, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I'm not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon."" However, it will be up to individual states to determine how they reopen. Some Democratic governors in badly hit states have been cautious, calling for more testing and other safeguards before easing lockdowns. Other states, many led by Republicans in the south and mid-west, have already begun lifting restrictions. The task force was set up on 29 January. Mr Pence became its chairman four weeks later and its members include more than 20 experts and leading administration officials. The White House said the task force's duty was to ""lead the administration's efforts to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus"" and provide the public with information. Mr Trump's once-daily task force briefings became increasingly scarce after he was widely condemned by the medical community for pondering at the podium last month whether injecting bleach into people might kill the virus. Dr Deborah Birx has been the task force's response co-ordinator. The president was asked on Tuesday whether she and another high-profile member, Dr Anthony Fauci, would still be involved in efforts to address the coronavirus. ""They will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field,"" the president said. What did the vice-president say? Mr Pence earlier on Tuesday told reporters in a briefing that the task force could soon be disbanded. He said the Trump administration was ""starting to look at the Memorial Day [late May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage, begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner"". He said it was ""a reflection of the tremendous progress we've made as a country"". Mr Pence has led the task force, which reports to the president and co-ordinates with medical institutes, political staff and state governors. The group also consulted medical experts to formulate national guidelines on social distancing. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later tweeted that the president ""will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening"". Lives and livelihoods The White House's shift in focus from the public health aspect of the coronavirus pandemic to its economic impact continues. For more than a month, the task force had been the public face of the administration's response to the crisis, even though President Trump sometimes veered far from the topic at hand during its press briefings. When the president wasn't talking, however, government public health officials led the conversation. Now, it appears, the officials setting the agenda will be ones more concerned with jobs, businesses and the fiscal health of the nation - even though the number of cases of the virus throughout the US continues to increase. There is growing frustration among the president's core supporters, however, with government shelter-in-place orders. Several states, encouraged by the president, have already begun to ease restrictions, even though they have not met White House guidelines for when to do so. Those recommendations were set by the current coronavirus task force, of course. And the ""different group"" in a ""different form"" that replaces it, as the president describes, may have other ideas. Does the US have the pandemic under control? Not yet. Besides New York, which is still the US epicentre despite an ongoing drop in new cases, the level of infection continues to climb across much of the country. Many states that have allowed some business to resume - including Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana - are seeing more new cases reported daily. While some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, others like Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago are seeing the caseload rise every day. According to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), more than 3,000 people may be killed by the virus each day by next month. The White House has dismissed the report as inaccurate, with Mr Trump saying it describes a scenario in which Americans make no effort to mitigate the spread of the infection. On Sunday, the president increased his forecast for the number of US pandemic deaths to 100,000, after saying two weeks earlier that it would be fewer than 60,000. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a public forecast model that has been frequently cited by the White House, now estimates that Covid-19 will account for 135,000 American deaths by 4 August. This more than doubles its 17 April forecast.","US President Donald Trump has confirmed the White House coronavirus task force will be winding down, with Vice-President Mike Pence suggesting it could be disbanded within weeks."
"The pair are said to have used it while on the way to help a suspected heart attack victim in Alston and a car was hampering their way on a narrow road. A local petition to reinstate them has attracted hundreds of signatures. The service said it was probing reports that blue lights were used without the necessary training on 5 October. More than 1,200 people have signed the petition which called upon the service to ""get them the training, but first drop the suspension and get our town's volunteers back out there first to respond while waiting for an ambulance travelling from miles away"". It said in a statement: ""While we very much appreciate the work undertaken by the volunteers in Alston, emergency response driving can put other road users, staff and patients at risk and so requires extensive training to ensure their safety. ""There are strict guidance and laws which cover blue light driving, which would be covered in the training so it is essential that blue light responders are aware of these or they could find themselves being prosecuted for road traffic offences, therefore we are taking these allegations very seriously. ""The volunteers in question have been stood down from duties whilst the investigation is ongoing."" Parish councillor Ray Miller said: ""Take the suspension off them and give them their jobs back. Get them blue-light trained, if need be.""",Two volunteer crew with the North West Ambulance service have been suspended after reportedly operating a blue light when they were not trained to do so.
"It was one of the bloodiest events of World War One - with 4,000 Welsh soldiers killed or injured on the first day, 31 July 1917. Among them was Welsh poet Hedd Wyn. The 38th (Welsh) Division played a central role in the battle, capturing key positions on the ridge at Pilckem. By the end of the battle - also known as the Third Battle of Ypres - half a million men had died from both sides, with Allied forces having advanced just five miles (8km) in three months. Events in and around what became known as the Ypres Salient started at dawn on Monday, as a memorial ceremony marking ""Zero hour"" was held at the Welsh memorial in Langemark. It was where men from the 38th Division - which was made up entirely of Welsh soldiers - went over the top, with orders to capture Pilckem Ridge, the high ground held by heavily reinforced German troops. During that assault, three Welsh Victoria Crosses were won. But by 11:00, Hedd Wyn had died at a dressing station at Hagebos, without knowing he had won the highest prize at that year's National Eisteddfod - the chair. A ceremony to remember him, and the Irish poet Francis Ledwidge, who was killed on the same day, was held at Artillery Wood Cemetery in Langemark on Monday morning. It was followed by a UK ceremony at the Tyne Cot Cemetery near Passchendaele itself, the largest Commonwealth war grave in the world. Prince Charles, Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May were among those at that ceremony to pay tribute to those who died. Prince Charles later joined the service to remember the Welsh fallen, giving a reading in English and Welsh, before laying a wreath. Wales football manager Chris Coleman also addressed the congregation. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, and the leaders of all the Welsh political parties, as well as descendants of those who were killed, also attended the service. The speeches and readings were delivered in front of the 9ft (2.7m) dragon sculpture, which honours the Welsh men who fought in the conflict. Mr Jones said: “It is a great privilege to be back in Langemark for this important occasion. “It has been three years since the memorial was unveiled and it offers us a fitting place to pay tribute and reflect on the sacrifices of all those who took part in the Third Battle of Ypres 100 years ago. “In this peaceful spot today, it is hard to imagine the horrors of war faced by our soldiers and the agonising wait of families back home who might not know the fate of loved ones for many months.” A new memorial to the fallen Welsh soldiers was blessed at the end of the service. Seven stones show the cap badges of five Welsh Regiments and two Welsh Divisions involved in the battle. The day ended with performances from the choir, Cor Rygbi Gogledd Cymru, and Welsh singer Rhys Meirion at the Last Post ceremony at the Menin Gate in Ypres. The gate records the names of another 54,395 missing and dead in the conflict who were never found. It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a service on Sunday evening, accompanied by the band of the Welsh Guards. “When you see these 54,000 names that are carved into the wall, you realise that they couldn’t find them. It’s amazing,” said Welsh tenor Meirion. “It is a stadium full when you think about it. It puts things in perspective and it is very difficult.”","The Prince of Wales and First Minister Carwyn Jones have joined up to 1,000 people in Flanders, Belgium, for the Welsh centenary memorial of the Battle of Passchendaele."
"It comes after last week's reshuffle by David Cameron saw George Eustice replace Richard Benyon as the UK fisheries minister. Mr Lochhead said it would be unfair to ask the new minister to head the talks. Allowable days at sea and mackerel quotas are among the main issues. Mr Lochhead said: ""I will be doing everything I can to secure a favourable outcome for Scotland's fishermen."" The EU fisheries council talks begin in Luxembourg on Thursday. Meanwhile, Scottish fishing industry leaders have welcomed ""productive"" talks with Mr Eustice and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael. The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) said the talks with the politicians covered a range of issues. 'Not feel pressurised' These included the mackerel dispute with Iceland and the Faroe Islands. SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: ""The meeting with Mr Eustice provided an early opportunity to brief the minister on the importance of the autumn negotiation period for the pelagic fleet. ""We stressed to Mr Eustice that newly-released mackerel scientific advice demonstrated that the stock was in robust health and that the UK should not feel pressurised into securing a deal which jeopardised the future of the UK pelagic fleet. "" He added: ""We also had a very useful briefing session with Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael, who expressed his full support for our industry."" Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, replaced Michael Moore as secretary of state for Scotland in the recent reshuffle.","Scottish Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead has asked the UK government to allow him to lead negotiations for Britain at crucial European quota talks, BBC Scotland has learned."

"Three men have been arrested after the devices were found in a van in Derry. One hundred homes had to be evacuated. But how did 'The Troubles', which caused thousands of deaths, first begin? Ninety years ago Ireland was split in two after people living there went to war against their British rulers. The south became a separate state, now called the Republic of Ireland. But the break-up led to decades of unrest and violence in Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK. There are two main sides: The period known as 'The Troubles' began in the late 1960s and lasted for nearly 30 years. British troops were deployed to Northern Ireland, at first to protect Catholics, but soon became involved in bursts of fierce fighting with paramilitary groups. Thousands of people on both sides were killed by bombs and bullets, while republican groups also launched attacks on England. What's the situation in Northern Ireland now? The Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 and was seen as a major step towards peace in Northern Ireland. It led to the Northern Ireland Assembly being set up. It makes many political decisions affecting people in Northern Ireland and has members from all sides of the community. But there are fears that violence is returning to a number of small areas where Protestants and Catholics live closely together. Ronan Kerr, a 25-year-old police officer, was killed by a car bomb in Omagh in April 2011. That was followed in June 2011 by several nights of rioting in East Belfast. Three people were shot in the city's worst street violence in a decade. Who are the main groups?",Police in Londonderry say four live mortar bombs discovered in the city on Sunday night were intended to kill.
"The Trussell Trust, a national Christian charity, currently operates 16 food banks across the counties. It said rising food and fuel costs, static income and unemployment had contributed to the increase. Working with local churches and communities, the trust said its aim was to open a food bank in every town. In Bodmin, Cornwall, a drop-in food bank hosted by the town's Christian Fellowship, which has been running once a week, has taken the decision to double the number of weekly sessions to keep up with demand. Jacqui White, a project manager for the trust's Wadebridge branch, said it was an ""ongoing"" problem for people living in an area with low incomes, high rents and seasonal work. ""It's a difficult time for everybody - even a lot of people who are in work are just not making ends meet,"" she told BBC News. ""About 90% of the time they can, but then if they get a big bill in for something - a boiler that's broken down or a car that's broken down - they just can't meet it."" Ms White said since it began operating almost four years ago, demand had doubled year-on-year. Food for the banks are donated by local people and given out by volunteers in exchange for a voucher, which clients can be given by local agencies such as doctors or schools. Nationally, the Trussell Trust said almost 350,000 people had received at least three days emergency food from its food banks during the last 12 months - about 100,000 more than anticipated and nearly triple the number helped in 2011-12.","Demand for food bank assistance in Devon and Cornwall has more than doubled, according to one of the biggest providers."
"The augmented reality app was made by students and staff at De Montfort University working with historians. Users of the freely available software stand on a Leicester street, point a tablet computer at a building and see what stood there in Roman times. Developers hope to make versions for other cities and periods of history. Nick Higgett, who led the project, said: ""The app acts like a window into the past and rather than stuffy text books it almost takes you back there to see what Roman Leicester was like."" Mr Higgett and his team worked with historians from the Jewry Wall Museum - site of the former Roman baths - and experts from the University of Leicester, including Richard Buckley, who led the Richard III dig.

They then point the tablet towards the site and it will show the ancient monument in a 3D reproduction. It includes a temple, now underneath a hotel, and a villa beneath the John Lewis car park, as well as the complete baths, which is now part of the Jewry Wall museum.",A virtual Roman Leicester has been created which allows users to wander the city's streets while viewing its ancient buildings.
"By Jim ReedNewsbeat reporter Police expect between 25,000 and 40,000 fans to make the 11-hour trip to Johannesburg or Cape Town before first round matches kick off on 11 June. This week sees the start of Operation Mulse. Thousands of travellers will be pulled aside by specialist officers armed with portable scanners linked to the police national computer. The extra checks are meant to stop any of the 3,143 fans with football banning orders, who haven't already handed over their passports, from making it to South Africa. Police also have the power to stop anyone they suspect of planning to cause trouble and, based on their criminal record, prevent them from leaving the country. ""The vast majority of supporters are going to South Africa to have a great time and enjoy themselves,"" said Bryan Drew, the director of the Football Policing Unit. ""You can never be 100% confident, but we have made as many preparations as possible to prevent organised violence and we hope that even if England win all their matches and progress, then the celebratory behaviour is kept within reasonable limits."" Banning orders Football banning orders are now one of the main weapons the courts use to try to stop people from causing trouble both at domestic matches and when England play abroad. Fan talks about living with a banning order They prevent people from setting foot in any domestic football stadium or leaving the country when England are playing away. Most of the 3,143 people on an active banning order had to surrender their passports by 2 June and will not be able to fly overseas without special permission until the end of the World Cup on 11 July. They also have to appear in person at a local police station on the day of each England game to prove they haven't skipped abroad on false documents. Officers from the Football Policing Unit say that the ""vast majority"" of passports were handed in by the deadline and they are now working with local police to track down the rest. The penalty for ignoring an order is a maximum of six months in prison, a £5,000 fine and an extension of the ban. ""It's a preventative measure to stop a repeat of that behaviour for between three and 10 years,"" said Bryan Drew at the Football Policing Unit. ""At recent England matches there have been no incidents and no arrests. In fact our supporters are often praised for their behaviour as opposed to a source of national disgrace as they were before."" Others though reckon banning orders might work in the domestic game but are less effective at stopping trouble abroad. ""Most of those people wouldn't have wanted to go to an England game in the first place,"" said Dr Clifford Stott from Liverpool University, who advises the government and police forces on crowd dynamics. ""The main factor is the nature of the police response. When it is proportional and legitimate then we see a decline in the overall level of violence."" Research from Liverpool University found that 97% of the 965 fans arrested at the Euro 2000 tournament in Holland and Belgium were not known hooligans. ""They were in place in Germany but there were still more than 800 arrests. Clearly there is an issue there because it hasn't stopped the problem."" Police say they are not complacent. Anyone caught causing trouble in South Africa will face a possible banning order when they return to the UK stopping them from setting foot in any domestic stadium for at least two years. Twelve officers from across the UK are also being sent to South Africa to support travelling supporters, spot potential trouble makers and advise local police on how to deal with England fans.","England fans might be more worried about Rio's replacement or who is going to play up front with Rooney. But at more than a dozen British airports, the authorities now have their eyes on the bigger picture - possible troublemakers flying out to South Africa."
"The 37-year-old mother from east London wept in the dock as she was convicted after a trial at the Old Bailey. Spells and curses intended to deter police and social workers from investigating were found at the Ugandan woman's home, the trial heard. Her 43-year-old partner was acquitted by the jury. Prosecutors said the mother ""coached"" her daughter ""to lie to the police so she wouldn't get caught"". The defendants, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denied FGM and an alternative charge of failing to protect a girl from risk of genital mutilation. Mrs Justice Whipple warned of a ""lengthy"" jail term as she remanded the woman into custody to be sentenced on 8 March. FGM - intentionally altering or injuring the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons - carries a sentence of up to 14 years in jail. During the trial, the woman claimed her daughter, then aged three, ""fell on metal and it's ripped her private parts"" after she had climbed to get a biscuit in August 2017. Medics alerted police to the girl's injuries after they treated her at Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone. She ""lost a significant amount of blood as a result of the injuries they had delivered and inflicted on her"", jurors were told. 'Sickening offence' While the parents were on bail, police searched the mother's home and said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"". Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said two cow tongues were ""bound in wire with nails and a small blunt knife"" embedded in them. Forty limes and other fruit were found with pieces of paper with names written on them stuffed inside, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation. ""These people were to 'shut up' and 'freeze their mouths',"" Ms Carberry said. ""There was a jar with a picture of a social worker in pepper found hidden behind the toilet in the bathroom,"" she added. It is only the fourth FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK. The previous cases led to acquittals. FGM campaigner Aneeta Prem, from Freedom Charity, said convictions were hard to secure because cuttings were ""hidden in secrecy"". ""People are scared to come forward, professionals are scared to come forward to report this,"" she told the BBC. ""The fact that we have a conviction today is a really historic moment."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said FGM was a ""medieval practice"". ""We will not tolerate FGM and not rest until perpetrators of this horrific crime are brought to justice,"" he added. Lynette Woodrow, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the ""sickening"" offence had been committed against a victim with ""no power to resist or fight back"". ""We can only imagine how much pain this vulnerable young girl suffered and how terrified she was,"" she said. ""Her mother then coached her to lie to the police so she wouldn't get caught, but this ultimately failed."" Ms Woodrow said FGM victims were often affected physically and emotionally for ""their entire life"". Female genital mutilation Source: World Health Organization The mother was born in Uganda but has lived in the UK for a number of years. FGM is banned in both countries, the CPS said. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the conviction sent ""a clear message to those who practise this barbaric act"". ""Every woman and girl should be safe and feel safe wherever they are in London, and we will continue our fight to end FGM with every power we have,"" he added.",A woman who mutilated her three-year-old daughter has become the first person in the UK to be found guilty of female genital mutilation (FGM).
"""I believe that the protests in Delhi over the gang rape of a student have no other political significance than a mere middle class fury,"" feminist and Dalit activist Rekha Raj says, standing with a microphone in the city of Kottayam in the southern state of Kerala. Men riding motorcycles slow down to hear her speak as a barrage of traffic noise competes against her voice. Ms Raj is talking on Dalit Camera about the significance of the protests and media outcry that followed the gang rape of a middle class 23-year-old medical student in Delhi in December 2012. In the traditional Hindu caste system, Dalits are considered the lowest and poorest. They make up 16% of India's population and are often forced into low-paying, undesirable occupations. And despite affirmative action programmes, they continue to face discrimination. Dalit Camera is an attempt at a historical documentation of the realities of life in India ""through the eyes of the untouchable"". It was founded by Bathran Ravichandran, a doctoral student of English at the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) in Hyderabad, the state capital of Andhra Pradesh. The two-year-old channel run by 23-member team equipped with four video cameras boasts some 1,400 subscribers. Some of its videos have been viewed more than 50,000 times. Mr Ravichandran comes from the ""manual scavenging"" caste, those who remove human excrement from toilets which do not have the modern flush system. 'Growing popularity' He was the first from his caste in his district in Tamil Nadu in southern India to receive higher education. He says he began recording video footage of atrocities against Dalits after 20 students attacked him on the university campus. ""The incident really changed my life,"" Mr Ravichandran said. He says Dalit movements and atrocities against them did not receive any exposure in the mainstream media, so through Dalit Camera he decided to ""give them a voice on the internet"". Recently, they released a series of videos where Dalit women or activists were seen discussing the reaction to the Delhi gang rape and its significance for lower-caste women. Some of these activists allege that upper-caste landowning men, who employ lower-caste women in farming, are often the perpetrators of high levels of sexual violence. These women do not have the facility to speak out and, therefore, the incidents are unrecorded in the media. Others believe the problem of safety for women in India transcends caste and class. Women's and children's rights activist Linkan Subudhi mobilised her friends to speak out on Dalit Camera against the state of life for women in India after the Delhi gang rape. 'Mainstream' ""Caste is not a reason for being raped. Any woman is now unsafe,"" she said. Dalit Camera provides information not only on the plight of the lower-caste women, but also takes up other controversial issues, says K Satyanarayan, professor of Dalit studies at EFLU. The channel has carried videos of activist-writer Arundhati Roy, Dalit music, and a southern Indian soft-porn actress talking about male dominance in the film industry. Past attempts to give a voice to the Dalit community did not see the same kind of success. In 1997, Punitha Pandiyan founded a newspaper called Dalit Masura in Tamil Nadu, but the paper struggles to stay in circulation, as often shop owners refuse to sell it because they do not want to associate with the Dalit struggle. But since its launch in 2011, the YouTube channel has begun to gain traction outside of Andhra Pradesh. It has already gained popularity in Kerala and West Bengal and is also harnessing a small but growing following in others states as well as internationally, says Prof Satyanarayan. ""Dalit Camera has become mainstream. It has had a reach I could not have imagined,"" he says. Vanya Mehta is an independent journalist based in Boston","Dalit Camera, a popular YouTube channel dedicated to India's Dalits (formerly untouchables), has become a rallying point for the community, reports Vanya Mehta."
"MiHomecare had not been paying employees to travel between clients, meaning their hourly rates of pay did not comply with the legal minimum. Richie Lewis, of the Unison union, said the firm was ""rectifying systemic errors"" and valuing its staff. MiHomecare said it had taken steps to ensure there were no future problems. Unison said, typically, care providers do not pay their employees to travel between clients and Mr Lewis urged other companies to review pay procedures. ""Home carers work long hours under increasingly difficult conditions and it is often the case that they end up out of pocket in order to provide the level of care that their clients need,"" he added. 'Amending rosters' MiHomecare, which operates Village Home Care, employs 6,000 home care workers in England and Wales who look after 10,000 elderly, disabled and infirm people. The company, said it had completed a comprehensive review of payments for all of its care workers ""to be absolutely certain that they are treated fairly and that we comply with wage legislation"". ""We have found some errors in calculating travel time pay and we have decided to make a one-off payment to all affected people,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Additionally we took steps in June 2015 to ensure that this should not be an issue in future by revising some pay rates and amending care rosters.""","About 100 home care workers in Swansea and Carmarthenshire are to be paid up to £2,500 each after a company breached minimum wage rules."
"Financier Bill Browder urged island politicians to approve a ""Magnitsky act"" when they meet in December. A number of countries have passed similar laws, named after Mr Browder's former lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Promotional body Jersey Finance said there was ""no evidence"" of assets being hidden in the island. Mr Browder, a US-born financier, said Jersey needed to adopt a version of the law and accompanying sanctions, which target those who commit human rights violations. If the law is approved by politicians, the island could become the eighth place in the world to adopt the measures, joining the US, Canada, Gibraltar and a number of Baltic countries. ""In a certain way Jersey adopting the Magnitsky law is more significant than many other places,"" he said. ""Interestingly Russian oligarchs and corrupt Russian officials use offshore jurisdictions to hold the majority of their wealth."" Mr Browder believes ""huge swathes"" of offshore money is unreported to Jersey authorities, going through layers of companies, trusts and other financial schemes designed to hide ownership. Jersey's regulator maintains a register of business owners but, unlike in the UK, this information is available only to law enforcement and not the public. Under Jersey's current laws, the island's government can implement UN and EU sanctions but adopting elements of UK law would further extend those powers. Jersey's offshore finance sector ""Ironically because Jersey is one of the more well-regulated and safer jurisdictions, it's a more attractive place than some of the dodgier ones for Russians to keep their money,"" Mr Browder said. ""For Jersey to exist as an offshore financial centre it cannot be seen in any way as a place that attracts dirty money,"" he added.","A high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed a possible law change to prevent ""dirty"" money flowing into Jersey."
"The 16-year-old girl died after being soaked in fuel and set on fire at her home in the Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Police said she was killed after telling her attacker she would inform her family about the rape. Two other similar attacks, one fatal, took place in Jharkhand this week. A 17-year-old girl remains in critical condition after being set on fire by a suspect who allegedly said he wanted to marry the victim, but had been rejected. The earlier case involved a 16-year-old who was burned alive after her parents complained to village elders about her rape. The accused had been ordered to do sit-ups and pay a fine as punishment, prompting them to beat the girl's parents and kill her. In the most recent attack, the victim was at home alone in Jujharpur village when she was attacked. Police said they had arrested a suspect, named as 28-year-old Ravi Chadhar. Widespread outrage India is facing renewed public outrage over the number of violent sexual assaults in the country. BBC India correspondent Soutik Biswas recently wrote that ""rape is increasingly used as an instrument to assert power and intimidate the powerless in India"". Recent public anger over sexual assaults was sparked by the rape and murder of an eight-year old girl in January. The girl, a member of a Muslim nomadic tribe, was found dead in Indian-administered Kashmir. Eight Hindu men were arrested, and there was an outcry when two ministers from the Hindu BJP party attended a rally in support of the accused. In April, Hindu right-wing groups staged protests over the arrests. Another BJP politician has also been accused of raping a 16-year-old girl - a charge he denies. Public outrage over sexual violence in India rose dramatically after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus. Four of the accused were given a death sentence, recently upheld on appeal, and the case led to new anti-rape laws.",A teenage girl in India has been raped and burned alive by her attacker - the third instance of such an attack in the same week.
"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent Nancie Atwell, a US teacher who won the Global Teacher Prize earlier this year, was visiting a school in London. She also said that teachers could get more attention from pupils from talking quietly than shouting. Ms Atwell won a million-dollar prize - but immediately gave the money to her school in Maine. On her visit to Capital City Academy in Willesden, north-west London, she said part of the prize had been spent on fixing the school boilers. Ms Atwell was demonstrating her award-winning teaching skills in an English lesson to a class of 12 and 13-year-olds, with Schools Minister Nick Gibb watching. Softly spoken and fastidiously polite to the pupils, sitting in a circle around her, she taught a lesson about two poems. She also told them that her own pupils called her by her first name. ""I've been teaching a long time and something I've learnt is, almost the softer you are, the more attentive they are."" If there were behaviour problems, she said: ""I would go to that student and say, 'What's the problem. You need to engage with this, stop talking.' I'm strict. I've also got what they call 'the look'... they fear it. ""The answer to almost every issue in the classroom is to talk to the kids about what's going on."" In terms of what made a great teacher, she said: ""It's not my personality, it's not my intuition, it's what I know about professional methods."" 'Life-changing' She emphasised the importance of applying the lessons of research about what worked in the classroom. Ms Atwell was awarded her prize at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai, with former US President Bill Clinton on stage. But she said that as a teacher ""committed to public service"", she would donate the prize to her school. Speaking in London about her donation, she said: ""I have everything I need. My car runs, my mortgage is paid, but my school and my students didn't have what they needed."" Ms Atwell said the prize, funded by the Varkey Foundation, was an important recognition of the ""life-changing"" potential of teaching. But she warned against education systems moving to what she thought was an over-prescriptive curriculum. Such an approach would limit children's range of reading, she warned, so that they would spend too long focusing on a small number of texts in order to pass tests. ""Parents are recognising that their children are being tested rather than taught,"" she said of US schools. Autonomy She criticised the move in the United States towards a ""common core"" curriculum, which she said ""inhibits teachers' creativity"". For teachers, she said an excessive focus on testing and a curriculum based on passing a test was ""de-professionalising"" teaching. ""It's done nothing but decimate morale,"" she said. ""It takes away teachers' autonomy, their ability to respond to who their students are and what they see is going on in their classroom."" But she emphasised how much could be achieved by teachers when they were able to engage with students and develop their creativity and writing skills. Mr Gibb, observing from the back of the class, said he supported Ms Atwell ""in her drive to highlight the importance of literacy and to help spread the love of reading around the world"". ""Every child, no matter what their background, should read widely and read well, giving them the best opportunity to get on in life."" And pupils in the class gave their own views on what made a great teacher - with a number of them saying they liked it when teachers were strict enough to let people learn. One, Keara, said she liked it when lessons were quiet and everyone could concentrate. ""There's a time for laughing and a time for getting on with the work,"" she said.","The ""world's best teacher"" says that a culture of excessive testing can damage standards and ""decimate morale"" among teachers."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Rapid response teams are now sent by insurance companies to major incidents, following criticism of their reaction to the UK's 2007 deluge. Householders hit by Storm Desmond and its aftermath have been told to stay safe, but to act to reduce risks of further damage or loss. This includes locking up unattended homes and keeping evidence of damage. Thousands of homes were evacuated or left without power in Cumbria after Storm Desmond hit northern England and Scotland. And some people and their homes and businesses are threatened by repeat flooding. Mark Shepherd, of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said insurers would be staffed over the Christmas holidays to deal with fresh claims. ""Everyone hopes the flood waters stay away over the Christmas break, particularly for residents of Cumbria who have already seen their properties inundated more than once in the past few weeks. ""People affected by flooding will be able to pick up the phone to their insurer on Christmas Day to get help, and work will start straight away on assessing damage and making emergency payments where needed. ""Sadly there was also flooding over the Christmas and New Year period in the winter of 2013 and we saw then that many loss adjusters were on the ground the same day to help people affected,"" he added. Advice from the British Insurance Brokers' Association to those affected includes: Meanwhile, many business insurance policies cover damage to premises and stock, but loss of trading owing to interruption is usually only covered if firms have paid an extra premium as an add-on to their policy. How does this compare to previous flooding? At present, the recent flooding is not the worst to have hit the UK, with about 6,570 homes and businesses having been flooded so far. The frustration and upset for many of those affected is that they have been hit before. For example, Cumbria was hit by devastating floods in 2005 and 2009. Some 25,000 flood and storm claims were made to insurers following the 2009 floods, with £174m paid out. All these incidents were still far smaller than the 2007 floods across swathes of the UK, which led to claims of £3.2bn. What compensation is available to those without power? There is provision in place for compensation to be paid to those who suffer lengthy power cuts as a result of storm damage. The amount of time that power is off and the severity of the storm are key to compensation levels. They are currently being assessed. Will this affect future insurance claims? A guide has been published for those wanting to obtain flood insurance who live in areas at high risk of flooding. Many of these householders are concerned about high premiums, high excess and a lack of access to insurance. A new scheme, known as Flood Re, has been agreed between the government and insurance industry and is planned to start in April. Under the scheme, residential homeowners in areas with the highest flood risks should be able to shop around for insurance, because the extra risk involved will be passed from the insurer to an industry body, called Flood Re, which is sponsored by the government. Insurers will choose which properties are deemed suitable for the scheme. Businesses, including landlords, are not covered by the programme. Brendan McCafferty, chief executive of Flood Re, said he expected insurers to be more likely to use the system now, with the latest flooding impact coming so close to the launch date. There is an issue for those whose insurance renewal is due before April. Mr McCafferty said these householders might decide that cancelling an existing policy a few months into the year - which might also incur a charge - and shopping around for a new deal, would be a cheaper option once the system was operating.","Insurers say a ""small army"" of claims managers have been deployed to flood-hit areas, but they have urged affected residents to follow advice to protect any claims."
"Councillors in Stirling agreed the maximum allowable rise of 4.84% at a meeting to discuss options for council tax and housing rent rates. The authority will set its full budget on 12 March. Clackmannanshire has set its budget with a rise to council tax of 3% - below the Scottish government's cap to the rate. Stirling Council said the council tax increase would allow it to raise an additional £916,000. The rise means the new rate for Band D properties in Stirling is £1,344.29 - a weekly increase of £1.19. Council leader Scott Farmer said: ""Council tax provides the backbone of funding for our services and, when set against a backdrop of continuing uncertainty over the national budget process and the continued reduction in funding for Scottish local authorities, choosing anything other than the maximum increase would mean the additional funding would have to come from our service budgets."" Housing rents in Stirling will rise by 3.2% from April. Clackmannanshire Council said it had set an ""innovative budget"" for the year ahead. Councillors approved a revenue budget of £128.3m and a capital budget programme of more than £18m. The new Band D rate in Clackmannanshire will be £1,304.63.",Council tax in Stirling and Clackmannanshire is set to rise from April this year.
"The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 ""age restricted ... high quality assisted living"" apartments for which it said there was ""a very high need"" for, along with 12 holiday lets. Its proposal document states the hotel has ""many deficiencies"" and ""few historic features of particular architectural or historic merit"" following development in the 1960s and 70s. Caroline Wilkins of the Friends of Glasshayes House campaign said it was the ""wrong type of development"" and the building should be restored. ""It's wrong on many, many levels - it's not needed or wanted. It is easy to take history and heritage for granted - it's up to us to preserve it. ""Any development has to be suitable for young families - finding affordable housing anywhere in the New Forest is very difficult."" She also said the intention to build up to the perimeter of the site would create a ""tunnel"" effect for air pollution on the high street. The development is due to be discussed by the NPA on 10 March.

"The Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, confirmed the move after the prison failed all the key tests in its latest inspection. Justice Secretary David Gauke is being urged to address the issues at the prison, which is privately run by G4S. The Ministry of Justice said it was waiting to hear the Inspectorate of Prisons findings. G4S did not comment. The prison, in the Winson Green area of the city, was graded ""poor"" on all four categories: safety, respect, activity and resettlement. Inspectors concluded their two-week unannounced scrutiny of the facility on Thursday. The urgent notification notice is the first issued for a prison run by a private company and will require Mr Gauke to formulate an action plan within 28 days to improve HMP Birmingham. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We await the inspectorate's findings and we will respond fully to their report and recommendations"". Only two other prisons - Nottingham and Exeter - have been issued with such notices since the system began last year. Separately, the BBC has learned that inspectors' cars were among nine torched outside the prison on Tuesday by two men reportedly ""armed with a firearm"". It is not thought the vehicles were deliberately targeted. One police line of inquiry is that the arson attack was connected to a major drugs operation in the prison. The Victorian jail was the scene of a riot in December 2016 which caused huge damage to four wings and resulted in 500 prisoners being moved out. An inspection report last year found a ""high volume of illicit drugs"" and described education and training as a ""major area of concern"".",The government has been issued with an urgent notification after serious failings were found at HMP Birmingham.
"The recent ""Spring 2018"" shows in New York, Paris, Milan and London saw a record number of models in their 50s and 60s on the catwalk - 27, according to the industry's forum, Fashion Spot. Does this mean that the fashion industry is finally breaking with beauty stereotypes and becoming more age-diverse? ""I've never worked as much over the past 50 years as I did in 2017,"" says 69-year-old model Maye Musk, mother of billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla founder Elon Musk. Canadian-born Musk started modelling in South Africa at the age of 15, but it's only in recent years that her career has picked up. Musk signed a contract with IMG Models, who also represent supermodels including Gisele Bündchen and Gigi Hadid. She also appeared on the covers of New York Magazine, Elle Canada and VOGUE Korea. And she starred as the oldest brand ambassador for American cosmetic company CoverGirl. A fashionable grandmother of 10, Musk believes that allowing her hair to naturally whiten has helped her career. But being a successful model comes with certain challenges. ""I have to plan all my meals and snacks every day, or the wheels come off and I gain weight,"" says Musk, a nutritionist with two masters degrees. ""It then takes two weeks of being really strict to lose it. I'm a UK size 8, so not skinny."" Debra Bourne, a director of All Walks Beyond the Catwalk - an initiative that aims to promote racial, age, size and body diversity in fashion - attributes much of the success of older women in modelling to social media. ""With the growth of social media through platforms like Instagram we have seen very successful examples of where elder models have created huge audiences themselves,"" says Bourne, a psychotherapist and a former fashion editor. This is certainly the case for Musk, who frequently posts photographs on Instagram where she has almost 90,000 followers. ""There is less competition when you're older, but also less jobs,"" says Musk. ""If you keep on working and posting your work, you can build up a following. ""Also, you can be booked directly from your photos and don't have to go to castings."" With sweat and tears ""I think many designers believe the current focus on silver-haired models is merely a trend that will be over next year so they can return to tall, thin, young colts,"" says Rebecca Valentine, founder of Grey Model Agency, which focuses on models aged 35+. Launched in 2015 to 'represent the new diverse older population', London-based Grey Models works with clients such as London Fashion Week and Hunger fashion magazine, and represents models including Vivienne Westwood's former muse Sara Stockbridge and 82-year-old Frances Dunscombe - one of the oldest models at the agency. To Valentine, who is also an experienced photography agent, the emphasis on older models ""is a response to market pressure where, for the first time, this ageing group are refusing to sit down and shut up."" ""They are the generation of rebels, punks, rockers, rappers, gay-coming-outers after all, they are used to being listened to and when they are not they shout louder and demand more,"" she explains. She believes the industry is catching up with the trend, but admits the process remains challenging. ""They [older models] can see that this is a tough mountain to climb with much adversity, prejudice and tradition to fight. ""It is wonderful to be surrounded by such strength and positivity at work,"" she adds. Beauty = youth? But not all industry experts agree on the rise of older women in fashion. Vincent Peter, co-founder of SILENT modelling agency in Paris, says: ""You can see older women on an anti-ageing cream advertisement, but they are unlikely to be booked for high-fashion jobs. ""Occasionally they are on a catwalk but rather as an exception. I don't see any trend here."" While the fashion industry may hold on to its rigorous age frames, Musk continues to secure jobs worldwide and hopes to work well into her 70s and beyond. ""It's been amazing to see how brands, magazines and designers are focusing on real stories from older women. ""Young models love to see me on a modelling job as it gives them hope for the future. My hashtag is #justgettingstarted.""","Youth is not everything - at least not to 69-year-old model Maye Musk. But, as Alina Isachenka reports, is her success more than just a trend?"
"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News The official review concluded the units at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital, Leeds General Infirmary and London's Royal Brompton should stop surgery. The review - set up on behalf of England's 151 primary care trusts - concluded expertise was spread too thinly across the health service. However, the units will remain open to focus on care before and after surgery. The ruling by the Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts means patients in England, Wales and some from Northern Ireland will have surgery at one of seven hospitals in the future. They will be Great Ormond Street in London, Evelina Children's Hospital, also London, Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Alder Hey in Liverpool, the Royal Children's Hospital in Bristol or Southampton General. Sir Neil McKay, chairman of the committee, said it was a ""landmark"" decision which would improve care. ""The needs of children, not the vested interests of hospitals, have been at the heart of this review."" Disappointment The hospitals affected immediately expressed disappointment at the decision, made after an eight-hour meeting of the committee, set up to represent the 151 primary care trusts across England. The Royal Brompton, which had challenged the consultation process in the courts, has argued stopping surgery would put its children's intensive care unit at risk. On hearing the news, Bob Bell, the trust's chief executive, said: ""It is very difficult to know what to say at times like these. ""But it is even more difficult to try and understand how this committee could have come to such a decision."" However, the changes were welcomed by doctors' groups. A joint statement by the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery said: ""All surgeons want to be able to deliver the best quality of care for every patient. ""While we understand that people do not want to see the unit that is close to them close, the extensive review process indicates that improvements are achievable by concentrating children's heart surgery in fewer, larger units in England."" Child heart surgery is one of the most complex undertaken in the NHS. About 3,600 operations are carried out each year on children born with a range of heart defects. Deaths Most survive to adulthood, but there is widespread agreement that, to provide a uniformly high quality and safe service, operations must be concentrated. Evidence shows this helps surgeons improve skills and share expertise. Surgery at one unit - Oxford's John Radcliffe - was stopped as recently as 2010 after a spate of deaths. But concerns about child heart surgery go back much further, with questions being raised ever since the Bristol scandal in the 1990s. The review does not apply to Scotland, where all children's heart surgery is carried out in Glasgow. But it does affect families elsewhere in the UK. Some children in Northern Ireland travel to England for treatment, although many are seen in Belfast and Dublin, while families in Wales have surgery in England.","Child heart surgery should be stopped at three of the 10 hospitals that perform the procedures, NHS bosses say."
"He made the announcement at a press conference in Washington DC, where he had earlier met US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. Ms Gillard ousted Mr Rudd as PM in June 2010. There has been speculation he plans to challenge her for the top job. Ms Gillard said Mr Rudd did not inform her he intended to resign. Amid the leadership wrangling she had faced calls from backbenchers to sack Mr Rudd - who said her failure to defend him from these attacks had helped him come to a decision. ""The simple truth is that I cannot continue to serve as foreign minister if I don't have Prime Minister Gillard's support,"" he said late on Tuesday night at the press conference in the US, which was broadcast live in Australia. ""I therefore believe the only honourable course of action is for me to resign."" He did not say if he would be challenging Ms Gillard for the leadership, but confirmed that he would leave the US the next day, arriving home in Brisbane on Friday morning. He said he would not be involved in a ""stealth attack on a sitting prime minister"". ""We all know that what happened then was wrong and it must never happen again,"" he said, referring to how he was ousted. Mr Rudd said he would consult his family and community before making an announcement about his future. He would do so before parliament returned next week, he said. Ms Gillard said Mr Rudd has not been in touch before his press conference. ""I am disappointed that the concerns Mr Rudd has publicly expressed this evening were never personally raised with me, nor did he contact me to discuss his resignation prior to his decision,"" she said in a statement. She said that she would call a press conference on Thursday to ""make a further statement"". Poll slide In recent days speculation had been mounting that Mr Rudd's supporters were planning a leadership challenge. The ruling Labor Party government is struggling to retain voter support and Ms Gillard has been slipping in popularity polls. She leads a minority government which relies on independents for its wafer-thin majority. She was grilled by Australian media last week over allegations that her staff worked on a ""victory speech"" two weeks before she ousted Mr Rudd. She refused to say for certain if she knew the speech was being prepared in advance, but stressed that she did not commission it. After the interview, polls published in The Australian newspaper showed that she had lost ground to opposition leader Tony Abbott. While support for him rose three points to 40%, hers dropped to 37%. At the press conference, Mr Rudd appeared to cast doubt on Ms Gillard's ability to defeat opposition leader Tony Abbott in the next election, due in 2013, asking colleagues who was best placed to lead the party to victory. ""Mr Abbott, I believe, does not have the temperament or the experience to ever be elected to hold the high office of prime minister of Australia,'' he said. ""But at present, and for a long time now, he has been on track just to do that."" Mr Abbott, for his part, said the ''instability'' was ''damaging Australia'' and the government showing itself ''unworthy to continue in office''.",Australia's Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd has resigned amid widespread reports of a leadership tussle between him and Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
"""So many lives have been changed forever,"" he said. ""So many families have lost everything."" The worst hit areas of Florida's northwest coast saw houses ripped from their foundations, trees felled, and power lines strewn across streets. Hurricane Michael struck on Wednesday with winds of 155mph (250km/h). It weakened to a storm as it moved inland towards the north-east, but at least six people have died, most of them in Florida. More than 370,000 people in Florida were ordered to evacuate but officials believe many ignored the warning. Governor Scott said the US Coast Guard carried out 10 missions overnight, saving at least 27 people. Which areas are worst affected? Michael ploughed into Florida's Panhandle coast near the town of Mexico Beach at 14:00 (18:00 GMT) on Wednesday, one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US mainland. Ranked four on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and with a storm surge of 9ft (2.7m), it lifted homes from their foundations and heavily damaged others in districts closest to the sea in Mexico Beach, CNN helicopter footage showed. Twenty survivors were found in the town overnight, AP reports, but 285 had refused to obey warnings to evacuate. Head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, called Mexico Beach ""ground zero"" due to the damage. Trees were downed in Panama City, northwest of Mexico Beach, buildings flattened, boats and electrical cables scattered. Apalachicola, with 2,300 residents, was also badly affected, the mayor reporting that downed cables were making it difficult to get through the town. Debris and floodwater are also making some of the worst-hit areas difficult to reach. Governor Scott urged residents not to return until the authorities ""make sure things are safe"", given the danger from power lines and other debris. Silence and sun By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Mexico Beach, Florida One of the first things you notice as you walk into Mexico Beach is the stillness. No wind, almost no-one on the street, just the beating hot Sun and the debris: debris everywhere, tossed and scattered - the calling card of a monstrous storm. And then you hear faint bleeping sounds coming from all directions - a dissonant symphony of high-pitched notes that turn out to be myriad small alarms, still transmitting their warnings from the batteries which power them. On the left, as we walk, there's a mattress slumped at the roadside, on the right a Dean Koontz novel lies in the dirt. Picking our way through a mass of rubble and detritus that was once a house, we spot an American flag on the ground; in amongst it all there is also a toy car and a cracked glass plate from a microwave. A little further on, and a woman, accompanied by a friend, is sifting through the remains of her home, loading what she can salvage into the boot of a car. This was her dream retirement place she tells me - the last four years spent doing it up. ""I'll never step back in there,"" she says through her tears. The sheer force of Hurricane Michael has been well analysed, but it's only when you see the everyday stuff of people's lives crushed, broken, smashed to pieces, that you realise they will be living with this long after we have gone. Who are the victims? Six deaths have been confirmed - four in Florida, one in Georgia and one in North Carolina. Florida officials say one man died when he was crushed in an incident involving a tree in Gadsden County. In Seminole County, Georgia, a metal car-shelter lifted by a gust of wind hit a mobile home, killing a girl of 11. Travis Brooks, director of Seminole County's emergency management agency, told ABC News there was ""complete and total devastation"". Michael earlier reportedly killed at least 13 people as it passed through Central America: six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Winds have knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses across Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas and Georgia. Around 6,000 are thought to have sought refuge in official shelters, mainly in Florida. What is the storm doing now? With reduced winds of 50mph, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Michael has moved north-east crossing Georgia and is now bringing heavy rain to North Carolina and Virginia. The NHC warned that communities in north-west Florida and North Carolina faced the threat of life-threatening flooding as rising water moved inland from the coast. The Carolinas are still recovering from the floods of Hurricane Florence. States of emergency have been declared in all or parts of Florida, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina. And further north, in Virginia 202,000 people are without power, officials said. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.

"Drivers are continuing a 48-hour strike, with another walkout planned for Friday. Almost all of its 2,200 daily services have been cancelled. Further strikes by Aslef have been called for 24, 25 and 27 January. Southern's owner Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) lost a court case and an appeal last year to halt the strikes. A statement said it was ""determined to protect its passengers and its business from unlawful industrial action"". It added: ""GTR is therefore prepared to continue its legal claim to the Supreme Court, as it believes that it has an arguable case that the industrial action is unlawful under EU law."" 'Door always open' Southern has insisted it will not back down in the dispute over who should open and close train doors. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, earlier said it had not had any conversations with Southern this week, but its ""door was always open"". ""I think it's the policy of both the DfT and the company that they won't talk to us in a week of action,"" he added. ""If they had come to us for talks, or been willing to talk to us, we would have spoken to them. ""We've never ever refused a meeting and will not be doing so in the near or anytime in the future."" What's the Southern rail strike about? Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, said the firm had met Mr Whelan a week ago and made a ""formal, comprehensive offer"" to settle the dispute, but was still awaiting a response. ""Active lines of communications are open with both Aslef and the RMT leadership and our door remains open to renewed talks,"" he said. ""This pointless dispute has to end, and end now."" 'Waste of money' In December, GTR lost its appeal against a High Court judge's refusal to grant an injunction blocking strikes by train drivers. Taking the case to the Supreme Court will be its final chance to launch a legal challenge. Aslef described last month's legal action as a waste of taxpayers', shareholders' and passengers' money. There has been no immediate comment from the union to the new legal move. The latest Aslef strike ends at midnight. Members are also operating an overtime ban. The RMT, whose members are mostly conductors, represents 12 drivers who are also taking part in the Aslef action. The long-running dispute centres on Southern's decision to turn guards into supervisors. In this role they would no longer be responsible for opening and closing carriage doors - this duty would become the responsibility of the driver. The RMT has been involved in industrial action since last April.",Southern rail bosses say they will take the Aslef union to the Supreme Court over its industrial action on the train network.
"It came as new figures revealed that the region has the highest rate of prescriptions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) drugs in Scotland. MSP John Lamont said the the statistics were ""alarming"". However NHS Borders said the medication was one of a range of measures used to treat the condition. It said the MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire displayed ""little understanding of the condition or its treatment and what the figures represent"". More than 180,000 daily doses of ADHD medication were prescribed in the Borders last year, almost twice that in 2009/10. 'Behavioural issues' According to the report by ISD Scotland, it works out as more than 20 daily doses of drugs per 1,000 people aged 0-19. Scotland-wide, an average of eight doses of medication were made per 1,000 people. Most received methylphenidate hydrochloride, which is also known as Ritalin. Mr Lamont said there was ""no reason"" why the health board should be prescribing the medication at twice the national rate. He added: ""Clearly more people are being diagnosed with ADHD and other behavioural problems as awareness about them increases, but the fact that prescriptions are rising in the Borders faster than anywhere else and doubling since 2009 is alarming. ""While there is no question that these pills have a role to play in the treatment of behavioural issues, I am concerned that young Borderers are being parked on medication."" Healthy relationships He called for the prescribing of ADHD medication to be reviewed and for a reduction in the number of young people on medication. Dr Ashley Cameron, of NHS Borders, said ADHD caused children to suffer low self esteem, perform poorly at school and have difficulty forming healthy relationships with their family and friends. The disadvantages it causes can lead to anti-social behaviour and a higher risk of substance abuse. The consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist said: ""The drug therapy is very effective and has a large evidence base to support its use. However, the children and young people referred to us receive a range of treatments and support for them and their families as well as any drug treatments."" She added: ""Any child on medication is kept under regular review and medication will only continue if positive results are shown. These reviews involve the child's parents and representatives from both education and health.""","Concerns have been raised that some young people in the Borders have been ""parked on medication""."
"Deputy Hunter Adam said the department was set to have spent £2.5m more than its budget for 2012. He said as a result, a surgical ward and theatre would close, as well as a mental health assessment ward. Deputy Adam said some non-emergency procedures and treatments would be deferred from December to January. He said that all patients due to undergo treatment or surgery in December would receive a letter from the department giving further details. As part of the announcement, Deputy Adam also said recruitment to vacant healthcare posts would be put on hold. All measures will come in to force in December 2012 and will last until the new financial year begins in January, when they will be reviewed. Deputy Adam said the department began examining its costs at the beginning of November 2012, when it anticipated an overspend of £1.5m. He said: ""Due to unavoidable pressures on services, it now looks like this overspend will be closer to £2.5m."" Deputy Adam said: ""Due to ongoing budget reductions... my department no longer has the flexibility it needs to respond to peaks and troughs in demands for services."" He added that the demand for some services had increased markedly during 2012. He said he would be requesting permission to present a report to the States of Guernsey requesting authorisation for the £2.5m overspend. Following the announcement Deputy Mike Hadley called for a vote of no confidence in the health board.",Guernsey's Health and Social Services Minister has announced the closure of two hospital wards and a halt on recruitment in a drive to make savings.
"Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary also says rules about accepting free gifts should be clearer. It says more robust systems are needed to avoid undermining public trust. But inspectors add that corruption is not endemic in the police service in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Inspector Roger Baker, who led the review, said: ""While we found no evidence of endemic corruption in police service relationships, we did find significant variations between forces and authorities in how they defined what is acceptable and what is not. ""This inconsistency made little sense to us and nor do we believe would it to the general public. ""There are no geographic boundaries when it comes to integrity and there should not be local differences in standards."" 'Wake up call' The review - which was ordered by the home secretary in July in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal - does not give forces a ""clean bill of health"". The HMIC report Without Fear or Favour looks at relations with the media, disclosure of information, hospitality, gratuities, procurement, contracts and business interests. Inspectors found a ""hugely inconsistent approach"" to accepting free gifts in different forces. Only 20 of the 43 forces in England and Wales gave staff clear written guidance to help them decide whether to accept or decline a gift, with 15 placing an acceptable value on gratuities of between £5 and £75. The inspectors found many examples of departments not recording gifts or officers recording it in their pocket books rather than in the formal registers. Mr Baker said there was ""an urgent need for a wake-up call for the police service and its leaders"". 'Seen to act fairly' The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said that while the review showed there was no ""systemic corruption"", individual officers were letting their colleagues and the public down. Staffordshire Chief Constable Mike Cunningham, who speaks for Acpo on professional standards, said it may be that officers should be told they should not accept gifts at all. He said: ""I think the public do have, quite understandably, some difficulty with some of the gifts that police officers have taken. And what the service now needs to do is look very carefully at the guidance it gives"". Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers in England and Wales, said the development of clear national standards was ""hugely important for the future integrity of the police service"". The report says forces should explore options for identifying and monitoring inappropriate relationships with, and leaks to, the media. It also calls for police forces and authorities to record ""all interactions between police employees and media representatives"". Inspectors point to 314 investigations over five years where there have been allegations of inappropriate relations or unauthorised disclosure of information between police and media. Of the 314, only 12 related to inappropriate relations and of these only one member of staff resigned. The President of the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales, Chief Superintendent Derek Barnett, said inconsistencies in the guidance given to officers should be addressed as a ""matter of urgency"". He said strong leadership was essential: ""The message from the public is that they expect the police service to be fair and impartial and therefore it is a matter of critical importance that the police should not only act fairly, they must also be seen to act fairly"". 'Problem with corruption' HMIC inspectors visited the 43 police forces in England and Wales, as well as the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the British Transport Police, and asked the public about their perceptions of levels of police integrity. The review found that the majority of people questioned do not think corruption is common, and trust the police to tell the truth. However around a third of the public think there is some ""problem with corruption"". Inspectors found that forces were ""outsourcing much of their back-office activity as well as procuring goods and services annually worth hundreds of millions of pounds"". They called for a ""cooling off"" period in contracts to prevent contractors from employing anyone, directly or indirectly, who had served with the force for the duration of the contract. Sir Denis O'Connor, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary said: ""The British model of policing is grounded in legitimacy. ""Any real or perceived conflict of interest is problematic for the police service as it undermines public trust and erodes police legitimacy. ""It is therefore fundamentally important that the service tackles the issues identified, that it is done swiftly and in a way that is long lasting."" The chairman of the Association of Police Authorities, Mark Burns-Williamson, agreed that the bodies that oversee police forces ""cannot afford to be complacent"". He said: ""Across a range of issues which could cause concern, the public will expect common sense to prevail and clear standards to be enforced with consistency. ""We will work hard to implement the inspectorate's recommendations as quickly as possible and share best practice so that the public's overwhelming confidence in the police will deepen, not diminish, in the future"".","Tighter controls are needed in the relationships of police forces with outside bodies such as suppliers and the media, according to a report into corruption."
"""It was a purely disgusting act by somebody who clearly has emotional problems,"" Mr Trump said to Breitbart, a right-wing news website. The employee was questioned by Secret Service agents and later released, according to local media. The bar confirmed that an ""unfortunate incident"" had occurred with Mr Trump. ""We did not witness the incident and we are just beginning to learn the details,"" the Aviary said in a statement. ""What is certain is this: no customer should ever be spit on."" Mr Trump told Breitbart that he declined to press charges against the employee, who has been placed on leave by the bar. A spokesman for the Chicago police confirmed on Twitter that local officers assisted the Secret Service on Tuesday evening with a ""law enforcement matter"" but did not elaborate further. The incident occurred at the Aviary, a James Beard Award-winning cocktail bar in Chicago's West Loop neighbourhood. According to local media, Mr Trump was at the bar at around 20:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Tuesday when he was spat on by an employee. The Aviary's co-owner, Nick Kokonas, made headlines in January this year when he invited the Clemson Tigers, national college football champions, to ""an actual celebration dinner"" at his restaurant, Alinea, after the president served the players fast food at the White House. President Trump, who hosted the team during the longest ever US government shutdown, paid personally for the meals. Mr Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organisation, was in town on a visit to Chicago's Trump Hotel. He told Brietbart he believed the incident was politically motivated. ""For a party that preaches tolerance, this once again demonstrates they have very little civility,"" the president's third child said, apparently suggesting the employee was a Democrat. ""It just emphasizes a sickness and desperation and the fact that we're winning."" The alleged spitting is part of a series of incidents in which members of the Trump team have been harassed or confronted over policy differences while dining out. Last June, activists heckled then Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Neilsen at a Mexican restaurant in Washington DC. Days later, former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant in Lexington, Virginia because she worked for the Trump administration.","Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, has said he was spat on by an employee at an upscale Chicago cocktail bar."
"By Tom AireyBBC News Countdown's debut show was filmed in Leeds and the broadcaster has now come full circle and selecting the city as its home for what it calls its national HQ. After solving its own conundrum between the finalist cities of Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham, the company can now focus on finding land for its new centre in West Yorkshire. About 25% of its 800 staff will be based in the city; actors, students, production companies and businesspeople have praised Channel 4 for finally making a move north. Actress and Fat Friends screenwriter Kay Mellor, who has a production company based in the city, was beaming with pride as the announcement was made. ""It's absolutely the right decision, every indie [independent production company] got behind the campaign and we've got the right result,"" she said. ""Leeds is the perfect fit in terms of location and talent and we'll all be there with open arms to welcome them to our wonderful city. It's a game changer, putting us firmly on the media map."" According to film and digital investment body Screen Yorkshire, TV and film industries in Yorkshire & the Humber generated an annual turnover of £424m across 590 creative businesses between 2009-2015. During this period, the growth of the sector in the region outstripped that of every other part of the UK, including the South East, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Sally Joynson, Screen Yorkshire's chief executive, said: ""We have worked tirelessly with the Leeds City Region team throughout the bid process and believe passionately that it will enable Channel 4 to engage with and better reflect audiences outside of London. ""Today's decision will be transformational to the screen industries in the Leeds City Region - and indeed across the North of England."" Analysis - James Vincent, BBC Look North political editor Channel 4 was set up to be different to the mainstream and by having their headquarters outside of London it's a claim they can now back up. Yorkshire won't just get jobs, it gets a huge boost to an already growing media and digital sector. Channel 4 gets access to one of the youngest and most diverse areas of the country. It might not be a move that Channel 4 initially wanted to make - the government told them they had to leave London - but it's a move that could transform an industry facing pressure to better reflect its audience. Channel 4's new Leeds home has been described as ""a broad-based centre"" which will include commissioning, production and digital content, with staff moving to the site in 2019. Paul Swinney, from Centre for Cities, said only time will tell what the real positives will be for the area. ""The brand element [of having Channel 4] is really great, but we shouldn't get carried away with the economic impact because those two things aren't necessarily the same,"" he said. ""From a jobs point of view you are only likely to see modest increase from the move."" The decision, which will also see Bristol and Glasgow gaining new creative hubs, is part of the biggest change to the structure of the channel in its 35-year history. James Mellor, creative director at Ripponden-based production company Rainbow Trout Films, said: ""I'm hopeful that they don't just do what they initially did with MediaCityUK in Salford, where they literally move a bunch of people from an office in London to an office in the north. ""That won't have the benefit - I would like to see cohesion with the local industry and resources."" Susan Hinchliffe, leader of Bradford Council, said the move means a great deal not only for Leeds but for all its surrounding cities. ""Yorkshire is a massive place, it's got diversity, it's got youth and actually for Channel 4 it will be really rich content for them to pull on for all their programming,"" she said. Henri Murison, from the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the student-heavy city of Leeds offered a ""young, dynamic vision"" for the company. ""It isn't an established broadcasting centre, that was what the other side of the Pennines was pitching for, so Leeds offers something a bit different,"" he said. Channel 4 announced its intention to move staff out of London after the government said the broadcaster would remain publicly owned, but faced being relocated. There was considerable opposition inside the company and it warned that forcing it to move outside London in its entirety ""would be highly damaging"". The compromise has been a move of some jobs but Channel 4 it will retain the lion's share of its staff in the capital. Declan Keevle, 20, who is studying film and television production at the University of Bradford, hopes the move can help him realise his ambition of becoming a director without moving south. He said: ""It's massively beneficial, most opportunities in the film and creative industries tend to be very London-centric, so to bring it up north is fantastic. ""There's a lot of universities up here with students doing creative degrees, it's a big talent pool to pick from.""","When Channel 4 launched in 1982, the first face beamed into living rooms around the country was that of Yorkshireman Richard Whiteley."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Three US states are also investigating the theft of names, email addresses and other personal data, which affected up to 145 million eBay customers. The online marketplace has begun the process of notifying its customers about the need to reset passwords. However some customers reported problems when attempting to do so. EBay told the BBC that it was not aware of any technical problems with the password reset function on the site. ""The site is busy, but our secure password reset tool is working,"" a spokesman said. The firm has been criticised for its slow reaction in informing customers about the theft of personal data. ""We are sending out millions of emails, and it will take some time. The process is certainly well under way,"" the firm told the BBC. It warned though that its official password reset email contained no links and that customers should be wary of messages that did. ""Any email with links is a phishing attempt,"" it said. Serious breach Meanwhile the fallout from the data breach was beginning to kick in. In the US, Connecticut, Florida and Illinois said they were conducting a joint investigation. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, the UK's information commissioner said that the eBay breach was ""very serious"" but that outdated and complex data protection laws meant the ICO could not begin an immediate investigation. He said the watchdog would have to first liaise with the Luxembourg data protection, where eBay has its European headquarters. ""There's millions of UK citizens affected by this, and we've been clear that we're monitoring it, but by taking the wrong action under the law now we risk invalidating any investigation,"" an ICO spokesman told the BBC when pressed on why the watchdog had not yet launched any action. Identity theft Questions are starting to be asked about how well eBay safeguarded its customers' data. Hugh Boyes from the Institution of Engineering and Technology questioned why eBay stored so much data in the first place. ""The Information Commissioner makes the point that organisations should keep the minimum information necessary so why do eBay need to hold and store dates of birth and addresses?"" ""As an occasional eBay user, I am concerned that not only have they lost my email, username and password, but according to their website the loss includes home address, phone number and date of birth. ""This is serious from an identity theft perspective. The only item they are missing is the mother's maiden name and they have sufficient information to impersonate an individual when dealing with many financial organisations."" Reports that large numbers of eBay customer details have begun appearing for sale in Pastebin - a site where hackers publicise their attacks - have been denied by eBay. Lysa Myers, a security research at ESET agreed that the data was unlikely to have originated from the auction site. ""The users that are shown in the sample would represent an odd subset of users for an international company like eBay. And the price asked (1.45 Bitcoin) would seem to be astonishingly low for the data of 145 million users,"" she said. ""Even if the sample is not in fact from the eBay breach, it could potentially be data from another company's leak.""",The UK's information commissioner is working with European data authorities with a view to taking action against eBay over its recent data breach.
"State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert urged all parties to ""avoid further clashes"". Iraqi soldiers moved into Kirkuk three weeks after the Kurdistan Region held a controversial independence referendum. They are aiming to retake areas under Kurdish control since Islamic State militants swept through the region. Residents of Kurdish-controlled areas, including Kirkuk, overwhelmingly backed secession from Iraq in a vote on 25 September. While Kirkuk is outside Iraqi Kurdistan, Kurdish voters in the city were allowed to take part. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had denounced the vote as unconstitutional. But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) insisted it was legitimate. Meanwhile, reports say a militia backed by the Baghdad government has taken control of the town of Sinjar in the north-western Nineveh province. The takeover happened without violence after Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers withdrew from the area, the reports added. Why is Kirkuk at the heart of this crisis? Kirkuk is an oil-rich province claimed by both the Kurds and the central government. It is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but its provincial capital has large Arab and Turkmen populations. Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when Islamic State (IS) militants swept across northern Iraq and the Iraq army collapsed. The Iraqi parliament asked Mr Abadi to deploy troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the referendum result was announced, but he said last week that he would accept them being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Sunday, his cabinet accused the KRG of deploying non-Peshmerga fighters in Kirkuk, including members of the PKK, which it said was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"". But KRG officials denied this. Territorial control before 16 October 2017 What's the US stance in the developing crisis? In a statement on Monday, Ms Nauert said Washington was ""very concerned by reports of violence around Kirkuk"". ""We support the peaceful exercise of joint administration by the central and regional governments, consistent with the Iraqi constitution, in all disputed areas."" Ms Nauert said the US was working with officials from all parties to ""encourage dialogue"", warning that ""there is still much work to be done to defeat Isis (Islamic State) in Iraq"". Earlier, President Donald Trump said US officials were ""not taking sides"". ""We don't like the fact that they're clashing,"" he added. Senator John McCain, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned the Iraqi government of ""severe consequences"" if US-supplied weaponry was misused in operations against Kurdish forces. ""The United States provided equipment and training to the government of Iraq to fight (Islamic State) and secure itself from external threats - not to attack elements of one of its own regional governments."" he said. What about Baghdad and Kurdish officials? Mr Abadi said in a statement on Monday that the operation in Kirkuk was necessary to ""protect the unity of the country, which was in danger of partition"" because of the referendum. ""We call upon all citizens to co-operate with our heroic armed forces, which are committed to our strict directives to protect civilians in the first place, and to impose security and order, and to protect state installations and institutions,"" he added. On Monday, the Iraqi military said its units had taken control of the K1 military base, the Baba Gurgur oil and gas field, and a state-owned oil company's offices. The government in Baghdad said Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers had withdrawn ""without fighting"". However, clashes were reported to the south, and the sound of gunfire was caught by a BBC cameraman as a team filmed near a checkpoint. By the afternoon, as thousands of people fled the city fearing impending clashes between the two sides, Iraqi military vehicles were rolling into the heart of Kirkuk. A picture shared on social media appeared to show Iraqi forces sitting in the governor's office. Forces pulled down the Kurdish flag which had been flying alongside the Iraqi national flag, according to Reuters. Mr Abadi had ordered the flag to fly over all disputed territories. The speed with which Iraqi forces reached the centre of the city has led the two main armed Kurdish parties to accuse each other of ""betrayal"". The Peshmerga General Command, which is led by President Massoud Barzani of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), accused officials from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of aiding ""the plot against the people of Kurdistan"". The PUK denied being part of ordering any withdrawal, saying dozens of their fighters had been killed and hurt, but noted ""not even one KDP Peshmerga has been martyred as of yet in the fighting in Kirkuk"". Meanwhile Turkey, which fears Kurdish independence in Iraq could lead to similar calls from its own Kurdish minority, praised Baghdad, saying it was ""ready for any form of co-operation with the Iraqi government in order to end the PKK presence in Iraqi territory"". The PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - is a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group which has been fighting for autonomy since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey as well as by the EU and US.","The US has called for ""calm"" after Iraqi government forces seized the northern city of Kirkuk and key installations from Kurdish control."
"Lord Price, a former Conservative trade minister, said fresh food could not be stockpiled like packets or tins. The government says it will act to secure food supplies if the UK leaves without a deal in March. It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resumes talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. Both sides are focused on getting a deal by October that can be ratified by the UK Parliament and the EU member states before Britain officially leaves on 29 March next year. But they are also stepping up preparations for the consequences of talks breaking down without a deal. Lord Price, who quit the government in September, said: ""What you will see is, rather than a pinch on supply - although that is highly likely - a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products."" He said the UK only produces about 25% of the fruit and vegetables it consumes and, while the winter season for imports from places like South America and New Zealand could be extended slightly to cover the UK's EU departure, supermarkets would have to find new supply routes. ""They may think about air freight, they may think about shipping,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But all these things are going to add cost and they are going to add to the cost of a tariff that will be applied because the EU has pretty penal tariffs on food, to protect European farmers."" France's European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau told Today a ""no deal"" Brexit would mean ""traffic jams in Calais and in each and every European port welcoming goods and people coming from the United Kingdom"". She added: ""We would all suffer. The worst would be for the United Kingdom."" Some UK ministers have dismissed talk of food shortages in the shops in the event of there being no deal. ""I am not aware of any plans for stockpiling food. It seems to me to be a fairly ridiculous scare story,"" Brexit Minister Lord Callanan told the House of Lords last week. ""There are many countries outside of the European Union that manage to feed their citizens perfectly satisfactorily without the benefit of EU processes."" Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs on Tuesday the government would take steps to ensure an ""adequate food supply"". In an interview with Channel 5's 5 News on Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not deny that stockpiling was happening, saying the government is being ""responsible and sensible"" while still trying to get a good deal with the EU. Mrs May has taken personal control of Brexit negotiations, which are being run by a unit in the Cabinet Office reporting directly to her. Mr Raab is holding face-to-face talks with Mr Barnier at the end of the latest round of Brexit negotiations, along with senior civil servant Olly Robbins.","The former boss of supermarket chain Waitrose has warned that a ""no deal"" Brexit would push up the cost of fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products."
"It does not have enough oil refineries and even if the four it has were running at full capacity, they would only supply a quarter of the country's needs, says John Ashbourne, an economist at the financial research firm Capital Economics. To meet demands, the national oil company imports around 50% of its fuel needs. The remainder is then supposed to be imported by private fuel distributors. But for months these companies have been reducing their imports leading to the current fuel shortages. The BBC's Nigeria correspondent Martin Patience looks at three reasons why: 1) Outstanding debts For years, the Nigerian government paid a fuel subsidy to make it cheaper at the pump. But it was hugely expensive when the price of oil was high. The current government, which came to power last May, said it inherited massive debts from the previous administration. Fuel distributors were initially left out of pocket. Finally, the government paid the bill in November. But by that time, companies had already started slowing fuel imports. 2) Currency crisis The slump in global oil prices is hammering the Nigerian economy. It has led to a shortage of the US dollars needed to pay for imports. With the country facing a currency crisis, the distributors are struggling to get their hands on dollars to pay for fuel imports. They say they are being forced to use the black market where they pay a far higher rate. 3) Fuel subsidy dispute In January, the government ended official fuel subsides saying the cost of oil had fallen so much that they were no longer required. But the fuel distributors disagree. In protest, some companies stopped selling fuel during this dispute. As the shortages increased, others hiked their prices above the official government rate - leading to accusations of profiteering. Some analysts predict that until the fuel subsidy is reintroduced or official retail rates are allowed to rise, distributors will continue to limit the supply. And for Nigerian motorists that could mean the long wait at the pumps will go on.","Despite being one of the world's biggest oil producers, Nigeria imports most of its fuel and is currently facing a severe shortage."
"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter But the plans the government is putting in place are not crystal clear. So what do we know about the ""plans"" and what details are still missing? Since September charities and some MPs have been calling on the government to offer homes in Britain to some of the thousands of child refugees who have already made it to mainland Europe. The government has continually said no. Ministers have been firm for months on the principle that it is far better to help those caught up in the migrant crisis in the region - in the camps and temporary accommodation in the Middle East and Africa than help those who are, they argue, in relative safety in European countries like Italy, France or Greece. The prime minister and his team have gone on the record on countless occasions making that case, and pointing out that the UK has been a far more effective and generous donor to the aid efforts in the region than any other European country. That's now changed. Downing Street diplomatically calls their new strategy a ""twin track"" - in other words, Number 10 has given way on a long held principle. Children who have made their way alone to Europe as migrants and who arrived in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March will now be eligible to come to the UK. Those who are selected, probably by aid workers on the ground in those countries, will be given five year residence permits for the UK, what was described to me as ""humanitarian visas"". What we also know is that the government was likely to lose the vote on this in the Commons next week. With the referendum campaign making everything tense, Number 10 was evidently just not willing to let that happen. But much about the plan is not yet clear. One source familiar with the conversations told me ""there have been five different positions in the last 36 hours"". Most crucially, what we do not yet know is how many children will be eligible, and how many will actually come. Discussions will now take place between the government and local councils over how many children on their own they could accommodate. There is of course already considerable strain on resources in local authorities right across the country What we also don't know is if there will be any extra cash available for councils who say they will take some in. But one source close to the negotiations told, ""if this is done properly it will mean thousands"". Finally, what is impossible to predict is what effect this will have on the ""pull factor"" - the concern ministers always voiced, that allowing more refugees to come to Britain once they were already in Europe would only encourage more to make the dangerous journey across the sea. But now the prime minister has ditched his principle and promised to open the door, campaigners, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and their own backbenchers will be pushing to make sure he does.","In the last couple of days David Cameron has been under more and more pressure to change his mind and allow more child refugees, on their own and vulnerable in continental Europe, to come to the UK. And despite his refusal to budge just seven days ago, budge he has."
"The picture was displayed alongside the message ""smoking clogs your arteries"". But the Albanian man, who lives in Metz, says he lost his leg as the result of a 1997 shooting in Albania. The European Commission, which is responsible for the distribution of such images, says the man is mistaken. The man's son discovered the picture - which bore recognisable burns and scars - when he bought a packet of rolling tobacco last year in Luxembourg, French media report. He brought the packet home to his family. ""He [my brother] was coming back from Luxembourg. Without saying a word, he put a big box of rolling tobacco on the table,"" the man's daughter told regional newspaper Le Républicain Lorrain. ""We were stunned. We did not believe it."" The family thought it was indeed a picture of the father's leg. ""It's our father's. His scars are characteristic,"" the daughter added. The man, who has not been named, says he had never agreed to the picture being used. He believes it was taken at a local hospital he visited in 2018 to find out whether he could be fitted with some kind of walking apparatus. He has been walking using crutches for more than 20 years following a shooting incident in Albania in 1997, in which he lost his leg. 'Betrayed' The family's lawyer, Antoine Fittante, is also adamant that the picture is of his client's leg. ""Each scar is specific, unique. This man also has burn marks on the other leg, it's very clear. An expert will have no trouble identifying the image. ""It's rather incredible that a person finds themselves without their agreement on cigarette packets throughout the European Union,"" Mr Fittante said. ""My client feels betrayed, wounded in his dignity, by seeing his disability [displayed] on cigarette packets in tobacconists; one must admit that's not very pleasant."" Mr Fittante has written to the hospital to find out how the photos ended up being used. Le Parisien newspaper, however, cast doubt on the claim by showing the same photograph in a collection used for an EU anti-tobacco campaign dated 2017 - before the man's visit to the Metz hospital. It also appears in an EU image database from 2014. The newspaper also said it had contacted the hospital, which could not confirm the man's story. ""We have the identity, the agreement and the rights for all the people photographed for this campaign,"" a European Commission spokeswomen said, quoted by Le Parisien. ""From the information we have, we can say without a doubt that this individual is not one of them.""","A 60-year-old man in eastern France says he was stunned to discover that a picture of his amputated leg had been used on cigarette packets, as a warning against smoking, without his consent."
"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The project was started by campaigners upset at what they call the president's ""ignorance"" on climate science. Trump Forest allows people either to plant locally or pay for trees in a number of poorer countries. Mr Trump says staying in the climate pact will damage the US economy, cost jobs and give a competitive advantage to countries such as India and China. The organisers say they need to plant an area the size of Kentucky to offset the Trump effect. Based in New Zealand, the project began in March this year and so far has gained pledges from around 450 people based all around the world. In the first month, 15,000 trees were pledged - that's now gone past 120,000. Some people have paid for trees to be planted in forest restoration projects in Madagascar, Haiti, Ethiopia, and Nepal. Others have simply bought and planted a tree themselves and sent a copy of the receipt to the project. The organisers, who are long-term climate campaigners, say they have tapped into a global sense of frustration with the president's climate change policies. Mr Trump has ordered a review of Obama-era climate regulations and he has also declared that the US will leave the Paris climate agreement. ""We've met some of the people on the front lines of climate change in Bangladesh, Mongolia and in other countries, and we found it extremely upsetting that Mr Trump's ignorance is so profound,"" said Adrien Taylor, a co-founder of Trump Forest. ""So we started to do something about it. Only a small percentage of the world voted him in, but we all have to deal with the consequences of his climate ignorance."" The organisers estimate that they will need to offset 650 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2025 to compensate for the president's policies, which translates into more than 100 billion new trees. Despite the massive scale of planting needed, the campaigners believe it can be done. ""We want to plant a global forest that will offset all of the emissions that the Trump administration puts in the atmosphere. It sounds a bit ridiculous but it is completely feasible,"" said Dr Daniel Price, another co-founder. While there has been much support, the organisers say they have also had ""a bit of hate mail"" from people who support the president's policies. However, they have also had some grumbling from people who say that calling the idea Trump Forest is simply stroking the president's ego. ""We kind of want him to love the forest; this is his forest after all. We would love it if he tweeted about it,"" said Mr Taylor. ""All we're trying to do is pick up the slack he has created and do the work for him,"" said Dr Price. ""So if he wants to take ownership of this forest just like Trump vodka and Trump Tower, we would welcome that; the phone line is open. So, Mr President, if you are reading this..."" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook.","A campaign to plant trees to compensate for the impact of President Trump's climate policies has 120,000 pledges."
"Developers scaled back the Lowther Hills scheme near Wanlockhead from 42 to 30 turbines. However, Dumfries and Galloway Council still opposed the proposals which were taken to a public inquiry. Ministers have now concluded their impact on the landscape would be ""unacceptable"" and refused the plans. A public inquiry was held into the project in late 2019 to look at whether it should proceed. Original developer Buccleuch sold its interest in the scheme to Forsa Energy prior to that. Forsa's renewable energy portfolio was, in turn, acquired by BayWa r.e. which was taking the project forward. The Scottish government has now issued its verdict on the plans which it said should not go ahead. Ministers agreed that the scheme could help meet renewable energy targets but that did not outweigh its impact on the area. They concluded it would have ""significant adverse landscape and visual impacts"" as well as adversely affecting the historic setting of Wanlockhead. The decision has been welcomed by MP David Mundell who represents Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. He said it was ""clearly the right decision"" and reflected the views held in the area. His son, Oliver Mundell, who is the MSP for Dumfriesshire said the scheme would have been a ""blot on the landscape"" and risked damaging ecology and wildlife in the area.","A wind farm project described as ""visually dominant and incongruous"" by a council has been rejected by the Scottish government."
"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst It was 0.05C hotter than September last year, which in turn set the previous record high for the month. Scientists say it’s a clear indication of temperatures being driven up by emissions from human society. Copernicus, which is the European Union's Earth observation programme, said warmth in the Siberian Arctic continues way above average. And it confirmed that Arctic sea ice is at its second lowest extent since satellite records began. This year is also projected to become the warmest on record for Europe, even if temperatures cool somewhat from now on. The elevated heat globally contributed to record wildfires in California and Australia. It also helped fuel the hottest day on record - a searing 54.4C (130F) in Death Valley. And it had a hand in the torrential downpours that inundated the south of France with more than half a metre of rain in a day. Météo-France, the French met office, said a downpour like this was expected once in 100 years – they had two in a month. Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, told BBC News: ""Some of these events are extraordinary – although we mustn't create a false expectation that temperatures will go up year on year. “Climate and weather are highly variable. But we predicted that these sort of events would happen, given our effect on the climate.” Weather records are always being broken naturally, but meteorologists say they’re disturbed by some of the new extremes. The UK is not immune. It enjoyed its sunniest Spring on record; August saw a record number of days overtopping 34C; and the town of Reading has just endured its wettest ever 48-hour period. Ed Hawkins, from Reading University, told us: “We have been saying this for decades – more and more greenhouse gases will lead to more and more warming.” He warned these events are being experienced with just one degree of warming globally above the long-term average, while under current rates of decarbonisation the world is heading for three degrees. “One degree of heating is dangerous for some people, as we've seen,” he said. “Two degrees is more dangerous still, and three degrees even more dangerous. We really don’t want to find out what that’ll be like.” The records were released as the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK would combat climate change by becoming the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. His speech was welcomed by environmentalists, but critics said he needed to back up his promises with policies and budgets.","September was the warmest on record globally, according to the weather service Copernicus."

"Ocky White was a popular Haverfordwest shopping mainstay for more than a century before closing five years ago. A report to Pembrokeshire council's cabinet said upgrading the Bridge Street building was ""critical"" to Haverfordwest's riverside regeneration. At a meeting on Monday, councillors agreed to buy the building described by one as a ""blight"" on the area. About £2.3m, including the £460,000 purchase price, will come from the Welsh Government's EU-funded Building for the Future fund. Councillor Paul Miller, cabinet member for economy, tourism, leisure and culture, told the meeting purchasing the building was part of a ""wider plan"" to redevelop the town. The Ocky White building renovation is one of Pembrokeshire's priority projects. The report said not regenerating the old department store would ""lead to a failure to deliver much needed and strategically important town centre regeneration in the county town"". It added that while the work would cost the taxpayer until the building is completed and fully let, there would be ""financial and marketing benefits that will help re-position Haverfordwest as a destination retail centre"". Supporting the plans, Councillor Tessa Hodgson said the former the store had become ""dilapidated"" and a ""blight"" on Bridge Street. However, Councillor Bob Kilmister said he was ""not convinced"" by the building plans, but to ""do nothing"" was not an option.",More than £3.5m would be needed to refurbish an old department store that was once at the heart of a Welsh town.

"Mark DevenportPolitical editor, Northern Ireland@markdevenporton Twitter Its introduction has so far been blocked by the veto power despite attracting the support of a narrow majority of MLAs. However, no-one should leap to the assumption that the Stormont parties will drop the controversial petition system in isolation, without revisiting all of the rest of the Good Friday Agreement's ""ugly scaffolding"". Back in 2014, a Stormont committee reviewed the petition of concern system and concluded that there was no consensus for reform. The committee considered whether the use of such petitions should be restricted to certain key areas. It also discussed whether petitions should be triggered by weighted majorities of 65%. Again it could not achieve consensus. Then last year the Alliance party tried to stipulate reforms to the petition of concern system as a precondition for taking the justice department again in a DUP and Sinn Féin led coalition. The former Alliance leader David Ford claimed Arlene Foster thumped the table in exasperation at this suggestion. The cross-community voting system, which is triggered by petitions of concern, was introduced as a guarantee against majority rule in Northern Ireland. Nationalists had long argued that the border was an effective gerrymander in order to guarantee a unionist majority. So they were never going to be prepared to participate in an assembly which might look like a recreation of the old pre-Troubles Stormont parliament. If the petitions of concern were dropped in isolation, then same-sex marriage might progress. But equally there would be nothing to stop, for example, a unionist majority changing, say, the definition of a victim. Some argue that the system should be changed so cross-community voting can only apply to constitutional or Troubles related matters. But some politicians will baulk at any attempt to tightly define what they might regard as a ""key area"". As the DUP leader put it, she thinks her critics want to keep the veto power for what they think is important but prevent her party deploying it in relation to its priorities. If the current cross-community system of ""parallel consent"" (a majority of both unionists and nationalists) is dropped that would logically mean there is no need to get MLAs to sign in as Unionists, Nationalists, or Others when they take their seats. One argument in favour of this is that it might enable Stormont politics to evolve, with a vote for smaller parties or others appearing less of a ""wasted vote"". 'Bizarre complexity' But there is still the problem of ""majority rule"" - which means most commentators have talked about requiring weighted majorities in order to ensure some level of cross-community backing for controversial policies. However, this in turn could lead to dilemmas. The TUV, for example, has suggested a weighted majority of 60%. This threshold would have blocked the November 2015 vote in favour of same-sex marriage just as assuredly as the old petition of concern. Moreover a coalition of unionists and others could, theoretically, have outvoted the nationalists who made up just 37% of the seats in the old assembly. The Stormont committee's 65% suggestion would - using the old assembly break down - require some nationalist buy-in, but not the assent of Sinn Féin. However, at this threshold the old DUP team would have still been able to block initiatives they opposed. The arch critic of the Stormont system, Bob McCartney, once told me that the working of the assembly was like a Heath Robinson contraption and that any attempt to alter it only added an extra layer of bizarre complexity. So it's not just about abolishing the petition of concern, but working out what might replace it. Certainly the post-election talks are unlikely to achieve any breakthrough on these basic building blocks of the Good Friday Agreement in a matter of weeks.",Arlene Foster's indication that she would like to see the Stormont petition of concern scrapped has focused attention on issues like same-sex marriage.
"Aberystwyth University had told students of its decision by email late on Sunday evening after 12 students tested positive for Covid-19. But the university has announced some in-person postgraduate study will start this week, with in-person undergraduate teaching to begin from Monday. Vice-chancellor Elizabeth Treasure said it had been sanctioned by authorities. The university had originally said its decision was based on ""uncertainty"" about the spread of the virus. But Prof Treasure said she was ""extremely pleased"" to get the ""unanimous support"" of Public Health Wales, Hywel Dda University Health Board and Ceredigion County Council to resume in-person teaching. ""This is excellent news for us and our students,"" she said. ""We will continue to ensure that the safety of our students, staff and the wider community is our priority, and we're very grateful for the way local, regional and national partners have worked swiftly with us to recognise that the best thing for our students to be doing right now is taking a full part in their learning activities."" Prof Treasure said the university would ""continue to impress on everyone"" the importance of observing Welsh Government restrictions and guidelines. ""We recognise this is a difficult and unprecedented time for students, and we have a range of support services available to help them,"" she added. ""We need restraint and restrictions on social activity in particular - every student must remain with their own student household and not mix with other households in a social setting.""

"It is investing about $900m (£682m) in new production capacity at a plant in Michigan, creating about 900 jobs. Head of global operations Joe Hinrichs said it had ""taken a fresh look"" at the growth in electric vehicles. Ford, the number two US carmaker, also said it would start production of autonomous vehicles in about two years. The company has been in talks with Germany's Volkswagen about an alliance to invest and built electric and autonomous vehicles. Mr Hinrichs said the talks had been positive, but there was nothing to announce. Last year, Ford set out a long-term plan to invest about $11bn in new vehicle technologies. Mr Hinrichs told reporters: ""When we were taking a look at our $11bn investment in electrification, it became obvious to us that we were going to need a second plant in the not-too-distant future to add capacity for our battery electric vehicles."" The latest investment will focus on Ford's Flat Rock plant in south-east Michigan, which employs about 3,400 people building the Mustang and Lincoln Continental cars. Ford was already planning an all-electric sport utility vehicle in 2020 that will be built at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. In January, the company said it wanted to have about 40 hybrid and all-electric cars in its model line-up by 2022 - about 16 of which will be fully electric. ""As we ramp up AV production, this plan allows us to adjust our investment spending to accommodate the pace of growth of this exciting new technology,"" Mr Hinrichs said. Carmakers are investing heavily in alternative vehicle (AV) technology because of pressure from regulators in the US, China and Europe to cut carbon emissions. The recent Geneva Motor Show, which Ford did not attend, was dominated by the unveiling of new electric cars and concepts.",Carmaker Ford is expanding production of all-electric vehicles after deciding that rapid growth in market meant it needed to accelerate its plans.
"MCS recommended 127 beaches across the South West for excellent bathing water quality out of 193 sites. Fifty-six Cornish beaches and 26 Devon beaches were listed as having the highest water quality. Bathing water tests were conducted last Summer. In 2009, 122 sites in the South West were recommended. Rain dependent Rachel Wyatt, from MCS, said: ""In the last three years there's been a shift in the water quality trends. ""From 2001 there was a steady improvement which peaked in 2006 when we recommended a record 505 beaches [in England]. ""Since then, water quality has declined due to high volumes of rain carrying storm pollution from the sewer system, farmland and towns into the sea. ""The regional pattern to this rainfall means that some regions fared worse in this year's guide whereas others like the Channel Isles did markedly better."" Throughout the UK, 421 (55%) of the UK's 769 bathing beaches have been recommended for excellent water quality this year.",The number of Devon and Cornwall beaches recommended by the Marine Conservation Society's (MCS) Good Beach Guide has risen by 4% in a year.

"Restrictions will be relaxed for the festive period but there is pressure for tougher rules from 28 December with more than 1,900 in hospital. Mark Drakeford said that while stricter rules were not a ""foregone conclusion"" the NHS will ""not be able to cope"" if admissions continue to rise. Outdoor attractions in Wales have been told they must close from Monday. The Welsh Government said the measure includes funfairs, and venues such as trampoline parks. It means attractions such as Swansea's Museum Park Christmas event, with a big wheel, rides and games stalls, will be shutting from Saturday, say its organisers. But other events, such as Christmas shopping markets across Wales will remain open - though carousel and fun rides in these locations will also have to shut. It follows a decision to close secondary schools and FE colleges from Friday; ban alcohol sales from pubs and restaurants and close hospitality venues at 18:00. Welsh Conservatives said responsibility for the current situation rests on ""the shoulders of the Welsh Labour-led Government"". Next week the Welsh Government will publish a ""Covid control plan"" laying out four alert levels of restrictions that could be imposed. At the highest level - level four - restrictions would be imposed that are equivalent to a lockdown. Mr Drakeford told a press conference it would be ""inevitable"" Wales would move to level four after Christmas if the measures taken recently and ""the efforts of each and every one of us do not succeed in turning the tide of the virus"". Under the four alert levels The first minister suggested that level four restrictions would be Wales-wide but, in future, different areas of Wales could move to different levels. He warned that any new lockdown would not be for a fixed period of time, as weth the firebreak in October and November, but would be reviewed ""on a regular cycle"" and would be extended if needed. Mr Drakeford said Wales was currently at level three. The plan, to be put to the Senedd on Tuesday for debate, would set out how it would be possible to have more than one alert level in Wales if ""some parts of Wales established themselves in a reliable... and sustainable way as having a different level of the virus"". But he said Wales was not in that position now with the situation being ""very serious"" across the whole of the country. ""In some parts of Wales, such as Neath Port Talbot, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf, the rates are now incredibly high,"" he added. Mr Drakeford also warned there could be as many as 2,500 people with coronavirus in hospitals by Christmas Day, if the increases in admissions continue. ""Our NHS will not be able to cope if we continue to see this level of coronavirus-related admissions in the coming weeks, on top of the normal winter pressures,"" he said. What would level four mean? Under level four, Wales would see restrictions similar to the spring lockdown, with people told to stay at home but with schools and colleges and places of worship remaining open. There would be no extended household bubbles, except for single adults who could form a support bubble with one other household. No-one would be allowed to meet people outside their household or travel without a reasonable excuse. Non-essential retail would be shut, but with click and collect allowed. Public parks would be open and wedding ceremonies could take place, but receptions and wakes would not be allowed. Uncertainty 'hard' In Bridgend, car dealer Nathan Griffiths wants to put 2020 behind him, and look forward to 2021. But the potential for a new lockdown after the Christmas break could dampen those hopes. ""As an employer, January is normally a really busy time for us,"" he said. ""We're even looking, if this announcement goes through, that we actually just furlough everybody and close for January."" It would hit the 100 staff they have across three sites. They had been hoping to expand the business in 2020 to a fourth site. Instead, it could now mean reducing the sites to two. ""I think the uncertainty is the hardest thing,"" he added. What is the political reaction? Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: ""The First Minister's announcement today set out the bleak landscape before the people of Wales in relation to Covid infection rates and the huge pressure our NHS is under. ""Much of the responsibility for the current situation sits on the shoulders of the Welsh Labour-led Government for the poor decisions they have taken up until today. ""As Welsh Conservatives, we stand ready to work with the government here to bear down on the virus and regain control of the situation"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""You've only got to look at the trajectory that we are on, certainly for Wales as a whole, to see that if things don't improve it's very, very likely we will need tighter restrictions."" He agreed with the idea of acting in a ""regionally sensitive way"" and said his own Ynys Mon constituency currently had low case numbers, but had seen larger outbreaks earlier in the year. ""The problem with a fully national system is you are perhaps trying to balance what's effective in areas of high prevalence with what's acceptable in areas where it's very low,"" he said.","A post-Christmas lockdown will come into force if Covid cases do not begin to fall, the first minister has warned."
"Castell Howell Foods, in Cross Hands, said it had contacted the five customers who received deliveries of a range of cottage pies. The company said it was told last Friday by frozen ready meals supplier Oak Farm that there was the possibility of horsemeat contamination. Oak Farm has launched an investigation. Supplies of the frozen cottage pie product have been suspended and a recall has been carried out. Nigel Williams, financial director at Castell Howell, said the company has collected the cottage pies from customers affected.

"By Gillian SharpeBBC Scotland Bringing up Baby, a new exhibition at Edinburgh's Museum of Childhood, is exploring some of them. It was the anniversary of the Scottish Baby Box scheme last year which prompted museum staff to come up with the idea. Partly it is a collection of seemingly ordinary looking objects which can actually say a lot about the way people have parented over the years. ""All the different advice they're given, the different opinions they hear,"" says Lyn Stevens, curator at the Museum of Childhood. ""That sort of excitement mixed with anxiety about the arrival of a baby and how are they going to approach parenting."" The display is arranged on the themes of sleeping, feeding, keeping a baby clean and dressing them; glass cases full of items from across the decades - books, clothes, dummies, nappies and more. One case looks at clothing through the years and starts in the very early 20th century when baby clothes were usually made of lightweight, white fabric and were quite neutral in terms of whether a boy or girl was wearing them. By the mid-century onwards they have a display of knitted items, alongside a distinctive blue, synthetic smock top. ""It's almost like a mini-Austen Powers outfit really,"" laughs Lyn Stevens. The museum has also added some up-to-date baby clothes. The boy clothes they have picked have logos which talk about heroes and soldiers, while the pink girl outfit is adorned with a net tutu and sparkly unicorn. ""It's a choice of parents and family and friends what they purchase,"" Ms Stevens adds. ""It doesn't have to be those but the fact that they're on the market is quite interesting."" Many of the items on display would be familiar to a parent of whatever era but there are definite differences. Glass feeding bottles for instance, rather than more durable plastic. Then there is a whole display on nappies, including an early version of disposables called Paddi Pads, invented by a mother living in Scotland who was pregnant with her fourth child. ""I can totally relate to her thinking 'I'm really fed up with boiling up lots of towelling nappies',"" says Lyn Stevens. ""It's really interesting that now that we have the choice, a lot of people are thinking of going back to the real nappies for environmental reasons and if they know they're planning to have more than one child it's also an economic reason.""

"The Surrey-based tycoon, 59, who has a 30% stake in Arsenal football club, owns iron ore producer Metalloinvest. Warner Music's Len Blavatnik comes next in the 25th annual list with £11bn but steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal's £10bn sees him drop from first to fourth. The 1,000 richest people in Britain and Ireland share a wealth of £450bn. The highest UK-born person in the list is the Duke of Westminster in eighth place with £7.8bn from property. He is the only person to make the top 10 of the list in each of its 25 years. Other Britons include Sir Philip and Lady Green, who are 16th in the list with £3.8bn from their retailing empire, and Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin brand, in 19th place, with £3.5bn. Former Miss UK Kirsty Bertarelli shares her £7.4bn pharmaceuticals fortune with husband Ernesto, the same amount as last year, but they have slipped three places down the list to ninth place. In third place are Sri and Gopi Hinduja, of the London-based global conglomerate Hinduja Group, with £10.6bn. Chelsea FC's Russian owner Roman Abramovich, who made his fortune in the oil industry, is down two places to fifth with £9.3bn. There are a record 88 billionaires in the list - compared to 77 last year and just nine when the rich list started in 1989, and the Queen was placed top. Her then wealth of £5.2bn included the Crown Estates and the royal art collection but since 1993 the Queen has been valued only on personal worth for the purposes of the list. The combined wealth of the top 200 people in list is £318.2bn which is more than eight times the figure 25 years ago. Mr Usmanov started his business empire with the manufacture of plastic bags. His interests now include Russia's biggest iron ore producer Metalloinvest, a stake in internet business mail.ru and a holding in mobile phone operator MegaFon which became listed on both the London and Moscow stock exchanges last year. Mr Usmanov owns Sutton Place in Surrey, the former home of the late oil baron J Paul Getty, as well as a £48m mansion in north London. Mr Blavatnik saw the biggest rise in wealth among those listed with an increase of £3.4bn over the past year. The Russia-born media mogul, who now holds US citizenship, sold his stake in Russian oil and gas giant TNK-BP for £2bn last month. India-born Mr Mittal, who topped the list for the past eight years, was the biggest faller in wealth terms after his 40% stake with his wife in steelmaker ArcelorMittal plunged from a peak of £28bn to just under £6bn. Earlier this month former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney was revealed to have topped the Sunday Times Rich List of musicians with the £680m fortune he shares with his wife Nancy Shevell. Sir Paul, whose American heiress wife is said to be worth £150m, has topped each music list since 1989 when he was worth an estimated £80m.

"By Katherine SellgrenFamily & Education reporter Anne Longfield says children have a right to education and, must not be an ""afterthought"", and that schools should be ""first to open, last to close"". She says children play a smaller role in spreading Covid-19 than adults and are less likely to get ill from it. The government says getting children back to school is a national priority. Ms Longfield has published a briefing setting out key actions needed to ensure children are ""at the heart of planning for the future"". The children's commissioner acknowledges that reducing Covid-19 transmission in the community is very important ""but it should not be automatically assumed that this requires closing schools - except as a last resort"". The briefing paper calls for the regular testing of pupils and teachers so that any confirmed Covid-19 cases - and their close contacts - can be isolated ""without necessarily having to send entire classes or year groups home"". It adds: ""This will be particularly important in the 2020/21 winter flu season when clusters of flu could be mistaken for a Covid-19 outbreak and result in unnecessary closure or interruption."" She says the Department for Education should expand its laptop programme in the event that pupils need to work online. Consideration should also be given to those children taking exams next summer so they are not disadvantaged, particularly in the case of extended local lockdowns. The briefing paper warns there is risk that some children will struggle to come back to school after a period away, and that this could lead to truancy and challenging behaviour. The DfE should closely monitor attendance and exclusion figures within areas that have experienced a local lockdown or increasing cases of Covid-19, in order to identify where further help is needed, it says. Ms Longfield also raises concerns that children in young offender institutions and secure training centres have been spending more than 20 hours a day in their cells, family visits have been banned, and face-to-face education has stopped. And she suggests the government holds a news conference aimed at children, giving them the chance to submit questions to press briefings, just as adults were in the previous daily briefings. She said: ""Too often during the first lockdown, children were an afterthought,"" adding: ""If the choice has to be made in a local area about whether to keep pubs or schools open, then schools must always take priority."" Schools minister Nick Gibb told BBC Breakfast that children would be going back to school in September, ""including those subject to local lockdowns"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""Schools will be open for all pupils from September and we're now looking locally when we impose new restrictions and will depend on things locally."" Parents 'hope for September' Mother of three Joe Watson, who has been shielding due to severe asthma, says her children would love to go back to school. ""We would love them to go back to school in September, that's my absolute hope for them - they miss their friends so much. ""We're saying to them that they're probably going to go back, but at the same time, we have to keep an eye on the data and the statistics to check to see whether it's safe enough."" Lorraine Hopkinson has an 11-year-old son who is due to start secondary school in September. ""Everyday I'm looking for reassurance so I can increase that confidence to send him to school,"" she says. ""If we get to the beginning of September and I don't feel that all of the issues that are currently bothering me have been resolved, I may say, 'Sorry, I can't send him in.'"" However, Professor Neil Ferguson, who resigned from the government's SAGE committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme things were likely to get more difficult going into autumn and winter, with people spending more time indoors and the virus transmitting more efficiently in colder weather. He said he was reasonably confident that - now we have ""good enough surveillance"" - transmission could be contained but said: ""It will be challenging and there will be no going back to anything close to normal social interactions, at least not until we get back to next spring, potentially the availability of a vaccine."" He said while there was little risk of transmission in primary schools, secondary schools, colleges and universities posed a ""risk of amplification of transmission"" as older teenagers may spread the virus like adults. Schools needed to have a plan in place on how to continue education but reduce those contacts at school based level, ""perhaps through partial attendance"", he added, for example with children in school one week on, one week off. Labour leader Keir Starmer wrote in the Guardian that the ""priority must be reopening schools for the new term"" and urged the government to ""set out a clear plan this time, not just hope for the best"". ""If that means making hard decisions elsewhere, so be it: to govern is to choose."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""School leaders are currently preparing their schools for all children to return in September, and are following all the government and health guidance they have been given in order to make it as safe as possible. ""But the success of September's return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within."" Teresa Heritage, vice-chairwoman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said councils would continue to work with all schools and local partners.","Schools should be the last places to shut in future lockdowns, after non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants, England's children's commissioner says."
"Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz said top positions in the Territorial Defence Force had already been decided. The force will have civilian volunteers trained in military skills. It is aimed at countering ""hybrid"" warfare of the kind that led parts of Ukraine to break away and pledge loyalty to Russia. Nato also plans to reinforce Poland. One Nato battalion will be deployed to Poland and three more to the neighbouring Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The total troop deployment is expected to be about 4,000, on a rotating basis. A Nato summit in Warsaw on 8-9 July will finalise the details of that deployment. Several of Nato's 28 member states will send troops to beef up the alliance's presence in the east, near the Russian border. Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula in March 2014 and the insurgency by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine sent a chill through Nato members who used to be in the Soviet bloc. Russia has also deployed Iskander-M nuclear-capable missiles to Kaliningrad, a territory sandwiched between Poland and the Baltic states. In April, Mr Macierewicz said the new Territorial Defence Force was needed because Poland ""is threatened by the actions of our neighbour Russia, which makes no secret of its aggressive intentions and which since 2008 has systematically been undertaking action aimed at destabilising the peaceful order in Europe"". On Thursday he announced a September recruitment drive, at a conference of paramilitary organisations in Ostroda, northern Poland. Launch in late 2016 - by the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw The idea of resurrecting Poland's territorial defence units gained traction following Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine. When Mr Macierewicz signed the document initiating the volunteer defence system in a Warsaw secondary school in April, he said the units would serve to defend against Russian aggression and to promote patriotism. He said Poland was the only Nato member without such a force. Warsaw abandoned its Soviet-era territorial units in 2008. Volunteers will undergo about 30 days' military training a year and the first three brigades are scheduled to be operational in eastern Poland by the start of next year, with the remaining 14 in the rest of the country expected to be ready in 2019. One of the first three brigades will defend Poland's border with Kaliningrad. The war in Ukraine triggered discussion about the territorial units in both Poland and the Baltic states, which already have them. One of the main concerns is the threat of a hybrid attack, a combination of conventional and unconventional warfare and cyber warfare. The Baltic region has experienced heightened military tension in recent months, with Nato complaining of aggressive behaviour by Russian air force jets. Russian Foreign Ministry department chief Andrei Kelin, quoted by Reuters news agency, said the deployment of four Nato battalions to the region ""would be a very dangerous build-up of armed forces pretty close to our borders"". Russia has announced plans to send three new military divisions to areas close to its western and southern borders. Military sources quoted by Russian media say they are likely to be motorised rifle formations of about 10,000 soldiers each. Next week some existing Polish paramilitary units will take part in a Nato defensive military exercise in Poland called Anaconda 2016.","Poland says it will start recruiting in September for a new 35,000-strong paramilitary defence force because of tensions with Russia."
"The proposal by Labour councillors aims to combat pollution and reduce child road deaths. It will be debated by a city council committee on 1 November. An idea by the Green Party to pilot closing roads was rejected in 2016. Liverpool Green Party leader Tom Crone said passing the latest motion would be a ""first step to addressing the air pollution crisis in our city"". Liverpool is among 30 places in the UK that exceed air pollution limits set by the World Health Organization, with high levels of fine air particle pollution. This can cause severe health problems because it penetrates the lungs and cardiovascular system. 'Clean air zones' More than 200 deaths have been linked to air pollution in the city per year. Labour councillors have asked for a feasibility study on the idea to shut roads to school-run traffic, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Analysis By Claire Hamilton, political reporter, BBC Merseyside It's the most frantic time of the day, but it can also be the most dangerous. For people living near schools it can be inconvenient to have two intensely busy periods of traffic. Signs around schools encourage parents to drive slowly or park considerately. Some operate informal one-way systems during peak times or hold ""walk to school weeks"" to try to cut car usage. But many parents still need to drive to work after dropping the kids at school. If this plan does succeed, the cars may just end up congesting roads slightly further away from the gates. Current plans to reduce congestion and pollution in Liverpool include introducing ""red routes"" where it would be illegal for vehicles to stop on three major routes. The council said it is also making changes to its own fleet of vehicles to make it more energy-efficient. It is also working with the taxi trade to reduce emissions by phasing out less environmentally-friendly engines. Mr Crone has called on the Labour-run council to take bolder action, such as introducing ""clean air zones"" where vehicles could potentially be charged for entering the city centre.",Roads around primary schools in Liverpool could be closed to traffic at the start and end of the school day.
"Southern Water said repairs to the sewer in Posbrook Lane, Titchfield, Hampshire, which burst on Thursday, have been ""complex"". Raw sewage from the broken pipe has caused contamination and damage to nearby gardens and fields. The water company said the temporary plug would allow it to plan a permanent repair. The sewer handles 600 litres of water every second at peak times, the firm said. ""This means that isolating the main for more than a few minutes at a time, to make repairs, is very difficult,"" it added. It apologised to anyone affected and said its priority was to ensure the environment was protected. The Environment Agency said it was investigating and would continue to ""closely monitor the situation"".",A temporary fix has been made to a collapsed sewer that has been leaking wastewater for five days.
"Japan's Nikkei 225 index finished the session up 2.7% to 21,317.3 points, led by the tech sector. The US last week announced proposed tariffs against China, which sent global markets tumbling. But China's premier Li Keqiang said on Monday that China and the US should maintain negotiations.

Tariff talk US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs against Chinese goods on Thursday, saying they were a response to allegations of intellectual property theft by China. China then responded to news of the planned tariffs by saying it did not want a trade war, but it was ""absolutely not afraid"" of one. Some analysts have said if a full blown trade war is not averted, China could make things difficult for US companies doing business in China, among other measures, while others have said China is more likely to try and avoid escalating the problem. In response to US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports announced by Mr Trump earlier this month, China has already announced its own set of proposed tariffs worth $3bn. The US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports came into effect last week.","Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead and rose sharply on Tuesday, as hopes grew that a trade war between the US and China could be averted."

"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales Ministers in the coalition government can't agree whether control of stamp duty land tax should pass from Westminster to Wales, so they will consult industry on the proposal contained in the Silk commission report. The (Liberal Democrat) Chief Secretary, Danny Alexander, clearly wants to finish the jigsaw. The (Conservative) Welsh Secretary, David Jones, is rather more cautious and could probably cope if there were one or two Silk recommendations that got lost behind the sofa. Labour see the consultation as a delaying tactic, arguing that business has already been consulted. The UK government argues that consultation was confined to Wales and didn't assess opinion over the border. The consultation may or may not ease coalition tensions on the issue but one question stands out: what happens if the conclusions agree with one half of the coalition. Does the other half back down? Mr Alexander announced the consultation in a written ministerial statement to parliament here. Note the reference to ""early access to borrowing"" to enable the Welsh government to pay for improvements to the M4. This follows a similar move in Scotland, where a system of ""pre-payments"" has allowed Holyrood ministers to access finance before the Scotland Act comes into force. Given the delay in the UK government responding to the Silk report - originally promised by the end of Spring - I asked Danny Alexander to clarify when autumn finishes in the Treasury calendar. ""September or October"" came the reply. Make a note in your diaries now.","It is, according to the Treasury chief secretary, the last piece in the Silk jigsaw. (They'll be having Silk tea towels and mugs next)."
"The decision comes after 170,000 activists from around the world demanded action to help lesbians targeted for ""corrective rape"". The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza. Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder. ""To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,"" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death. She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. They say ""corrective rape"" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or ""correct"" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common. 'We need protection' Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement. She said it was important to get ""corrective rape"" classified as a hate crime. ""The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,"" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action. ""In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,"" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community. ""The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,"" he said. In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg. Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and rape, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.","South Africa is to set up a team to tackle hate crimes against gay people, the justice ministry says."
"Dev Naran was in his grandfather's Toyota, which had pulled up on the hard shoulder, but the lane was being used and the car was struck by a lorry. The boy died in the crash, between junctions five and six, in May 2018. Coroner Emma Brown said she had written to Highways England which told her smart motorways were ""significantly safer"" than standard ones. She wrote to the agency following the inquest into the death of the boy, from Leicester, which concluded on 11 October. The lorry was travelling at 56mph (90km/h) when it hit the rear of the Toyota near Birmingham, Ms Brown said in her report. Due to the geography of the stretch of road, she added the lorry driver ""only had a very short time"" to react. Hundreds of miles of motorways in England have been made ""smart"", which means the hard shoulder may be used as a running lane. In her report, Ms Brown said it was not known why Dev's grandfather had stopped on the hard shoulder which at the time was ""clearly marked"" as a running lane. When a hard shoulder is in use as a lane, a speed limit is displayed above it. A red cross is used if it is closed. Ms Brown said drivers ""may become confused"" despite signage. She also said Highways England had no system for automatic alerts to a stopped vehicle in a lane. Although a radar system is being developed, it is not being considered for hard shoulder lanes. Highways England said its ""deepest sympathies"" were with Dev's family but added it ""cannot urge drivers strongly enough to only stop on the motorway in an emergency"".

"There have been periods of independence as well as periods of domination by other countries. Several million people, half of them Jews, died in World War II. A new era began when Poland became an EU member in May 2004, five years after joining Nato and 15 years after the end of communist rule. It was the birthplace of the former Soviet bloc's first officially recognised independent mass political movement when strikes at the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980 led to agreement with the authorities on the establishment of the Solidarity trade union. The shoots of political freedom were trampled again 16 months later when communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law. But the movement for change was irreversible. Elections in summer 1989 ushered in eastern Europe's first post-communist government. The presence in the Vatican of Polish Pope John-Paul II was an important influence on the Solidarity movement throughout the 1980s. The Roman Catholic church remains a very potent force in Polish life. In the years between the end of communism and EU accession, power in Poland switched between the centre right and the centre left, but the 21st century has seen the rise of the more forthrightly conservative and Law and Justice Party. Success Poland has made major economic strides since the fall of communism, and especially since joining the EU. In 2009, when all the major European economies were contracting because of the credit crunch, Poland was the only country in Europe to experience economic growth. There has been marked success in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment. Germany is now Poland's biggest trading partner. There was a massive movement of workers to western Europe in the years after Poland joined the EU, but the exodus slowed down after the global economic crisis took hold. Poland still has a huge farming sector - agriculture accounts for about 60% of the country's total land area - but the sector remains hampered by inefficiency, structural problems and lack of investment. Warsaw's profile on the international stage was raised by its support for the US-led military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. More recently, it has found itself close to the front line in Russia's military campaign against Ukraine after the fall of that country's pro-Moscow government in 2014.","A nation with a proud cultural heritage, Poland can trace its roots back over 1,000 years. Positioned at the centre of Europe, it has known turbulent and violent times."
"Searches had been ongoing since witnesses saw a car floating in the river near Hoveringham, Nottinghamshire, on 1 February. Emergency services had located the car days later but struggled to reach it because of the fast flow of water caused by flooding. Nottinghamshire Police said relatives of the deceased had been informed. The force said specialist divers discovered the two bodies inside the vehicle after 10:30 GMT on Saturday. Insp Tim Ringer called it a ""difficult and complex"" operation. ""Underwater recoveries of this nature are always very challenging, but our divers' work has been further complicated by the very fast flowing water at the site,"" he added. ""It was simply not safe to attempt this work before today."" The car had been located using sonar technology days after the report but ""treacherous conditions"" prevented its recovery, police had said. Witnesses had reported seeing two occupants inside a car floating along the river after it left Hoveringham Road and entered the water. Eyewitness Pauline Bulpitt said at the time: ""It was quite shocking. My husband rushed to get his Wellington boots, hoping the car would come into the bank further up and we might be able to do something to help.

"The list includes former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan, the founder of Phones 4u John Caudwell and the hotelier Sir Rocco Forte. But Britain Stronger in Europe said Vote Leave could not find a business to officially back it, as those listed supported it in a ""personal capacity"". A referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU will be held on 23 June. Last month, bosses of 36 of the largest listed companies in Britain signed a letter urging voters to remain in the EU. Vote Leave also announced that its business council would be chaired by John Longworth, who resigned his role as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) earlier this month. The council, made up of business leaders, will talk to businesses around the country to make their argument for an EU exit. It will make the case that EU membership is holding back British business and will initially be made up of members from the board of campaign group Business for Britain. Analysis By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent The pro-Brexit camp has striven to counter the impression that most big companies prefer to remain in the EU. A third of FTSE 100 bosses publicly supported staying in last month. This business council, under the auspices of Vote Leave, tries to address that by bringing together entrepreneurs and former company leaders who all want Britain to quit the EU. There are some colourful names on the list and a few well-known bosses including the former HSBC boss Michael Geoghegan, Tim Martin from JD Wetherspoon and Phones 4u founder John Caudwell. Many, like Sir Stuart Wheeler and co-founder of Carphone Warehouse David Ross, have ties to UKIP and the Conservatives. But there are no current FTSE 100 chief executives or chairmen and only 13 out of the 250 signatories are women - including Sir Rocco Forte's sister Olga and his niece Alex Polizzi. Mr Longworth's resignation followed his suspension for saying the UK's long-term prospects could be ""brighter"" outside the EU when the BCC had an official position of neutrality on the referendum. Mr Longworth said: ""If we Vote Leave, liberated from the shackles of EU membership, jobs will be safer, Britain will be able to spend our money on our priorities and we can look forward to faster growth and greater prosperity in the future."" Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave's chief executive, said it had a ""growing list of business supporters"". Mr Elliott said: ""Vote Leave will make that case, that whilst the EU might be good for big multinationals, for smaller businesses it acts as a job destruction regulatory machine. ""Brussels hinders smaller businesses, particularly those firms who can't afford to lobby Brussels to curry favour. ""Jobs, wages and our economy will thrive when we take back control and Vote Leave."" But Business Secretary Sajid Javid, who is supporting the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, said businesses could see ""we are stronger, safer and better-off in a reformed EU"". ""Survey after survey shows that small businesses - the backbone of our economy - want to stay inside the EU rather than take a leap in the dark,"" he said. Sir Michael Rake, chairman of BT and a fellow supporter of the In campaign, said the majority of businesses were in favour of staying in the EU. And he said the Leave campaign were ""not coming forward"" with the recommendations of how the UK could operate if it we were to leave the union. ""Many of the options that are talked about - Norway, Switzerland, Canada - are not realistic,"" he said.

"CAS, which refers people to food banks if they struggle to feed themselves, reported that double the number of Scots were asking for help in a year. It said about half of those asking for help had experienced problems with their benefits. Other factors include redundancy, debt levels and food costs. Nearly 3,000 people in Scotland have so far received food parcels since April. The Trussell Trust operates six food banks in Scotland, with more due to open by the end of the year. Trussell Trust officials north of the border have this year begun to compile figures on the number of people accessing food parcels. While it is not possible to compare the level of assistance with last year, those working on the front line have reported a significant increase in recipients. Ewan Gurr, manager of the Dundee food bank (the largest in Scotland), said 1,188 people were given food parcels between April and September. He said more than 60% of recipients sought help because of benefit delays, but other reasons included redundancy and low incomes which cannot cover rising food costs. The charity Oxfam has reported that food costs have risen by 30.5% over the past five years. Mr Gurr said some people asking for help have large mortgages, and paying them as well as covering energy costs and feeding the children were a higher priority than feeding themselves. He said some parents using the food bank were even suffering from malnutrition. 'Turn the tide' Trussell Trust director Chris Mould said: ""The trust welcomes this report from Citizens Advice Scotland, which highlights a serious problem. ""The Trussell Trust foodbank network, with over 250 foodbanks around the UK, is under huge pressure to respond to the thousands of people thrown into crisis as a direct result of change and uncertainty about the support they receive from the welfare system. ""More and more people are falling through the cracks and urgent policy action is required to turn the tide."" Citizens Advice Scotland helped clients make more than 2,200 applications for charitable support in 2011-12, mainly for food but also for other essentials like electricity. That's twice the figure for 2009-10. The CAS report said: ""Evidence from Citizens Advice Bureaux and food banks suggest that problems and changes in the benefits system are the most important factors. ""A number of welfare changes are causing claimants to need food parcels, including changes to the social fund, Jobseeker's Allowance sanctions and the sickness benefit reassessment. ""With recent changes in tax credits and future changes to Disability Living Allowance and housing benefit, we expect the number of Scottish Citizens Advice Bureaux clients that require food parcels to increase further."" 'Dickensian situation' CAS chief executive Margaret Lynch said: ""The report reveals a Dickensian situation facing many of Scotland's low paid workers and people who rely on welfare benefits. ""The national minimum wage has failed to keep pace with the massive increase in food prices over the last five years, leaving many low income families facing food insecurity. ""The fact that 50% of those getting food parcels are working is shocking. The fact that the remaining 50% who rely on food parcels do so because their benefit payments are delayed or because of changes to their benefits entitlement is both avoidable and disgraceful."" She added: ""Sadly this indignity is about to be inflicted on many more of our fellow Scots as welfare changes begin to bite. ""The welfare state was set up to provide a safety net from cradle to grave. The safety net has been withdrawn and the task of feeding the poor once more falls to the churches and charitable organisations whose philanthropy once helped to feed the poor of the industrial revolution.""","Benefit delays and welfare reforms are driving a rising need for food parcels, according to Citizens Advice Scotland."

"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News The review by NHS England suggested the biggest 40 to 70 units - specialising in heart attacks, strokes and trauma - be called major emergency centres. It would leave the remaining 70 to 100 A&Es - known as emergency centres - to deal with less serious conditions. It also suggested changes to the way ambulance crews and the new 111 phone service work to ""decongest"" A&Es. Greater co-ordination between community services, such as GPs and pharmacists, would also help, it said. The measures have been put forward in response to the growing pressures on accident and emergency departments. Emergency conditions Patient numbers have risen by 50% in the past decade and last winter the problems got so severe that the NHS missed its four-hour waiting time target. Extra money has been set aside to help the NHS through this winter and the next one. But this review aims to set out the long-term vision for the service. Many of the proposals are already in operation somewhere and in essence the review is calling for this to be formalised across the system. For example, there are already a number of A&E units that act as major centres in everything but name. But by setting a target of having between 40 and 70 major emergency centres it means this will have to be extended across the health service. This is likely to end up a controversial process because of the fear some hospitals could lose services. NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, who led the review, said: ""A&E is creaking at the seams. It is not broken, but it is struggling. ""We need to change the way we work. But what we are suggesting here already exists in places, we are just trying to formalise it so it is available for everyone."" The review said there also needed to be further changes to the system if pressure was going to be relieved. About 40% of people who attend A&E do not need treating there. What is more, the problems developed by a fifth of patients who are eventually admitted to hospital with emergency conditions could have been avoided with better and earlier treatment in the community. The review said key to tackling these problems was ensuring patients got access to the services that were best suited to them first time. To achieve this, 111, which has been beset by problems since it was launched in April to replace NHS Direct, will need to be much more responsive, giving patients direct phone access to doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Ambulance crews will need to treat more patients at the scene to reduce the number of patients transferred to hospital. Service 'creaking' Meanwhile, there needs to be greater co-ordination between GPs, pharmacists and the network of minor injury clinics and walk-in centres to give patients 24/7 access to care outside of hospital. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour welcomed Sir Bruce's report but deplored ""the government's attempt to avoid presenting it to Parliament and abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in A&E"". ""Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter, as well as the longer term,"" he added. ""But they are failing to act and their response remains 'crisis, what crisis'? They are forcing A&Es to go into winter with too few nurses, doctors and beds."" He said the prime minister had ""made it harder to get a GP appointment, closed NHS walk-in centres and scrapped NHS Direct, leaving people with no alternative but to go to A&E"". Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said the review had presented a ""promising vision"". ""At present there is genuine confusion amongst some patients, who then opt for A&E as a safe default option,"" she added. College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Clifford Mann welcomed the proposals, although he said NHS chiefs would need to be careful the reorganisation of A&Es did not lead to ""detrimental"" increased journey times. He also said: ""Any plan to provide emergency care must be based upon an adequate number of appropriately skilled clinicians and on this matter the review is disappointingly silent."" The changes will now go out to consultation and the review team will spend the next six months looking at the cost and staffing implications before producing another report in the spring. It is likely to take three to five years before the overhaul is completed.","A two-tier A&E system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs say."

"Policy Exchange said the current arrangements were too expensive and had failed to cut re-offending. It says £70m would be saved if tagging were done by police or probation officers instead of private firms. The government said that from April new contracts for electronic monitoring would represent better value. The Future of Corrections report said much of the potential benefits of tagging had not been realised. Electronic monitoring of offenders, which includes ankle tags and satellite technology, is provided by companies G4S and Serco. The report says almost £70m a year would be freed up if the firms handed over the technology so that police and probation officers could monitor and fit the ankle tags instead. It said this would then pay for 2,000 probation officers or 1,200 additional police officers to work on offender management. The report added that officers should also be able to make recommendations to courts and prison governors on who ought to be tagged. 'Victims reassurance' Policy Exchange said that for each offender, electronic monitoring cost £13.14 per monitored day in England and Wales, while the equivalent in the US was £1.22. Rory Geoghegan, the report's author, said: ""Extending the use of tagging without these reforms will just see millions of pounds wasted and a real opportunity to cut crime missed."" Chris Miller, a former assistant chief constable who spoke for police chiefs on tagging, said: ""What we have been given instead is a sclerotic, centrally controlled, top-down system that has enriched two or three large suppliers, that lacks the innovation and flexibility of international comparators, and that fails to demonstrate either that it is value for money or that it does anything to reduce offending."" Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said new guidelines being introduced ""call for a smarter, more integrated approach that takes advantage of the latest technology"". ""Properly administered, new generation tagging can promote improved behaviour and give victims reassurance,"" he said. 'Robust alternative' The critical report comes after G4S was awarded a five-year £13m contract by the Scottish government last week to run hi-tech new tags with GPS technology, giving authorities the ability to continuously track offenders' whereabouts. Richard Morris, group managing director of G4S Care and Justice Services, said: ""The use of electronic monitoring in England and Wales actually saves the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds each year by providing a robust alternative to expensive prison custody for offenders who are deemed suitable for tagging. ""We have also worked closely with the Ministry of Justice over the years to introduce innovations and changes to the original service which have resulted in improved value for money."" G4S monitors more than 50,000 people in more than 15 countries, he added. Serco said it did not wish to comment.","The system of electronic monitoring of offenders in England and Wales should be changed to save millions of pounds, a think tank has suggested."
"Hamzah Khan died in Bradford in 2009. His body was found 21 months later. A forensic pathologist told Bradford Crown Court a baby-grow Hamzah was wearing that was made for a six to nine-month-old infant looked too big. Dr Matthew Lyall said the boy suffered from profound osteoporosis. His mother Amanda Hutton, 43, denies manslaughter. Dr Lyall told jurors he examined Hamzah's body in the cot where he was found. No injuries He described the body as being in a state of ""advanced mummification"". The court heard the child was still holding a toy. When asked whether the baby-grow fitted Hamzah, Dr Lyall told jurors, ""No, I actually thought the baby-grow looked slightly too big for the body."" Jurors were told that determining a cause of death was difficult due to the decomposition of the body. There were no signs of trauma to the head and neck, no stab wounds or fractures to ribs, they heard. Dr Lyall told the court Hamzah's osteoporosis ""was due to malnutrition and that there was no other credible explanation"". However, jurors were also told that a second forensic pathologist who examined Hamzah's body said the four-year-old could have suffered from rickets or scurvy. Accused wept The court was told further tests on Hamzah's body found his diet was ""grossly inadequate"" and that for one or two years before his death his diet lacked protein. Dr Lyall said: ""It's reasonable to conclude Hamzah was suffering from malnutrition and it was entirely possible that starvation could have contributed to his death."" Ms Hutton wept during the evidence and covered her face with her hands. The court previously heard she told police Hamzah was a difficult child and would refuse to eat but she thought she could handle it. She also told officers she did not seek help for her son because she had a fear of doctors and hospitals. The trial was adjourned until Friday, when jurors were told they would hear further medical evidence.

"The total population is now estimated to be less than 500 breeding pairs. The situation is even worse south of the border where the iconic bird of prey is said to be heading to the brink of extinction. The latest survey found 460 breeding pairs in Scotland in 2016 compared with more than 500 when the previous study was carried out six years earlier. The RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish Raptor Study Group, along with a range of other UK partners carried out the survey. It found Scotland remained a major stronghold for hen harriers, with 80% of the UK population. However, having a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 birds makes the species vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and, in some areas, wildlife crime. 'High priority' The west Highlands continue to provide a home for the majority of Scotland's breeding harriers, while Orkney and the Hebrides were the only areas of the country to show a slight increase in the number of the birds. A major project aimed at maintaining their population has also been carried out at Langholm Moor in Dumfries and Galloway. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: ""The hen harrier is an indicator of the health of our upland environment, and the fact that its population continues to decline is of major concern. ""The hen harrier is a high priority for our conservation work and urgent steps need to be taken to tackle illegal killing of this species and to improve their moorland breeding habitats."" Eileen Stuart, SNH's head of policy and advice, said the decline was a ""serious concern"". She said they were committed to working with others to tackle wildlife crime throughout the country. 'Spectacular raptor' ""There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland,"" added Wendy Mattingley of the Scottish Raptor Study Group. ""For the population to begin to recover and expand over all suitable habitat, the intensively managed grouse moors of east and south Scotland must produce successful breeding hen harriers again. ""The hen harrier is a wonderful spectacular raptor and more action must be taken to ensure that its future is secure."" Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, said the decline was disappointing but said it would be working to better understand the reasons behind poor breeding and help to rebuild the harrier population. Simon Wotton, lead author of the study, described the survey as a ""monumental effort"". ""We hope these results will convince everyone in a position to help hen harriers to take positive steps to ensure their protection and rebuild the country's population for people to enjoy for generations to come,"" he said.","Hen harrier numbers have fallen by 9% in Scotland since 2010, according to the latest national survey."

"By How To SayAn occasional guide to words and names in the news It's a big word for a big beast. Weighing more than 15 tonnes and broad around the hips, the diplodocus was quite an animal. Generations of UK dinosaur enthusiasts have grown up speaking of a ""DIP-lo-DOH-cus"". CBeebies presenter Andy Day recently did the same in a rap song dedicated to the long-necked herbivore. The poem I'm a Diplodocus, by Judith Nicholls, distributed to primary schools in 2005, also emphasised the first and third syllables, in one stanza stating: Hocus, pocus, plodding through the swamp; I'm a diplodocus, chomp, chomp, chomp! But some, particularly in the scientific community, prefer to call the diplodocus, which lived in North America about 150 million years ago, the ""dip-LOD-er-cus"". The BBC's Walking With Dinosaurs did this in 1999, as per the BBC Pronunciation Unit's advice. The Oxford English Dictionary rules that both pronunciations are valid. But the Natural History Museum, which is moving its own diplodocus model, conveniently named Dippy, offers its own, third version - ""DIP-low DOCK-us"". It says this is because its name is the combination of the two Greek words - diplos (double) and dokos (beam), a reference to the formation of bones on the underside of its tail. The BBC's Pronunciation Unit is also aware of a fourth possibility - ""digh-PLOD-uh-kuhss"" - the ""digh"" sounding like ""high"". The first diplodocus remains were discovered in 1877 by another pronunciation poser, Yale University's Othniel Charles Marsh. The American Journal of Science was using the word as early as 1884. Paul Upchurch, professor of palaeobiology at University College London, says ""dip-LOD-er-cus"" is used by experts from all over the world. ""If I stand up on a stage and say it at a conference, it's the way of saying it that's going to seem the least weird,"" he adds. But he thinks the pronunciation favoured by children is possibly more technically correct. ""Dinosaur names are made up from Latin and Greek, so they're not real old words,"" Crispin Little, a palaeontology lecturer at Leeds University. ""It's up to you how you pronounce them."" Visitors to the National History Museum often ask for the correct pronunciation of Dippy's full name. ""Our lead scientist prefers DIP-low-DOCK-us, but it's a word that you can't say wrong, basically,"" a spokeswoman says. The diplodocus model is to be replaced with the skeleton of a blue whale - pronounced ""bloo whayl"" with no variants, according to the OED.

"By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent Five peregrine falcon chicks are currently fledging on the nest, perched high up on the steep walls of a rural quarry. It is the first time such a number has been recorded at a single site. It has been described as a ""once in a lifetime event"" which has never been seen before in Northern Ireland. Peregrines are one of the world's fastest birds, reaching speeds of up to 200mph as they dive steeply on their prey, which mainly consists of feral pigeons and collared doves. The chicks were discovered by friends Lindsay Hodges and Christine Cassidy, who are members of the NI Raptor Study Group. They said it was an ""incredibly exciting"" moment when they realised they had five young at what has been a productive nest site in recent years. ""I was doing some filming when the fifth head popped up. It was wonderful and the parents have done such an exceptional job to raise five,"" Ms Hodges said. Unionist assembly member Jim Wells has been surveying peregrine falcon nest sites for decades. He said he has never seen as big a brood in all those years. ""I suspect I'll never see the like again,"" he added. He put it down to a lack of disturbance due to the Covid-19 lockdown and excellent spring weather, which gave the chicks the best possible chance to thrive. There are about 90 pairs of peregrine in Northern Ireland, many in quarries where they nest on the steep walls. There are a few persecution hotspots, but generally the birds are actively looked after by people who know where they are, including quarry owners. ""A lot of them don't make it naturally because of cold winters or poor feeding...but overall it's a stable population that is doing well and this year because of the lockdown and the good weather it has been a particularly good season,"" Mr Wells said. He expects only a couple of the chicks to make it through to full adulthood when they will return to the area to raise their own young. Mr Wells said the discovery was the equivalent of a 147 break in snooker or a nine-dart finish. The location is being kept secret to protect the nest and prevent disturbance. The BBC and the NI Raptor Study Group have permission under a licence from the NI Environment Agency to record the birds.",A record has been set with the biggest brood of chicks raised in Northern Ireland by one of our most impressive birds of prey.

"By Kevin MageeBBC Northern Ireland business correspondent The move follows an NIHE investigation into the company's work practices which included allegations of overcharging for jobs. The east Belfast-based firm carried out maintenance work on most Housing Executive properties in the city. It said it had ""robustly rebutted in detail"" the report. The housing executive said the contracts would end in three months. Following a 2010 BBC investigation into Red Sky's activities on some Housing Executive contracts, the housing body ordered a top-level inquiry into the contractor's work. A further, wider investigation has now concluded and the executive said it could confirm that the inquiry has highlighted what it called ""significant concerns about the company's performance, including overcharging"", but it refused to give further details. On Thursday, Red Sky said it was ""absolutely clear that the allegations are without substance and are prepared to demonstrate this if necessary in a court of law"". It added: ""Red Sky believes that NIHE did not properly consider the contents of Red Sky's reply in deciding on termination. ""Despite NIHE being presented with clear evidence last Thursday that Red Sky had not been overpaid, NIHE decided yesterday to unilaterally terminate all contracts. ""Red Sky is at a complete loss as to why NIHE has elected to act in this way and is seeking legal advice as to recourse for significant damage to its business."" The company said Red Sky Group and the jobs of its 400 employees in Belfast had been put at risk. Main contractors The contracts with the Housing Executive were worth several million pounds a year. Red Sky was one of the main contractors used by the executive. They had five contracts in four areas - south, east and west Belfast and Newtownabbey - to carry out repairs and provide fast response maintenance teams for a range of repairs. The company has been working with the executive since 2004. The BBC investigation discovered a number of executive tenants who were very unhappy about the level of service they received and the standard of repairs carried out to their homes. One woman who was compensated after Red Sky did some work on her house, said her home was wrecked by the people who were supposed to repair it. The investigation also uncovered evidence that Housing Executive staff repeatedly raised concerns about the company's standards of work, primarily in west Belfast. The Housing Executive said it would be putting in place the necessary arrangements to provide response maintenance services to its tenants. ""Red Sky Group has five separate contracts covering Housing Executive districts in Belfast and Newtownabbey,"" the Housing Executive said ""We can confirm that the investigations have highlighted significant concerns about the contractor's performance including overcharging.

"By Paul HeaneyBBC News They are worried mistakes could be made with vulnerable adults and children resulting in a situation like Baby P. Toddler Peter Connelly died in north London in 2007, after suffering more than 50 injuries. A report found he was ""failed by all agencies"". Some staff in Wales have 43 child cases to deal with, which Unison said is double the recommended number. Concern has also been raised over the ""relentless"" cutting of social work budgets. Councils said there was a real need for government ""at all levels"" to ensure the system can meet demand. The figures, which were obtained by BBC Wales, were described by the British Social Workers' Association (BASW) as ""worrying"". BBC Wales asked each council about social workers who had been allocated the most cases - and what their caseloads were. This included cases classed as being ""on review"" which may not need constant attention. One social worker in Ceredigion had 29 cases, while another in Conwy had 144. Conwy council said the 144 cases were adults and many did not require checking more than once a year. When asked specifically about child social work, seen by some as more complex cases, numbers ranged from 22 in Newport to 43 in Merthyr Tydfil and Gwynedd. Robin Moulster, from BASW said: ""I don't think I could guarantee with those sort of numbers that there couldn't be another big public inquiry. ""This may appear a bit overdramatic but I think sometimes it's a bit like 'there for the grace of God' that we haven't got another Baby P situation."" Mr Moulster said it should not have to wait until councils are put into special measures for issues to be addressed. He said he had heard of some councils with newly-qualified social workers given large caseloads ""in very high pressured areas of work"". ""There is a risk things can get missed and serious situations can happen,"" he added. Dominic MacAskill, head of local government for Unison, said there were some worrying signs. ""It's possible perhaps to retain a fairly large caseload and juggle things around a bit, but juggling is not appropriate in this type of profession,"" he said. Concern about the impact of ""relentless"" budget cutting was raised by Gwen Carrington from the Association of Directors of Social Services in Wales. ""We are very mindful that social care isn't being protected in the way that health is,"" she said. ""We are often treating the same people as the health service, but our budgets are not protected. ""Given the scare resources, are we doing the right things with our money? The question is how sustainable is it in future?"" she added. The Welsh Local Government Association said budget cuts, rising demand and increasingly complex legislation would place ""a significant amount of strain on local social care services over the coming years. ""There is a very real need for government at all levels in Wales to continue to work closely with professional social care bodies to ensure Wales' social care system can meet current demand,"" said a spokesman. The Welsh government said it was investing an additional £10m in local government funding in ""recognition of increasing demand for social services"" and taking other steps with its Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act to help reduce pressure on services.",A warning that some social workers in Wales have workloads which are too high has been raised by unions.
"The £756m project would see a six-mile-long U-shaped seawall run from Swansea docks to near the site of Swansea University's new Fabian Way campus. The firm behind it, Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Ltd, said the scheme could generate 420,000 MWh of energy per year - enough to supply 121,000 homes. The developer commissioned a report by Cardiff University. Its Welsh Economy Research Unit found if the lagoon is completed to time - by 2017 - it would equate to around 1,850 full time equivalent jobs across the region for the three year construction period. There would also be 60 long-term operational jobs and up to 90 additional jobs linked to visitor spending. The unit says the lagoon would create over £5m annual local spend during the operational phase. ""The focus of job creation and support in manufacturing and construction sectors is important in the context of current challenges facing the Swansea Bay and Welsh economies,"" said Professor Max Munday, director of the Welsh Economy Research Unit. He added: ""It is important to note that Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is the first of an expected network of projects and construction, and manufacturing employment connected with this first build could possibly be used in future lagoon builds in Wales and elsewhere."" Supply chain hub Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay, said the project wants to work with the Welsh industry to ensure the region capitalises on the development. He wants to see the Swansea region become the supply chain hub for all tidal lagoons and are looking into a large scale assembly facility in the Swansea city region. ""We are confident from our work so far with representatives of Welsh industry that Wales has the skills base, experience and scalability to serve a larger UK tidal lagoon industry,"" he added. The planned lagoon, which would take about two years to build, would comprise an impounding ""breakwater or seawall"" capable of holding 11 square kms (4 sq miles) of water. It would hold on to water and then let it out through turbines at both high and low tides which would generate electricity. At low tide, water would flow from the lagoon into the sea, and from the sea into the lagoon at high tide.

"The volume of sales fell 0.1% on the month, after a 0.2% drop in February. The year-on-year reading showed a worse-than-expected 2.4% drop, underlining fears about the eurozone's economic growth in recent months. Eurostat said that there was a fall in spending on items such as clothes and computers in the 17-nation euro bloc. Last week the European Commission forecast that euro-area growth would shrink by 0.4% during 2013, down from 0.3% forecast in February. The figures underline the bloc's struggle with record joblessness and limited economy growth. According to the Eurostat data, Spain saw the biggest fall, with retail sales down 10.5% compared with the same month last year. Weak consumer spending is a concern for the European Central Bank, which lowered its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.5% last week. Unemployment across the eurozone is expected to hit an average of 12.2% this year. There have been growing calls for countries to ease up on austerity measures, amid fears that stringent budget cuts are hindering growth. On Monday, France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici said that the dogma of austerity was over. He told French radio that a more ""responsible attitude"" to austerity budget cuts was now in place.","Retail sales across the eurozone have fallen for the second month in a row in March, according to the European Union statistics agency Eurostat."
"Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) commissioned a pilot study of public perceptions of wild deer. Surveys were carried out and the results of these have been published in a new report. The study suggested positive feelings towards deer are widespread, but leaned towards Highland red deer populations. The research said urban populations were seen as a nuisance. Roe deer are mainly found in towns and cities. Muntjac deer, a non-native species, has been deemed such a serious threat to crops and road safety that SNH urged deer managers to ""shoot on sight"" muntjac in the south of Scotland. SNH has estimated that if a muntjac population became established in Scotland it could cost up to £2m-a-year to manage. Welfare concerns Red deer were romanticised by English painter Sir Edwin Landseer's 1851 oil-on-canvas painting, Monarch of the Glen. Results of another SNH-commissioned survey published in 2011 suggested that deer were the type of wildlife the public associated most with Scotland. Consultants interviewed 1,055 people to gather views on species, habitats and management of wildlife. The results showed 73% of respondents associated deer with Scotland. SNH's newly-published pilot study also suggested that survey respondents had an understanding of, and mixed opinions about, stalking. People recognised economic importance of hunting but also raised moral and welfare concerns, the report said. The surveys also found wide support for the production of venison.","Red deer are seen in a positive light by the public while other species can be regarded as a pest, new research has suggested."

"Stoptober, backed by Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation, hopes a united effort will help many of England's eight million smokers to quit successfully. Research shows people who stop smoking for 28 days are five times more likely to stay smoke-free. It also shows mass movements and mass media campaigns can have a big impact. Public health experts say campaigns that include a combination of hard-hitting ""why to quit"" and supportive ""how to quit"" messages work best. Giving up smoking can be difficult. People are much more likely to quit successfully if they get support than if they try to do it alone and go cold-turkey. Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, told the BBC there was good reason to set up a mass movement to help smokers quit because people are ""social animals"" influenced by each other. Smokers who join Stoptober are given free support to help them quit. There is a mobile phone app that can monitor quitters' progress and the offer of daily motivational texts to keep them on track. There is also a Stoptober Facebook page where people can exchange ideas and get additional tips and advice. According to the Department of Health, smoking is the biggest cause of premature death in England and accounts for over 100,000 deaths in the UK each year. One in two long-term smokers will die from a smoking-related disease.",Smokers are being asked to give up smoking for 28 days from 1 October in the first mass quit attempt.
"Capt Vladyslav Voloshyn had called the Russian allegation a lie. Dutch investigators concluded that a Russian Buk missile had destroyed the Boeing 777 jet, killing 298 people. Reports say Voloshyn shot himself at home in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea. Ukraine described him as a war hero. He had flown 33 combat missions in a low-flying Su-25 ground attack jet against Russian-backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, and had been granted a medal for bravery. Recently the 29-year-old had been in charge of the Mykolaiv airport, after resigning from the air force. The southern city near Odessa is called Nikolayev by Russian speakers. A statement from Mykolaiv police on Facebook (in Ukrainian) described Voloshyn's death as ""suicide"", but it is being investigated under the ""premeditated murder"" section of Ukraine's penal code. A military service pistol was found at the scene and is now being examined by experts. Why is the MH17 disaster controversial? The airliner, with 298 passengers and crew, was shot down on 17 July 2014 over war-torn eastern Ukraine. More than two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. After pro-Russian rebels launched their insurgency in April 2014 several Ukrainian jets were shot down by them, yet many international airlines continued flying over the conflict zone. MH17's high-altitude flight path was thought to be safe, despite warnings about the rebels' missile capability. Russian officials not only alleged that Voloshyn's plane had shot down MH17. According to another Russian theory, it was a Ukrainian military Buk missile - no longer in service in Russia - that downed the airliner. Independent experts - besides the Dutch-led team - rejected the Russian claims, saying the evidence pointed to a Buk fired by pro-Russian rebels or a Russian military unit. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) wants to put the suspects on trial in the Netherlands, but that is fraught with legal difficulties. Ukrainian and US intelligence sources said the Buk system had been sent into rebel territory by Russia, then moved out again. Family members quoted by Ukrainian media said Voloshyn had been feeling depressed. They were in the flat when he shot himself on Sunday and his wife heard the shot. An ambulance was called but he died in hospital. A Ukrainian journalist who knew Voloshyn well, Yuriy Butusov, praised him on Facebook (in Russian) as an exemplary pilot who had fought bravely against the Russian-backed rebels in the Donbass region. Butusov expressed bewilderment over Voloshyn's death. ""Dear Vlad, how can this be?! Why?!"" he wrote. ""He didn't let himself break down, he wasn't depressed at all - he always acted as an exemplary officer."" According to Butusov, Voloshyn had bombed Russian paratroops during the battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014, one of the bloodiest in the Donbass conflict. More than 300 Ukrainian soldiers died in the fighting there. Voloshyn was shot down but ejected from his Su-25, and reached Ukrainian lines despite severe injuries, Butusov said. ""I didn't hear him speak of any enemies or unresolved problems,"" he wrote, adding that Voloshyn was happily married and adored his wife, his little boy and two-year-old girl.","A Ukrainian military pilot blamed by Russia over the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 has killed himself, Ukrainian media report, quoting police."
"Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) said the recommendation made in a study by consultants had been accepted in principal by its board. The project would be the first of its kind in the UK. Unmanned towers at the airports would feed information to the central hub at Inverness Airport. The towers would be located at Sumburgh in Shetland, Dundee, Wick John O'Groats, Kirkwall in Orkney, and Stornoway and Benbecula in the Western Isles. Prospect, a union representing workers involved in air traffic control, has criticised the choice of Inverness for the hub. It said the high quality jobs would be lost at the other airports. Western Isles local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has raised similar concerns. 'Most compelling case' Hial said the centralised system would be phased in over a period of up to 10 years and that there were no planned reductions in staff numbers. The company, which is wholly owned by Scottish ministers, said air traffic control staff and unions, airport managers and senior personnel were involved throughout the process of identifying a location for the hub. The Scottish government and local politicians have also been kept informed, said Hial. Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: ""The scoping study identifies Inverness as having the most compelling case to support Hial's continued delivery of its core activities. ""We have also taken the views of our staff into account and Inverness was their preferred option should relocation be required. Inverness is best suited from a technical, operational and staffing perspective. ""Inverness is centrally located in relation to the other HIAL airports and has direct flights to Sumburgh, Kirkwall, Stornoway and Benbecula. It has road and rail connections with Dundee and Wick."" Hial's interim chair Lorna Jack said: ""We know that these changes will be challenging in those particular communities, but our overall aim is to future-proof the services that they depend on. ""We will now work with our colleagues and stakeholders to establish a centre of excellence that will deliver for the people and communities we serve."" Prospect negotiations officer, David Avery, said Hial's board had taken its decision without undertaking an assessment on the impact on local communities. He said: ""For our members this is far too late and it's clear that Hial intend to proceed regardless of what the report may tell them. ""Our members are highly skilled professional air traffic controllers who have significant operational and safety about the concept of remote towers and its implementation in Scotland. ""These views on the overarching direction of the project have been ignored at every stage by Hial."" Prospect has sought a meeting with Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss its concerns.",Inverness Airport has been identified as the preferred location for a centralised air traffic control hub for seven regional airports.
"Its shares fell as low as $398.11 in Wednesday trading, before ending the day down 5.5% at $402.80. The concerns were triggered after one of its suppliers, Cirrus Logic, which makes sound components for the iPhone and iPad, reported a decline in sales. With Apple due to release its latest quarterly results next week, some fear the numbers may be underwhelming. According to various estimates, demand from Apple accounts for nearly 90% of Cirrus's revenue. Michael Yoshikami, a portfolio manager at Destination Wealth Management, said that Cirrus's warning makes it more likely that ""Apple's not going to surprise on upside"". Under pressure Apple which enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, has been facing increasing pressure lately, both from rivals as well as investors. While the sales of its popular iPhone and iPad have grown - they have fallen short of market expectations - and its market share has been declining. At the same time, its biggest rival Samsung has been steadily increasing its market share, both in the smartphone and tablet PC sectors. According to research by Gartner, in the final quarter of 2012 Samsung sold 64.5 million smartphones to Apple's 43.5 million. Samsung also doubled its share of the tablet PC market to 15.1% in the last three months of 2012, while Apple saw its share slide to 43.6% from 51.7%, despite seeing a jump in sales, data released by IDC earlier this year showed. At the same time, some analysts have also been disappointed over the delay in launch of new products by the company. There are rumours that the release of the company's next iPhone may not be until September, rather than in June as had been earlier expected. To add to its woes, a brand survey released by consultancy Added Value in March showed that Apple is perceived as less ""inspiring"" than it was three years ago. Meanwhile, Samsung is now seen as equally inspiring in the US. That has led many investors to fear that Apple may be losing its dominance and as a result its revenues and profits may be hurt. ""There's not a lot of conviction about what the second half is going to look like,"" said Shannon Cross of Cross Research. All these concerns have seen investors ditch Apple's stock. Its shares have fallen more than 40% since hitting their peak in September 2012.",Shares of Apple dipped below the $400 mark for the first time since December 2011 amid concerns over slowing sales.
"David Gregory-KumarReality Check, BBC News Did Labour bankrupt the country? Christopher Oxford tweeted: ""Mr Cameron has repeatedly claimed that Labour 'bankrupted the country'. Is this in any way true?"" Well, the first problem with this question is what do the Conservatives mean by this allegation? Unlike with individuals, there is no clear definition of when a country might be declared bankrupt. The standard definition of being bankrupt is when you cannot pay your debts. The UK never defaulted on its debts so, by that definition, the country was never bankrupt. On the other hand, under Labour public sector net debt rose significantly (for a variety of reasons) and it is certainly arguable the economy as a whole was in a very precarious situation. But, technically at least, not bankrupt. How accurate are the polls anyway? Mike Harvey tweeted: ""The polls say we're going to have a hung parliament but, historically speaking, how accurate are they?"" Well, we do like a poll here at BBC Reality Check - but should we put so much faith in them? How have they performed in the past when it comes to predicting the results of previous elections? There are certainly more polls during the course of the campaign these days, but traditionally it is the last poll from each company before the actual vote that is used to judge their performance. Aside from 1992, Major v Kinnock, all the major companies have called the correct party share of the vote in the last few elections. Interestingly, while pollsters seem to do well at predicting the Conservative and Liberal Democrat share of the vote they do tend to overestimate the share of the vote Labour will get. Except in 2010, when it was understated. This slight fuzziness around predictions for Labour could mean this election has some surprises in store. One final note - this is all about correctly predicting the share of the vote. That then has to be transferred into actual seats and that adds another layer of complexity and confusion. So the polls are usually pretty accurate, but, as the cliché goes, there is really only one poll that matters. Does the weather affect election turnout? Martin McElroy tweeted: ""Does weather affect turnout and which party does it benefit?"" This question has lead me to my favourite scientific paper ever: ""The rain in Spain: Turnout and partisan voting in Spanish elections"" The conclusions are remarkably similar to what American research into this issue has discovered. According to the Spanish paper, ""rainfall on election day decreases turnout... second stage results show that conservatives are greatly hurt by higher turnout"". Academics at Stanford came to broadly the same conclusion. But they also go on to point out that while politicians can't control the weather, they can try and control voter turnout: ""Democrats should act to increase voter turnout while Republicans should act to suppress turnout."" Seasoned watchers of the American political system might argue both sides employ various ways to try and do just that. Finally, that Spanish paper notes there was one major difference to the experience of the American two party system. In Spain, as the turnout went up it seemed to benefit a raft of smaller parties rather than the main left-wing opposition. So where does that leave us? Well, according to Stephen Fisher from Oxford University, the weather does not seem to have an impact on our elections. But it does give you something to talk about when you visit the polling station.","We hope you have found our BBC Reality Check service useful over the course of the campaign, and before we go, here are some final questions you have sent in via social media."
"By Alun JonesBBC Wales news The number on the register increased from 5,368 in 2011 to 6,464 in 2012. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) cited better technology used to catch sex offenders as a possible reason for the rise. The information was obtained in a Freedom of Information request by BBC Wales' Newyddion Ar-lein. Between 2009, when there were 3,908 on the register, and 2012 there was an increase of 65%. A spokesman for Acpo said: ""There are a number of possible reasons for the increases. ""Improved technology, improved inter-agency working and a very robust approach to allegations of sexual offences is resulting in more convictions. ""Improved treatment of victims for example through Sexual Assault Referral Centres is resulting in more historical complaints of abuse which are also being rigorously followed up. ""Actions of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre and preventative campaigns regarding the use of the internet, social networking etc is resulting in more complaints which are being followed up rigorously."" He added that ""improved technology is providing evidence of internet offences"" for example of offences of child sex abuse. It has also emerged that a significant number of people on the Sex Offenders Register in Wales failed to comply with the requirements of the register. This includes not notifying of a change of address, going abroad and not returning, failing to register on release from prison within required period and use of the internet in breach of court condition. The Acpo spokesman added: ""Part of the reason for the increase in 'failures to comply' is due to a zero tolerance approach and better links between police, prison and probation services which allows 'failures to comply' to be identified very quickly and actioned on.""","The number of people on the Sex Offenders Register in Wales has risen 20% between 2011 and 2012, the BBC has learned."
"Concerns about stricter UK regulations led Europe's biggest bank to launch a review into whether to move elsewhere, with Hong Kong seen as the most likely alternative. But the bank said it had decided unanimously against the move and that London ""offered the best outcome for our customers and shareholders"". The decision was seen as a vote of confidence for the UK. The bank has had its headquarters in the UK since 1993 but makes most of its money overseas, and Asia accounts for the majority of its profit. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, told the Today programme: ""London offered the best of both worlds for us. HSBC at its heart is a bank focused on trade and investment flows. ""The UK is one of the most globally connected economies in the world with a fantastic regulatory system and legal system and immense experience in dealing with international affairs,"" Mr Flint said. ""The government's made very clear its commitment to ensuring that that UK remains a leading international financial centre ... We've ended up with the best of both worlds - a pivot to Asia led from London."" HSBC is understood to have paid about £30m to advisors to help it reach the decision to remain based in London. 'Regrettable' decision HSBC shares rose 1.36% in Monday's trading in London to 446.4p, but have fallen 17% this year. The bank's Kong Hong-listed shares closed 4% higher on Monday. However, analysts at Investec said HSBC's decision was ""regrettable"" because it faced tighter regulations and the cost of the UK bank levy. ""We see HSBC's announcement as a missed opportunity,"" said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. HSBC had been paying £1bn a year through the UK banking levy before the government changed the tax last year. Bank levy Mr Flint said ""it was important that there was a change in the scope of the levy"". ""A levy based on an international balance sheet was a disincentive for a global group, and we made that point ever since the start of the levy. It was good to see that the scope of the levy changed to being a domestic impost, and that was important,"" the HSBC chairman said. However, Mr Flint denied that HSBC had forced the government's hand in changing the banking levy. ""We had no negotiation with the government. The government was well aware of our view, and indeed the view of many other people who commented upon it, but there certainly was no pressure put, or negotiation."" He added that the regulatory regime had ""not been softened"". HSBC's decision was based on ""a generational view"" and not on ""short-term dynamics"", Mr Flint said. ""It [the decision to stay] was based on a very thoughtful perspective on how economics will play out over the next 20 [to] 25 years,"" he said. 'Ideally positioned' HSBC said that London had an ""internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system"" and added that it also was ""home to a large pool of highly skilled, international talent"". It was therefore ""ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC"". Part of the review was considering whether the increased regulation of the banking industry in the UK - in particular the increased tax burden - warranted moving elsewhere. But in the last Budget, the Chancellor George Osborne introduced a gradual reduction in the bank levy on balance sheets - a move which particularly affected HSBC, because of its large balance sheet. In 2014 it paid £750m of the £1.9bn raised by the government through that particular tax. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor For HSBC itself, the decision wasn't just about the tax environment in the UK. There was also the problem of the regulatory environment in China - with the central bank causing nervousness among investors and volatility in the markets after intervening in the stock and currency markets. Poorer news about the Chinese economy also focused minds at HSBC's Canary Wharf headquarters in London's docklands. One interesting point to make about the decision is that whatever fears HSBC has about Britain possibly leaving the European Union, London's attraction as a financial capital was more significant. Which raises a challenge for those who argue that businesses could quit the UK if Britain were to leave the EU. Read Kamal in full The board added that it had also decided to end the practice of reviewing the location of the group's headquarters every three years, and would only revisit the matter if there was ""a material change in circumstances"". 'Vote of confidence' It stressed that Asia remained ""at the heart of the group's strategy"" and that it was putting ""particular emphasis on investing further in the Pearl River Delta and ASEAN region"". Hong Kong's Monetary Authority (HKMA) said it respected HSBC's decision. ""The HKMA appreciates that for a large international bank such as HSBC, relocation of domicile is a very major and complicated undertaking,"" said Norman Chan, its chief executive. The Treasury welcomed the move. ""It's a vote of confidence in the government's economic plan, and a boost to our goal of making the UK a great place to do more business with China and the rest of Asia,"" a spokesperson said. The CBI business lobby group also said the announcement was ""good news"" because strong banks were ""critical for the British economy"". That sentiment was echoed by the BBA, the banking industry body and TheCityUK. Share price fall In line with other banks, HSBC shares have fallen sharply this year. The stock is down 18% since the start of the year and more than 30% from last April, when the review into where to base its HQ was first announced.

"They include Jeffrey Lichtman and Marc Fernich, best known for their successful defence of the son of New York mafia boss John Gotti.

Guzman, 60, escaped twice from prison in Mexico, once in a laundry basket and later through a tunnel in a prison cell. He was extradited to the US in January and is being held in a maximum security prison in New York. Mr Lichtman confirmed in an email on Tuesday that Guzman had hired him along with Mr Fernich, William Purpura and Eduardo Balarezo.

"Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, collapsed and died while jogging near his home in Weybridge, Surrey, in November 2012. A pre-inquest hearing had been told Mr Perepilichnyy, who had been investigating a money-laundering operation, might have been poisoned. But Det Supt Ian Pollard said extensive tests had failed to find any evidence. He told the inquest at the Old Bailey the original post-mortem examination found no signs of ""third-party involvement or foul play"" and a second failed to identify the cause of death. Toxicology tests The Surrey Police detective said: ""It's not uncommon. Sometimes you don't [discover the cause of death], particularly when there was absolutely no evidence of third-party restraint, assault, attack, hypodermic injection or alien bodies found."" Plant toxicology tests at London's Kew Gardens also drew a blank, he said. On Thursday, the inquest heard that Mr Perepilichnyy, a commodity dealer and trader, had applied for £8.5m of life insurance policies a few months before he died. Lead insurer Russ Whitworth had said one company's lawyers had advanced ""florid theories"", including the possibility that a poisonous vegetable had been slipped into a soup prepared by his wife. 'Tired and exhausted' But Det Supt Pollard said: ""The conclusion of all of those tests was there was no evidence he had been poisoned. That, along with my other inquiries, led me to my conclusion that he has not been murdered."" A neighbour of Mr Perepilichnyy, a father of two, told the hearing that he had seen a ""very tired, exhausted"" middle-aged man running up a steep hill close to the gated complex where they both lived.

"Non-food sales rose by just 0.2% in the year to October, the weakest growth since the BRC began measuring the category in January 2011. The retail body said the figures would give retailers ""cause for concern"" in the run up to Christmas. Clothing sales were ""particularly hard hit"", it said. Total retail sales, including food, rose just 0.2% last month, compared with 2.4% last year. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes new store openings, sales were down 1%. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said ""consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops"". The figures - which were compiled with accountancy firm KPMG - come just seven weeks before Christmas, the key trading period for most retailers. Ms Dickinson said that the rise in inflation, which hit its highest for more than five years in September, was making shoppers ""ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford"". Lagging profits Several clothing chains have been struggling as the High Street faces tough competition from online retailers such as Asos. On Tuesday, fashion chain New Look reported a loss of £10.4m for the six months to 23 September, a marked reversal from the profit of £59.3m seen in the same period last year. UK like-for-like sales at the retailer fell 8.4%. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent It's been a pretty dismal month for non-food retailers, especially fashion. The warm weather won't have helped, but even so, these figures will be a concern as the all-important Christmas trading gets into gear. With prices rising faster than wages, consumers have less money to spend on non-essential items. Retailers are also grappling with the effects of a weaker pound as well as other cost pressures. That's on top of all the structural challenges, with the continuing shift to online. It's clear that the going's really challenging right now for a number of retailers. Next has already warned of ""extremely volatile"" trading. The first real clue on how Christmas is shaping up will be Black Friday at the end of this month. Are shoppers merely holding back for a splurge and will some retailers now be forced to join the fray in order to shift stock at a discount to generate much-needed sales? ""The results reflect another tough period of trading for the company amid a challenging retail environment on the UK High Street,"" said New Look executive chairman Alistair McGeorge, adding that ""the retailer is not anticipating a reversal in fortunes overnight."" Last week, Next reported that sales at its High Street stores had fallen by 7.7% in the year to 29 October, noting that ""sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather"". 'Reversal of fortunes' Paul Martin, head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said that October marked a ""reversal of fortunes for retailers"". He said: ""After a brief uptick, fashion sales reverted back to the dreary theme we have seen for a number of months this year. Unseasonably warm weather last month will not have helped, but this is unlikely to be the only reason the new ranges are proving unpopular."" Mr Martin said that retailers will be hoping that consumers are saving up for Black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza in the US which has become a key date for retailers in the UK. This year it falls on 24 November, two days after the Budget. Ms Dickinson said that the Chancellor Philip Hammond should reflect on the ""disappointing state of play"" when he gives his speech on 22 November and ""deliver a Budget that allays the risks of a further slowdown in consumer spending, by keeping down the cost of living. In other words, a shoppers' Budget.""","Sales of non-food items grew at the slowest pace since records began as families chose days out over shopping, the British Retail Consortium has said."
"Below are some of the biggest takeaways from the BBC's exclusive interview. UK-US RELATIONS At the beginning of his presidency, there was talk that the much-vaunted ""special relationship"" between the US and UK had grown cold. But almost eight years later, the loving feeling has certainly returned (if in fact it ever left), with Mr Obama praising the ""outstanding partner"" he has in UK Prime Minister David Cameron. He was insistent the UK had a vital role to play in both the European Union and the fight to stabilise Syria. AFRICA ""We have heard that in the US they have allowed gay relations and other dirty things."" So says William Ruto, the deputy president in Kenya - hardly the kind of talk that would fly in the US, where the right to marriage was recently extended to gay Americans across the country. But Obama says he has no tolerance for intolerance, and will push a more inclusive agenda on his trip. IRAN Mr Obama scored a victory when the US struck a nuclear deal with Iran, but finding neutral ground with Tehran might have been the easy part. Now he has to get Republicans in Congress on board with the plan. His critics say lifting sanctions will result in more money flowing to Hezbollah and the Assad regime, further destabilising the region. But Mr Obama says Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has incentive to modernise the economy. GUN LAWS The tail-end of Mr Obama's presidency has brought a looser, more candid commander-in-chief. Witness his last press conference, where he virtually dared reporters to ask him tough questions about the Iran deal. With the BBC, he openly discussed the biggest frustration of his presidency - his inability to pass any gun control reform. RACE RELATIONS When Mr Obama sang Amazing Grace on a stage full of black ministers at the funeral for one of the victims of the Charleston shootings, jokes flew on Twitter that he had achieved a ""peak black"" moment. It was a long time coming for many who hoped to see Mr Obama more fully engage with issues of racism during his presidency. But with little over a year left in office, he has been more assertive about dealing with race relations - and says the country has evolved on race since he moved into the White House.","President Barack Obama sat down with the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel, to discuss Britain's role in the world, his upcoming trip to Africa, and Mr Obama's plans for his remaining time in the White House."
"Governor Phil Bryant signed HB1523 into law on Tuesday amid opposition from equal rights groups and businesses. He said the bill ""protects sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions"". Protesters say the bill would allow for lawful discrimination of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. The bill comes at a time when numerous US states are passing or considering similar laws. North Carolina recently passed a bill that revokes protections for LGBT people and requires transgender individuals to use restrooms based on their biological gender identity. Major companies and CEOs signed on to a letter urging North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to repeal the law. Tech company PayPal has withdrawn its plan to open an operations centre, which would have employed 400 people, over the law. The governor of Georgia rejected a similar bill after pressure from major companies that do business in the state. States have been drawing up religious freedom laws, largely under pressure from religious groups, in response to the US Supreme Court ruling last summer legalising gay marriage. The intention of the Mississippi bill, the ""Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,"" is to protect people who think marriage is between one man and one woman, that sexual relations should only happen in marriages and that gender is not changeable. Mr Bryant, defending himself on Twitter after signing the bill, said the bill does not limit rights of citizens under the US Constitution and was designed to ""prevent government interference in the lives of the people"". Churches, religious charities and private business can use the law to legally not serve people whose lifestyles they disagree with. Governments must still provide services, but individual government employees can use the law to opt out. The bill also ensures that anyone who wishes to establish ""sex-specific standards"" for restrooms and dressing rooms is free to do so. ""This bill flies in the face of the basic American principles of fairness, justice and equality and will not protect anyone's religious liberty,"" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement following the bill's passage. ""Far from protecting anyone from 'government discrimination' as the bill claims, it is an attack on the citizens of our state, and it will serve as the Magnolia State's badge of shame.""",The governor of Mississippi has signed a controversial bill that allows businesses to refuse service to gay couples based on religious beliefs.
"PC Joseph Harrington, 29, from Walthamstow, told Southwark Crown Court he restrained the boy - who was then 15 - only after he became aggressive. He said he thought the teenager had a history of making false allegations. The officer denies an assault charge of stamping on the arrested boy, leaving him struggling to breathe. He said the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left him ""in fear"" for his safety during a heated confrontation in a caged cell at Forest Gate police station. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: ""Are you trying, in any way you can, to smear (him)?"" ""No sir,"" Mr Harrington replied. 'Sticking to training' The teenager has previously told the court how Mr Harrington stamped on him then ""dropped his whole body"" onto his back after apparently recognising him from a confrontation a day or two before. On that occasion, the boy claims Mr Harrington put his hands round his neck. The officer told jurors he had not used unnecessary force. ""I was sticking to my training and what my experience told me I needed to do,"" he said. He told the court that although officers had endured a ""very tiring"" few days during the riots, when police were subjected to days of abuse, he had not reacted as if he ""had had enough"".

"David Price was director of engineering at the aircraft's operators at the time of the crash at the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow on 29 November, 2013. The fatal accident inquiry heard he believed a risk of human error over low fuel warnings could have been removed. But he said it was not a ""perfect solution"". Pilot David Traill died in the crash along with helicopter crew members Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis and pub customers Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, John McGarrigle, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker. The court, which is sitting at Hampden Park, heard Mr Price worked for the helicopter's operator Bond Air Services, which is now owned by Babcock, and moved to become head of maintenance and engineering at Babcock in April 2014. 'Trigger power supply' Peter Gray, representing Babock, asked Mr Price: ""Do you have any thoughts from an engineering perspective how the risk of human error can be removed when red low fuel warnings come on?"" Mr Price replied he believed it was possible to ""effectively wire or trigger a power supply"" to automatically keep the forward transfer pump on after a low fuel warning. Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull asked if there was the possibility this would fail, to which Mr Price said: ""I accept it could... it's not a perfect solution."" Mr Gray asked if it was better than what was in place at the moment. Mr Price said: ""Had it been in place for this accident, I suggest it would have prevented it."" Roddy Dunlop QC, representing manufacturers Airbus, further probed the engineer on the issue. He said: ""What if the pump was blocked? What if you need to turn the pumps off because in some situations turning them on is dangerous? ""If one had a situation where the pump was automatically on it would only create more problems, would it not?"" Mr Price said: ""Not if it was protected."" When Mr Dunlop told him he was ""advocating a system to this inquiry"", Mr Price replied: ""I'm not a human factors expert."" The inquiry, before Sheriff principal Craig Turnbull, continues.

"Stephen Franklin, 54, from Birmingham, became ill in March after volunteering to look after key workers' children at a school. Since recovering, he has donated blood plasma, containing antibodies, five times to a national trial. The team thanked him, saying every donation was ""incredibly valuable"". NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), which is running the project, hopes by giving some of the most seriously ill patients the antibodies used to fight Covid-19 it will give their immune systems a boost. Mr Franklin said he responded to an online appeal for donors who have survived coronavirus, because he wanted to ""help people get better"" and ""give something back"". ""My own illness came on in the blink of an eye,"" Mr Franklin said. The former army helicopter co-pilot and retired firefighter, who lives in the Hall Green area, said he was ill for 10 days as his temperature soared to almost 40C. ""I felt really weird - light-headed and my lips started tingling - and I started to cough,"" he said. NHSBT also plans to freeze donations so it is readily available, ""should there be a rise in infections"" in future. So far, about 150 people have received transfusions and more than 90,000 people have volunteered to donate their plasma in England since the coronavirus outbreak.

"The two countries are clashing over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, which is officially part of Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians. The current fighting is the worst seen in decades, and both sides have blamed each other for the violence. Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over the region in 1988-94 and eventually declared a ceasefire. But they have never reached a settlement over the dispute. This image, released by the Armenian Defence Ministry, shows one of the country's gunners during renewed clashes earlier this week. Both sides have deployed heavy artillery fire, and some homes and buildings have been destroyed in civilian areas. Here, residents of Nagorno-Karabakh are served food after they fled to an Armenian border town. Azerbaijani forces shelled Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert. Heavy casualties were reported in the city, which was left without electricity according to the Armenpress news agency. This woman is seen outside her home there. Meanwhile, Nagorno-Karabakh's authorities said they had shelled a military airport in Azerbaijan's second-largest city, Ganja. Firefighters were deployed to Ganja and other towns and villages to put out fires. There are fears that the actual death toll among the militaries from all sides as well as civilians could be much higher, as casualty claims have not been independently verified. This woman was admitted to hospital in Ganja earlier this week. Azerbaijan's military says its forces have retaken control of several villages, while Nagorno-Karabakh says its troops have ""improved"" their frontline positions. The use of heavy artillery has left scars on the city streets, such as here in Stepanakert. And this building in Ganja was severely damaged be shellfire. The Azerbaijani government has said ""civilian infrastructure and ancient historical buildings were harmed"" in recent fighting. Homes have been destroyed, damaged and left empty on both sides of the conflict. Personal items have been pictured strewn amongst the debris.

"Deyan Deyanov was reported to be visiting relatives when he was detained for his own safety at Glan Clwyd Hospital's Ablett Unit, Denbighshire. Last week, Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, was murdered in Los Cristianos. Health officials in north Wales said they had had no contact with Mr Deyanov since October 2010. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which manages the hospital, said: ""The health board can confirm that it provided assistance to North Wales Police in relation to a person detained for his own safety in the summer of 2010. ""The health board has had no further contact with this client since October last year."" It is being reported that Mr Deyanov, 28, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Health officials have given few details, citing patient confidentiality as the reason. The statement said: ""We are currently reviewing all records relating to the case in line with standard clinical procedures. ""We will be co-operating with other statutory agencies but have a duty to protect patient confidentiality and will therefore not be making further statements regarding the case at this time."" It is not clear if he was allowed to leave the psychiatric unit after being assessed as safe, or if he absconded. The Sun reported that Mr Deyanov, 28, a Bulgarian national, was sectioned during a visit to see relatives in the UK and quoted two of his ex-girlfriends claiming he was a heavy drug user. North Wales Police would not comment but denied one newspaper report that it had built up a profile of Mr Deyanov and his time in the UK. Mrs Mills-Westley, originally from Norwich, Norfolk, was inside a supermarket, which sells Chinese food and tourist souvenirs, on Avenida Juan Carlos when she was stabbed and decapitated. The grandmother of five had been living in Tenerife after retiring from her job as a road safety officer with Norfolk County Council. Reports from Tenerife suggest Mr Deyanov had previously received psychiatric treatment on the island. A search and arrest order was issued for Mr Deyanov on 10 May, just three days before the killing. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford said a magistrate had ordered his arrest in connection with a violent attack. Mr Deyanov was arrested on suspicion of murder and is now being held at a psychiatric unit in Tenerife.","The man accused of beheading a British grandmother in Tenerife had been treated in a psychiatric unit in north Wales, it has emerged."
"Lord Monson said the Alexander Monson Foundation would campaign against police brutality and aid human rights. His son, Alexander, heir to the Burton estate in Lincolnshire, died in May in Diani after he was arrested on suspicion of smoking cannabis. An independent pathologist suggested he died from a head injury. Kenyan police said he died from a drugs overdose. The foundation was launched following a private memorial service in Kensington, attended by about 600 people. Speaking at the event, Lord Monson said he was convinced the Kenyan police had a part to play in his son's death, despite their denial. An investigation by the Kenyan authorities ruled out police involvement. He said: ""So many people are empathising and expressing their genuine sorrow and anger about what has happened."" He added the family were determined to get justice for their son. Lord Monson said the post-mortem examination found his son had died from blunt force trauma to his head. He hopes the foundation will ""accelerate the process of police reform"".",An aristocrat whose son died in police custody in Kenya has started a foundation in his name.
"An additional 700,000 UK children and pensioners have fallen into relative poverty - households with less than 60% the median income - over the past four years. The charity said it was the first time in 20 years that poverty in these groups had seen sustained rises. Ministers say their support is helping pensioners and families out of poverty. What does the report say? According to the JRF report, since 2013 an extra 300,000 pensioners and 400,000 children are now living in poverty and the ""prospects for solving"" the problem ""currently look worrying"". ""It is a real struggle for thousands and thousands of people every day to make ends meets,"" Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, told Radio 4's Today programme. Despite the government protecting the value of the basic state pension since 2010, the foundation says Pension Credit, a benefit paid to the poorest pensioners, has not kept pace with rising costs. Researchers say the rise in child poverty has been driven by stagnant wages for low income families and a freeze on benefits and changes to tax credits, which many families, both in and out of work, rely on. 'I go without' Karla McDonagh describes herself as ""on the bread line"". The 31-year-old from Cheshire is a single mother to son, Cameron. ""I go without as long as he's eating and happy,"" she said. This can mean not having things like milk, sugar or butter. ""Sometimes it can be three days before I can afford to make something decent for tea. ""It's quite stressful. I have to sit back and reflect and think of options to make things better, re-budget my money - sometimes not pay my TV licence, just so I can go out and pay £25 on food at the end of the month. But I always get through it,"" she said. For Flo Singleton, she struggles to get by with her pension from a part-time job. ""I have worked, I have not scrounged all my life,"" she said. ""[But it has been] part-time only, because you have to fit it around the kids, don't you?"" She has resorted to spending time travelling on buses to keep warm, rather than turning on the heating at home. Ms Singleton added: ""It's heat or eat isn't it? If you go out, you don't have to have your heating on, do you? If you go on the buses, it doesn't cost you."" 'A warning sign' The charity says ending the benefits freeze is the single biggest change the government could do to help the 14m people - 4m children and 1.9m pensioners - now living in poverty. New threats to the poorest households include rising housing costs, higher food and energy bills, debts and not being able to contribute to a pension, said the foundation. The latest figures represent a ""real warning sign that our hard-fought progress is in peril,"" Mr Robb added. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said the figures were ""totally unacceptable"" and ""a truly terrifying prospect for millions trying to make ends meet"". A government spokesman said since 2010, the number of people in absolute poverty - an assessment of basic living needs which takes into account a household's access to services as well as income - had fallen by more than 500,000. He said: ""We are spending an extra £4.2bn on pensioners, carers and disabled people next year, and continue to spend around £90bn a year supporting people of working age, including those who are out of work or on a low income."" What is relative poverty? The report's reference to relative poverty means that a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs. For couples with no children, this is an income anything less than £248 a week. For a single person with no children, it is anything less than £144. For a couple with two children, aged five and 14, an income of less than £401 a week is considered relative poverty, whilst a single parent with children of the same age would be in poverty if they had less than £297 per week.","Thousands of people are struggling to make ends meet in the UK every day, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said."
"They said if Russia took such a step they would ""take further action, individually and collectively"". The G7 leaders also said they would not recognise the results of a referendum in Crimea this weekend on whether to split from Ukraine and join Russia. Separately, the US president said they ""will be forced to apply costs"" if Russia does not change course. Barack Obama was speaking after holding talks with Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Washington. Mr Yatsenyuk told reporters Ukraine ""is and will be part of the Western world"". Earlier, Ukraine's national security chief Andriy Parubiy warned of a major Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders. He said Russian troops had not withdrawn since carrying out military exercises near Ukraine's eastern and southern frontiers last month, and were now ""only two to three hours"" from Kiev. 'Deeply flawed' The Group of Seven industrial nations - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - along with the European Union urged Russia to ""cease all efforts to change the status of Crimea"". ""In addition to its impact on the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states,"" they said in a statement released by the White House. They said Sunday's referendum, asking the people of Crimea if they want to be a part of Russia or Ukraine, has ""no legal effect"" as it is in ""direct violation"" of Ukraine's constitution. ""Given the lack of adequate preparation and the intimidating presence of Russian troops, it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force,"" they added. The G7 leaders repeated their calls for Russia to de-escalate the crisis by withdrawing its troops, talking directly with Kiev and using international mediators to ""address any legitimate concerns it may have"". European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he hoped EU countries would keep their ""very united and firm position because we don't want to see, one century after the First World War, exactly the same kind of behaviour of countries annexing other countries"". Polish PM Donald Tusk said it may be time for the EU ""to consider the possibility of having second phase sanctions"" against Russia. At a joint news conference with Mr Tusk, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated the EU could sign the ""political part"" of a long-awaited agreement on closer ties with Ukraine later this month. 'Subversive agents' But diplomatic efforts with Russia continue. US Secretary of State John Kerry said he will travel to London for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday, and present him ""with a series of options"" for resolving the crisis. France's President Francois Hollande has spoken by telephone to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and both agreed to ""continue the discussion"" on resolving the crisis. Russian troops and pro-Russian gunmen moved in to seize key sites in Crimea - an autonomous region with a majority of ethnic Russians - after the fall of Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych last month. Andriy Parubiy said Russian troops had been seen massing on Ukraine's eastern and southern borders where he said there was a ""critical situation"". He accused Moscow of sending ""subversive agents"" into those areas to try to create a pre-text to deploy troops in the same way it has done in Crimea. Mr Parubiy said Kiev's parliament will vote on Thursday to establish a National Guard of 20,000 people - recruited from activists involved in the recent pro-Western protests as well as from military academies - to strengthen Ukraine's defences. The National Guard, he said, would be deployed to ""protect state borders, general security and prevent ""terrorist activities"". President Yanukovych was forced from office after violence broke out between police and protesters in Kiev, in which more than 90 people were killed. The protesters had taken over Kiev's Independence Square, calling for the government's resignation, after Mr Yanukovych rejected a deal with the EU in favour of a bail-out from Russia.","Leaders of the G7 group of nations have called on Russia to stop all efforts to ""annex"" Ukraine's Crimea region."
"Jake Molloy, from the RMT union, said a ""demoralised"" workforce was facing constant attacks on their terms and conditions. Speaking at the STUC conference in Dundee, Mr Molloy said the same thing had happened in 1986. The Piper Alpha platform exploded in July 1988, killing 167 men. The STUC backed a series of motions calling for urgent government intervention to ""alleviate the pressures on employers and jobs across the UK Continental Shelf, ensuring occupational health and safety standards and collective agreements are protected and strengthened, and industry impositions are ended"". 'Demoralised workforce' The conference also noted ""the backlog of safety critical maintenance work has grown significantly since summer 2014"". Mr Molloy, regional organiser of the RMT's offshore energy branch, said: ""Everything that we are seeing in the offshore sector today was played out in 1986 - everything. ""In just two short summers, in 1988, the Piper Alpha blew apart and took 167 men. We cannot and must not allow this industry to make the same mistakes again. ""Casualisation, long hours and a demoralised workforce living under constant threat of attacks to their terms and conditions and the ever-present threat of redundancy. ""It wasn't the way to run an industry in 1986 and it took the deaths of 167 men to prove that.""","The oil industry is in danger of making the same mistakes it did in the years before the Piper Alpha disaster, an offshore union boss has warned."
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley They cite the success of the Stuxnet worm in attacking industrial control systems as a prime example of what to expect in 2011. Other predictions include a rise in sophisticated malware, Wikileaks-style breaches and a focus on mobile. But Stuxnet type attacks top the list of forthcoming fears after the success it had interfering with Iran's nuclear power generation efforts. In November, Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad confirmed that Stuxnet had hit its target. ""They succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts,"" Mr Ahmadinejad told a news conference. 'Destruction' Researchers who have studied Stuxnet say its complexity suggests it could only have been written by a ""nation state"" in the West, rather than an organised crime group. Security firm Kaspersky described Stuxnet as ""a working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that will lead to the creation of a new arms race"". Art Coviello, president of security firm RSA, agreed with Kaspersky's assessment. ""Stuxnet is the most troubling risk to me when I think about the conflict of cyber warfare,"" he said. ""I also realise all civilised nations of the world recognise that cyber warfare will escalate to the point of mutually assured destruction,"" he said. ""I would hope we all recognise that but I worry about [Stuxnet] getting in to the hands of non-state actors,"" Mr Coviello told BBC News. Some experts believe that not only will there be more incidents in 2011 involving Stuxnet but there will be attempts to improve it. ""I would love to say that Stuxnet is something that is unique but I don't think that is going to be the case,"" said Jason Urso, chief technology officer for Honeywell and an expert in the security of manufacturing and industrial plants. ""The publicity surrounding Stuxnet will bring awareness to the fact that these critical infrastructures like power plants, oil refineries and so on are using systems that can be vulnerable if not secured in the right way,"" he said. ""I think there is a real concern for copy-cat style attacks."" Hacks and attacks Sharing the headlines with Stuxnet were the hack attacks carried out by supporters of whistle-blowing website Wikileaks. In late 2010, Wikileaks began releasing some of a cache of 250,000 leaked US diplomatic cables. Members of a group calling themselves Anonymous attacked Amazon, Mastercard, Visa and PayPal in retaliation for those firms hampering Wikileaks' ability to raise funds. The attacks took the form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These involve bombarding a website with data to the point that it is overwhelmed. Dr Hugh Thompson, a professor of computer science at Columbia University, said these events have changed security for the long term. ""Now we have people who are viewing these types of attacks under the lens of activism and that is a dangerous sort of thing to do when talking about companies,"" he said. ""It will change some of the elements of enterprise security which has previously centred around worrying about firewalls and data leaks,"" said Dr Thompson. ""Now, if companies fall out of favour for whatever reason, like BP over the oil spill, there is now this other route where people can protest in the future. ""That is scary from an enterprise security perspective,"" he said. Net security expert Dan Kaminsky said DDoS attacks were likely to proliferate in 2011 because of their simplicity. ""There is very little technological skill involved in creating a denial of service attack,"" he said. ""They will never go away and the barrier to entry is very low yet their effectiveness is perceived as high and that means we will see more and more of them."" Art Gilliland, a vice president at security giant Symantec, said the Wikileaks debacle underscored the need to shift the focus from securing infrastructure to securing content. ""The level of professionalism in the hacker community is driven by the fact they are going after corporate information whether its credit card details or intellectual property or embarrassing documents. ""If they are able to sell it, like any market it creates a specialisation in the market and tools to make the hacker community more sophisticated - whether it's for financial gain or some sort of government nation state priority."" Mr Gilliland said that while DDoS attacks would not go away, the real hackers or criminals will keep their eyes fixed on the financials. ""There is some press value in taking down a website but not a lot of money and that is where the level of investment will go - stealing information because there is money there,"" he said. ""The big pain will come from stealing that content or information and holding that party or organisation or government entity to ransom."" Future targets Another top target in 2011 is likely to mobile phones, which are increasingly being turned into virtual wallets and being used in the workplace. The M86 Security Labs predicted in its threat report for 2011 that the ""exploding smartphone market and growing tablet demand will lead to more mobile malware"". Mr Coviello from RSA does not disagree but is more sanguine about the scale of a problem. ""For me mobile is just another end point,"" he said. ""Okay, it's a different end point and there will be new viruses developed to attack it and new pieces of malware but they are the same kinds of things used to attack physical end points today like PC's and the internet as a whole. ""Mobile devices do mean more transactions, more flow of information and the law of averages is that there will be more security problems but they have to be taken in context."" From Symantec, Mr Gilliland agreed. ""It is clear you will see more attacks in this landscape because people are doing more of their lives on these devices but with the proliferation of operating systems there is no one clear target. ""If there starts to become a ""winner"" in that platform it will become a more attractive target,"" he said. ""For example, if you look at the demographics of who buys the iPhone or iPad, they are usually technically savvy, typically wealthier and therefore maybe that is a richer target landscape.""","The biggest security concerns for the coming year will be cyber-sabotage and cyber-espionage, say industry experts."
"Elizabeth Aruoriwo Obueza, 48, was detained two weeks ago after the government dismissed her appeal to stay in Japan for protection against religious persecution. But a rights group says she is being held on her own because she is an activist for asylum seekers. Japan rejected 99% of asylum requests last year, accepting just 27 refugees. The Nigerian, an evangelical Christian, says she fled from Nigeria to Japan in 1991 to escape female genital mutilation and applied for asylum in 2011. Her arrest comes as the justice ministry is trying to reduce the number of foreigners living in Japan without visas, currently about 60,000. But her lawyer told the BBC she was being particularly targeted by the authorities because she petitioned the Japanese government for better conditions for asylum seekers. How bad is solitary confinement? What's it like to spend decades in solitary confinement? How solitary broke a man named Badness Ms Obueza says she has spent 22 hours a day alone in a small cell since being detained. ""Elizabeth is held in solitary because she's an activist and immigration officials don't want her causing trouble,"" said Mitsuru Miyasako, head of the Provisional Release Association in Japan, a group representing refugees and immigrants. ""Locking someone up alone in a tiny room is to ruin them psychologically."" The Japanese authorities did not comment. Ms Obueza had campaigned for asylum seekers and people on ""provisional release"", a status that allows migrants to live outside a detention facility but barring them from working or travelling freely. People on provisional release are being specifically targeted by the authorities, activists and lawyers say. She has also spent the last 10 years helping asylum seekers navigate the immigration system and has previously been detained for 10 months. ""I want to help people. Give me the right to help people - don't put me in here,"" Ms Obueza told Reuters news agency. The crackdown on asylum seekers comes as Japan faces a impending labour shortage due to its the ageing population.",A Nigerian asylum seeker says she is being held in solitary confinement in Tokyo after her claim was denied.
"A California court awarded Apple $1.05bn (£652m) in damages, after ruling several of its software and design technologies had been infringed. Samsung has also alleged that several of the judge's decisions were ""unfair"". Apple is seeking to increase the size of the award by about $700m. The South Korean firm's accusations were made in paperwork filed on 21 September that had been sealed until now. Work history Samsung said foreman Velvin Hogan had provided an incomplete answer during jury selection. It said he had revealed he had been involved in a single previous lawsuit, but had failed to disclose two others. It noted that Mr Hogan had been sued by his former employer - hard disk maker Seagate - for breach of contract, and had subsequently filed for personal bankruptcy. Samsung's filing highlights that it is the biggest direct shareholder in Seagate, following a $1.4bn deal in 2011. ""Mr Hogan's failure to disclose the Seagate suit raises issues of bias that Samsung should have been allowed to explore in questioning,"" its lawyers wrote. Mr Hogan did mention that he had worked for Seagate in court. When questioned about the issue by Reuters, he added that he had never been asked to list every lawsuit he had been involved in. 'Sending a message' The filing goes on to suggest Mr Hogan had overstepped the mark during the jury's deliberations. It said several pieces of advice he had given had been ""incorrect and extraneous legal standards [that] had no place in the jury room"". In addition the Galaxy-device maker took issue with post-verdict interviews Mr Hogan gave, in which he said he wanted ""to send a message to the industry at large that patent infringing is not the right thing to do"" and ""make sure the message we sent was not just a slap on the wrist"". It highlighted the fact Mr Hogan had previously remained silent when asked if he had had strong feelings about intellectual property laws. When the BBC questioned Mr Hogan about his comments, in August, he acknowledged that jurors had wanted to ""send a message"" to discourage wilful patent infringement, but added ""it wasn't necessarily focused at Samsung - that is where it had been taken out of context"". Courtroom limitations Samsung also alleges that a new trial should be granted because the time, witness and exhibit restrictions imposed by Judge Lucy Koh were unfair. ""The constraints... were unprecedented for a patent case of this complexity and magnitude, and prevented Samsung from presenting a full and fair case in response to Apple's many claims,"" its lawyer wrote. Judge Koh also imposed limits on Apple during the case, notably rebuffing its lawyer's attempt to submit a long list of potential rebuttal witnesses saying: ""Unless you're smoking crack, you know these witnesses aren't going to be called."" Apple declined to comment on Samsung's filing. Its lawyers have called on the judge to increase damages to about $1.75bn on the grounds that the jury found Samsung's infringements of its patents to have been a ""wilful"" act. It is also wants the judge to impose a sales ban on several of Samsung's handsets and tablets. Both sides' claims will be considered at a hearing on 6 December.","Samsung has called for a retrial of a recent patent dispute case, claiming the jury foreman had ""failed to answer [questions] truthfully"" and might have been biased."

"The phrase is used by the film character Borat, a fictional journalist from Kazakhstan. The first Borat film caused outrage in the country, and authorities threatened to sue creator Sacha Baron Cohen. But the country's tourism board has now embraced Borat as a perfect marketing tool - particularly as a second Borat film has just been released. It has released a number of short advertisements that highlight the country's scenery and culture. The people in the video then use Borat's catchphrase ""very nice"". ""Kazakhstan's nature is very nice. Its food is very nice. And its people, despite Borat's jokes to the contrary, are some of the nicest in the world,"" Kairat Sadvakassov, deputy chairman of Kazakh Tourism, said in a statement. The tourism board were persuaded to use the catchphrase by American Dennis Keen and his friend Yermek Utemissov. They pitched the idea and produced the advertisements, according to the New York Times. The response from social media users has been positive with many saying the advertisements capitalise on the film and send a positive message. One said: ""Well done. Great way to take the publicity created by a comedian and turn it to a positive message."" The second film itself has had a mixed reception. The Kazakh American Association has slammed the film for promoting ""racism, cultural appropriation and xenophobia"". In a letter sent to Amazon, which has distribution rights to the film, the group asked: ""Why is our small nation fair game for public ridicule?"" In Kazakhstan, more than 100,000 people signed an online petition demanding a cancellation of the film after a trailer was released. ""They completely desecrate and humiliate Kazakhstan and the dignity of the Kazakh nation,"" the petition said. Others on social media branded the film as a ""stupid American comedy"". When the first Borat film was released in 2006, authorities banned the film and release of it on DVD and people were blocked from visiting its website. Officials felt the movie portrayed Kazakhstan as a racist, sexist and primitive country. In the film Borat bragged about incest and rape. He also joked that the former Soviet nation had the cleanest prostitutes in the world. The film also caused outrage in Romania where an entire village said they were ""humiliated"" by the film. The village was used as the backdrop for Borat's house. Residents said they were told the film was going to be a documentary, but instead were portrayed as backward people and criminals. Years later, however, the Kazakhstan government thanked Sacha Baron Cohen for boosting tourism in the country. In 2012, the foreign minister at the time, Yerzhan Kazykhanov, said he was ""grateful"" to Borat for ""helping attract tourists"" to the country, adding that 10 times more people were applying for visas to go there.","Kazakhstan's tourism board has adopted the Borat catchphrase ""very nice"" in its new advertising campaign."
"They claim the privatised company deliberately issued a profit warning weeks before many were planning to sell their shares. Since the announcement on 1 October the shares have fallen by 28%. However Royal Mail said it had no choice but to tell the City as soon as it realised profits would be lower. Some 145,000 postal staff have waited five years to sell the free shares they were given at the time of privatisation. Monday is the first day they can sell their holdings without having to pay tax or National Insurance. The shares have fallen by 45% since they peaked at 632p in May this year, with some staff seeing the value of their holdings slipping by more than £2,500. The shares are now just 13p above the original flotation price of 330p. Anger Des Arthur, a postman from Coventry, was one of those who complained about the company's announcement to the City. ""The timing of it could be viewed as extremely cynical,"" he told the BBC. ""It's going to look like it's not right."" The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said hundreds more staff had expressed their anger. ""Our members certainly believe it's just been done to deflate what they would get if they sold their shares,"" said Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU. ""You know what people are like; people in some ways have already spent that money in anticipation."" 'Happy' Royal Mail said it understood the disappointment felt by its staff, but said it had no choice over when to release the profit warning. ""We had an obligation to tell the market, and that's what we did,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""There's no link between that and the free shares."" However the company said anyone who pre-elected to sell their shares before 1 October would be able to cancel their transactions. Other employees said they were happy just to have been given free shares in the first place. ""I'm not annoyed,"" said Adam Alarakhia, a postman from Leicester, whose holding is now worth around £2,700. ""The price will shoot up again in our busy period."" Should staff sell? Most brokers have Royal Mail shares down as a ""sell"" - in other words they expect the shares to fall further. Berenberg has a target price of £3. But the further they fall, the higher the percentage yield. At the moment the annual dividend is a healthy 7%. Indeed so far employees who took their full allocation will have earned £850, Royal Mail said, making up for some of their theoretical (on-paper) losses. ""Management have recently reconfirmed their commitment to growing the dividend over time, but with investment demands likely to rise, we find it difficult to see how far that can go,"" said Nicholas Hyett of Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Nonetheless, for income seeking investors Royal Mail could well be attractive."" The original privatisation of Royal Mail was criticised by the National Audit Office, which said that taxpayers had lost £1bn, because the flotation price was set too low.",Hundreds of Royal Mail staff have complained that they have been short-changed as a result of a dramatic fall in the company's share price.
"""It's going [to] be a very important meeting, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" he said. Meanwhile, new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had had a ""good conversation"" with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang recently. On Friday, Mr Kim and the South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. The inter-Korean summit at the border came just months after warlike rhetoric from the North. Mr Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. For years, Pyongyang has insisted that it would never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it claims it needs to defend itself against aggression from the US. What did President Trump say? Speaking at a rally in Washington, Michigan, he said: ""I think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks."" He said he hoped for successful negotiations on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But the president added that he was ready to walk away if the talks did not work out. North Korea has not publicly commented on Mr Trump's latest statements. Earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump tweeted that ""things are going well"" and that preparations were being made for his summit with Mr Kim. Separately, Mr Pompeo told ABC News that Mr Kim was ""prepared to... lay out a map that would help us achieve"" denuclearisation. Mr Pompeo described the North Korean leader as ""very well prepared"" during their talks in Pyongyang. US officials are still deciding where to hold the talks between President Trump and Mr Kim - but Mongolia and Singapore are understood to be two countries on the shortlist. What was agreed at the inter-Korean summit? Mr Kim and Mr Moon said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace. The commitment to denuclearisation does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities but rather to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". Catch me up The statement talks about this taking place in a phased manner, but does not include further details. Many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent enthusiasm for engagement. Previous inter-Korean agreements have been abandoned after the North resorted to nuclear and missile tests and the South elected more conservative presidents. Mr Kim said the two leaders had agreed to work to prevent a repeat of the region's ""unfortunate history"" in which progress had ""fizzled out"". Other points the leaders agreed on in a joint statement were:","US President Donald Trump has said talks with North Korea could take place ""over the next three or four weeks""."
"By Paul RubensTechnology reporter If you're David Beckham or Lily Allen you may be used to this type of VIP treatment, but if your fame is more limited, or even non-existent then you might find this attention rather disconcerting. Despite this, thanks to facial recognition software you don't need to be a celebrity for sales assistants to know your name the moment you enter a shop. That's because companies such as Japanese technology giant NEC and FaceFirst, a California-based company, offer systems that use cameras placed at the entrances to shops to identify people as they come in. If your face fits When important existing or potential customers are spotted, a text message can be sent to appropriate sales staff to ensure they provide personal attention. ""Someone could approach you and give you a cappuccino when you arrive, and then show you the things they think you will be interested in buying,"" says Joel Rosenkrantz, FaceFirst's chief executive. Before a system such as FaceFirst's can be put into operation, it has to be loaded up with photos. So an obvious question to ask is where would they come from? ""You can easily get pictures of famous people, and you could get the pictures of other potential customers from Facebook,"" he suggests. ""If a particular brand has 10,000 likes on Facebook, you could use the profile pictures of all the people who have liked it."" It would also be possible to get photographs of people who have an account on the retailer's website, if they sign in via Facebook, or simply by taking a photograph of them using their webcam or cameraphone. ""You can tell customers that if they agree to enrol [their face] with their camera, then they will be offered a discount coupon when they walk into the store, or get them to tick a box saying they agree that their picture can be used when they log on with Facebook,"" Mr Rosenkrantz says. NEC explicitly markets its system as a way ""to identify the presence of important visitors, whether expected or unannounced"" but FaceFirst's system is currently being used to recognise known shoplifters and alert security staff so they can be asked to leave. Mr Rosenkrantz says using its software this way can reduce stock shrinkage by 25% or more. Get the message Facial recognition software can also be useful to identify a customer's age and sex, even if it can't identify a specific individual. For example, Chicago-based food manufacturer Mondelez International is reportedly working on ""smart shelves"", which can show messages targeted at specific demographics when people look at the goods on display. If the system identifies a teenage girl picking up a diet soft drink, it could then display a message that the drink only contains one calorie, while for a middle-aged man it could offer a discount voucher in the form of a QR code. Tesco is planning to use similar technology in its petrol stations. So is this type of sex and age recognition effective? ""There is anecdotal evidence that the results can be quite extraordinary,"" says Tony Stockil, chief executive of retail strategy consultancy Javelin Group. As an example he cites a campaign in Germany, where a retailer in a train station targeted messages at males of a certain age group, reminding them that the next day was Valentine's Day. This resulted in a high proportion of them buying last-minute gifts. We are watching Many retailers are currently experimenting with iBeacons - Bluetooth devices that can detect and record the location of smartphones that have the retailer's app installed as the owner browses the store or simply walks by. They can then be sent a special offer or discount voucher to tempt them to make a purchase, either in the store or online. German restaurant chain Mook Group is using iBeacons in a different way entirely. The iBeacons in its Zenzakan restaurant in Frankfurt let the restaurant's smartphone app know whenever a customer visits. The more frequently a customer goes to the restaurant the higher their ""Mook status"" in the app - which can range from ""Guest"" and ""Novice"" to ""Ambitioned Gourmet"" and ""Addicted Connoisseur."" ""What we have done is use iBeacons for a little gamification of a luxury experience,"" says Joel Martinez, chief technology officer at Candylabs, the internet marketing company that designed the app. All the data about visits is only stored on the customer's phone, he adds. That means customers won't be recognised automatically when they enter the restaurant. If they want to receive the perks that their Mook status entitles them to then they have to ""self report"" by showing staff their status in the Mook app. ""Privacy is very important,"" Mr Martinez concludes. ""We don't want customers to think that the restaurant is monitoring their movements - we want to maintain their privacy.""","Imagine walking into a shop you've never been in before, to be greeted by name by a sales assistant you don't know."
"It was made by the general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) at their annual conference in Westport. John Jacob said he was prepared to go to jail for initiating strike action. Public servants faced cuts averaging 15% when the crisis erupted in 2008. The AGSI will hold a special conference to discuss possible industrial action. The association has said morale is at an all time low and 93% of members want to take work-to-rule industrial action in respect of their efforts to get their salaries restored to levels prior to the economic crash in the Irish economy. During his speech, Mr Jacob also outlined the dangers of the job and most of the officers in the hall stood up when asked had they ever been attacked on duty. The association also said the closure of 95 garda stations has damaged An Garda Síochána's relationship with the community. It said many rural communities have been left with no gardaí because they have been transferred to other areas. Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan is due to attend the conference on Tuesday.",A call has been made for Irish police officers to march on the Dáil in their uniforms if the government does not restore their pay to pre-economic crash levels.
"An unexpected increase in the number of households saying they do not watch live TV so do not pay for a licence has been blamed for the shortfall. Many cuts are to come from professional and support areas, while management structures will be streamlined. BBC director general Tony Hall says this will save around £50m a year so more cuts will come. Lord Hall said the BBC was facing ""difficult choices"" because of the tough financial climate. He said more than one million fewer people had a television set than was predicted in 2011, when a previous round of efficiency savings was implemented, so extra savings had to be found. ""Despite the progress already made, and the realities of the licence fee being frozen for seven years, a new financial challenge means additional savings must now be found,"" he said. 'Tough message' He added decision-making had become too complicated in recent times, as new services have been introduced, and that he wanted to cut these back to make things simpler, which ""inevitably would lead to fewer decision-makers"". Professional and support departments such as IT, human resources and engineering will be looked at closely to see where there is duplication, with the possibility of merging divisions across the BBC and its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. In announcing more than 1,000 jobs cuts, Lord Hall said he recognised ""this is a tough message"". He said the BBC had already made £1.5bn in savings, but because of the shortfall in licence fee income, more needs to be done. The four key areas for making the savings are: The BBC licence fee of £145.50 has been frozen for seven years, and the process of charter renewal is getting under way, which will decide how the BBC is run when its current royal charter runs out at the end of 2016. Broadcast union Bectu said while it supports the BBC's ambitions of ""simplification and standardisation"", it is opposed to any compulsory redundancies. General secretary Gerry Morrissey said: ""We welcome the aims and the commitment to cutting the layers of management between the DG and programme makers, for example. ""That said it is essential, as in any programme of cuts, that staff and unions are fully involved in the consultation and that where jobs are closed that redeployment opportunities are maximised.""","The BBC is to cut 1,000 jobs because of a £150m budget gap in its licence fee income."
"The ""pepperpot"" tower in Upton upon Severn still bears the scars of fighting during the Civil War. Simon Smith, from Malvern Hills District Council, climbed the tower with an engineer and found the jackdaw's nest. ""I clambered up as far as I dared and found a great ball of mud that is jamming up the hands,"" he said. The clock had not worked for six weeks but it was not until Tuesday that the cause of the problem was discovered. The jackdaws, which had got into the tower through the clock face, made their nest around the spindle that controls the hands. Mr Smith said the birds would be left undisturbed until their chicks had left the nest in about a month. Bullet holes He said the council would then face the challenge of stopping the jackdaws from getting into the tower again. The tower is all that is left of the medieval St Peter and St Paul Church. Before the Battle of Worcester in 1651 it was the scene of fierce fighting, as Royalist troops tried to prevent Cromwell's army crossing the River Severn. Bullet holes from the fighting can still be seen in the stonework. The tower was originally topped by a steeple but when this became unsafe in 1770 it was replaced with a cupola, which gave rise to the pepperpot nickname. The knave of the church was demolished in 1937, and in 1953 the tower was declared an ancient monument. It now houses the town's heritage centre, and the garden around it contains a memorial to Admiral William Tennant, the man who organised the Dunkirk evacuation in World War II.",A family of jackdaws has stopped the clock in a medieval church tower in Worcestershire.
"By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News Jordi Casamitjana says he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing it invested pension funds in firms involved in animal testing. He claims he was discriminated against, and the tribunal will now decide if veganism should be protected in law. The League Against Cruel Sports says he was dismissed for gross misconduct. It denies the sacking was because of his veganism. Mr Casamitjana says he is an ""ethical"" vegan. ""Some people only eat a vegan diet but they don't care about the environment or the animals, they only care about their health,"" he told the BBC. ""I care about the animals and the environment and my health and everything. ""That's why I use this term 'ethical veganism' because for me veganism is a belief and affects every single aspect of my life."" Plant-based Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet. However, ethical vegans try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation, for instance avoiding wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing. They may refer to ""companion animals"" rather than ""pets"", and will avoid zoos or other environments where they consider animals are exploited. Mr Casamitjana worked for the animal welfare charity the League Against Cruel Sports and claims that, to his surprise, he discovered it was investing its pension funds in companies that carried out animal testing. He says he drew this to the attention of his managers. When nothing changed, he informed other employees and was sacked as a result. He is now bringing a legal case, claiming he was discriminated against on the basis of his vegan belief. 'Factually wrong' In a statement, the League Against Cruel Sports said: ""Mr Casamitjana was dismissed from his position because of gross misconduct. ""To link his dismissal with issues pertaining to veganism is factually wrong. ""Mr Casamitjana is seeking to use his veganism as the reason for his dismissal. We emphatically reject this claim."" However, in a hearing next March, an employment tribunal will, for the first time, determine whether veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" protected by law. If the tribunal decides that it is, the discrimination claim will proceed to a full trial. ""Religion or belief"" is one of nine ""protected characteristics"" covered by the Equality Act 2010. The others, all ranked equally, are: It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate directly, by treating an employee less favourably than others because of their religion or belief. Harassment and victimisation on grounds of religion or belief are also unlawful, as is indirect discrimination, by applying a criterion or practice that disadvantages employees of a particular religion or belief unless there is an objective justification. To qualify as a philosophical belief, veganism must: If Mr Casamitjana succeeds in his hearing, the consequences for vegans could be life-changing. His solicitor, Peter Daly, of Bindmans LLP, said: ""If we are successful, we will achieve a judgment which formally recognises the protected status of ethical veganism and which could then be used as the basis to combat discrimination against vegans in employment, in the provision of goods and services, and in education. ""This is therefore a landmark case."" But Nick Spencer, from the think tank Theos, which stimulates debate about religion in society, warns of dangers in unrestricted recognition and legal protection of people's beliefs. ""The irony in all this is that rights are intended to be liberating but if we're all turned into rights bearers, my rights clashing with your rights, we end up having to appeal to the courts to sort out our differences and that can become oppressive for everybody,"" he said. Figures from the Vegan Society, which supports Mr Casamitjana, suggest veganism is on the rise. The society says there are currently 600,000 vegans in Britain, up from about 150,000 in 2014. It bases its estimate on surveys from the Food Standards Agency, Ipsos Mori and the National Centre for Social Science Research. ""For many people, veganism is a deeply held belief,"" says Louise Davies, Vegan Society head of campaigns, policy and research. ""This could be a landmark ruling that will not only recognise the validity and importance of veganism but also confirm that the needs of vegans in their employment and their everyday lives must be taken seriously."" Mr Casamitjana says he has been discriminated against many times because of his vegan beliefs. He said: ""It is important for all the vegans to know that if they want to talk about veganism, they are protected and no-one will say 'Shut up'. ""It is important that the law protects vegans.""","A tribunal is to be asked to decide whether veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" akin to a religion, in a landmark legal action."

"Tini Owens, 66, has asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a family court ruling, which said she couldn't divorce her husband Hugh Owens, 78. The court heard her case was that the marriage had broken down, but Mr Owens disagreed and said the couple still had a ""few years"" to enjoy. A ruling is yet to be published. 'Extraordinarily unusual' Judge Robin Tolson ruled against Mrs Owens in the family court last year, concluding that her allegations were ""of the kind to be expected in marriage"" and refused to grant a divorce petition. Three appeal judges, led by Sir James Munby, the most senior family court judge in England and Wales, analysed the case at a hearing in London on Tuesday. Philip Marshall QC, representing Mrs Owens, told the court that the ""vast majority"" of divorces were undefended in 21st Century England. He said: ""It is extraordinarily unusual in modern times for a court to dismiss a petition for divorce."" The court was told the couple had married in 1978 and lived in Broadway, Worcester. Mr Marshall said Judge Tolson had failed to make ""proper findings of fact"" and argued that his ruling should be overturned. Mrs Owens had made 27 allegations about the way Mr Owens treated her, including that he was ""insensitive"" in his ""manner and tone"" and said she was ""constantly mistrusted"" and felt unloved. ""The simple fact is that I have been desperately unhappy in our marriage for many years,"" she said in a witness statement. ""There is no prospect of reconciliation."" Mr Owens, a retired businessman, disagreed and denied allegations made against him. Mr Marshall said judges had to consider the ""cumulative effect"" of what might be classed as a long list of trivial matters. ""It was my client's complaint that her husband treated her in a childlike way,"" Mr Marshall told judges. ""And in a way which was effectively that she should agree with his will."" Barrister Nigel Dyer QC, who represented Mr Owens, said appeal judges should not overturn Judge Tolson's ruling. He said: ""At the moment, as the law stands, unhappiness, discontent, disillusionment are not facts which a petitioner can rely upon as facts which prove irretrievable breakdown."" Judges were told that Mrs Owens had an affair which lasted less than a year and the court heard the couple, who have grown-up children, slept in different rooms. Sir James said the judges would examine legislation laid down by Parliament and told lawyers: ""It is not a ground for divorce if you find yourself in a wretchedly unhappy marriage - people may say it should be."" Specialist divorce lawyer Ayesha Vardag said judges should not compel people to stay married. ""This case highlights the absurdity of fault-based divorce,"" she said. ""If a party is willing to go to the Court of Appeal to fight for a divorce, spending significant sums on the way, there is clearly no future for the marriage."" She said it was ""beyond archaic"" that it should have to be proved to a judge.","A woman who says she is ""desperately unhappy"" in her 39-year marriage is fighting a legal battle against a court's refusal to grant her divorce."
"The pilot was the only person on board the water-dropping helicopter, which crashed near the city of Coalinga. California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency as authorities battle hundreds of blazes. Thousands of people have had to flee their homes in areas near San Francisco after several quick-moving wildfires swept into the region. Most at risk is the city of Vacaville, home to about 100,000, which lies between San Francisco and Sacramento. Officials went door-to-door overnight in a frantic effort to clear homes. According to fire officials, 50 structures have burned down in Vacaville, with another 50 damaged by the fire. ""We are experiencing fires the likes of which we haven't seen in many, many years,"" Governor Newsom told reporters. The blazes are thought to have been sparked by a heatwave combined with nearly 11,000 lightning strikes which have hit the state over the last three days. Earlier this week, one of the highest ever temperatures on Earth was recorded in California's Death Valley. Across the US western states on Wednesday, nearly 45 million people were living in areas under some form of excessive heat warning or heat advisory. Mr Newsom said 367 known fires have been recorded so far, but noted that ""the prospect of that going up is very real"". ""As those lightning strikes spark, as you have a lot of smoke, you have a difficult time determining total number of fires until certain things clear and we have the opportunity to go to more remote parts of the state,"" he added. The group of fires in the San Francisco Bay Area was driven by winds throughout Tuesday night and has now grown to 46,000 uncontained acres. The fire, which is larger than city of Washington DC, has injured four people and threatens about 2,000 buildings in Vacaville, authorities say. Video on social media shows flames burning through people's front yards in California's famed wine-producing Napa and Sonoma counties. Smoke also blanketed the city of San Francisco, about 60 miles (95km) south of Vacaville, on Wednesday morning. Fires are also burning in the southern part of the state, where officials described ""extreme fire conditions"" amid the heatwave. Meanwhile, the state's energy operator has pleaded with residents to use less electricity or otherwise face blackouts that would leave millions of people without power for hours at a time. On Tuesday night more than 37,000 customers across California lost power, officials told CNN. So far this year the US has experienced fewer wildfires than in 2019. According to Reuters news agency, around 1.4m fewer acres have burned this year, but the pace is expected to accelerate in the next month as Santa Ana winds reach the south and El Diablo winds strike in the north.",US authorities say the pilot of a helicopter fighting fires in California has died after his aircraft crashed.

Suffolk Fire & Rescue Service confirmed it had sent 16 appliances to the scene, while fire crews from Essex have also been drafted in to battle the blaze. Nick Attfield, from the pub's owners Adnams, called the fire ""devastating"". On Twitter, the fire service said that crews were expected to remain on the scene for the rest of the day. Several road closures are also in place. Group commander Nigel Vincent said crews had tried to ""strip the thatch back to stop the spread of the fire into the main building"". It is not the first time there has been a blaze at The Ship Inn, which overlooks the Orwell estuary between Ipswich and Felixstowe. The pub was closed for two years after a fire destroyed the thatched roof in 2001.

"For a lot of acts on this year's line-up, this is the festival they dreamed of performing at when younger. ""This is the one that means the most because we grew up as fans,"" adds Mikey. And they're not alone in their love for Reading. Mallory Knox The band have played at the festival three times, including two appearances on the main stage. Guitarist Sam Douglas says: ""It's one of those shows that you can build yourself up to but when you're up there and you look out you think 'I'm not really ready for this'. ""We've been doing this for eight years but the one show in the calendar that my family ask to come to is this one. ""That kind of sums it up.

""To be up there it means a lot for us coming form Reading."" Bassist Elliot Briggs adds: ""My first time was in 2005. ""There was a local radio station who hosted a competition. ""Iron Maiden were headlining so you had to bring something that you loved to a car park and they bought a digger along, then they smashed it to pieces and whatever made the best radio got a free weekend ticket. ""We brought our old piano, that's how we got to go. ""It made some really good sounds when it got destroyed."" Three of the members played in a previous band called Peers on the BBC Introducing stage before forming The Amazons. ""We've got the hometown factor but every other band feels the same way,"" explains Matt. ""Its the end of the festival season, there's a backstage area where everyone mixes. ""It's just got a different energy and a different vibe to any other festival in the world. ""It has a lot of weight this show, and a lot of significance. We were on edge the whole time but we kept a lid on it."" You Me At Six This is the seventh time You Me At Six have played at Reading and Leeds. They've played every stage except the dance tent. But frontman Josh Franceschi says ""you never know"" if they'll pop up in the tent at some point.

"Joshua Molnar was cleared of murder and manslaughter following the death of 17-year-old Yousef Makki but was detained after he admitted possessing a knife. The ruling to name him was made after a legal challenge by The Times newspaper. His mother said the teenager, who turns 18 on Tuesday, ""accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence"". But Yousef's family said they had ""never seen a shred of true remorse"" from Molnar or a second defendant - a 17-year-old known in court as Boy B, who also admitted possessing a knife. Manchester Grammar School pupil Yousef died in the attack in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, in March. Molnar was detained for eight months and Boy B for four months - sentences which Yousef's family described as disappointing. The trial heard Molnar acted in self-defence when Yousef pulled out a knife in a row over an attempt to rob a drug dealer. Mr Justice Bryan said that with the agreement of his family, the restriction preventing Molnar being named was ""dispensed with in its entirety"". In a statement following the judge's ruling, Yousef's sister Jade Akoum and mother Deborah Makki said: ""The utter devastation on our lives is indescribable. ""Yousef was a bright and caring boy who had only just started to associate himself with these boys, who were not in any sense his 'best friends'. ""We do not accept for one moment that Yousef's death was merely an accident. ""Together with our legal, campaign and investigation teams, we are exploring all avenues for ensuring that we achieve justice for Yousef. ""We have never seen a shred of true remorse from Joshua Molnar, or the person known for the time being as Boy B."" His mother Deborah Makki said the family was ""broken"" by his death. She told the BBC: ""Every single one of us is broken from my son, my daughters and even grandchildren. Everybody is devastated. ""There is never a normal day when we don't think about Yousef."" Molnar's mother, Stephanie, said: ""Circumstances on the night of 2 March led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife. ""The events of that night were a tragedy. ""I cannot imagine what Yousef's parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this. ""Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence, and the impact of this acceptance is massive. ""He will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.""",A teenager who stabbed his friend in the heart can be named after an order protecting his anonymity was lifted.
"It is the biggest jackpot claimed by an Irish ticket holder in its history. The syndicate is from Naul in north County Dublin, close to the border with County Meath.

'Dream come true' ""This is unbelievable - it will take us some time to get our heads around this win and to organise ourselves,"" he said. ""This is a dream come true. ""We don't want this to change our lives. ""What is so exciting is that we will be able to share this money with children, grandchildren and extended family members."" One of the syndicate members realised their good fortune when she checked the winning ticket after Tuesday night's draw. Argos catalogue She said: ""I heard on the RTÉ news that there was a win in Ireland and I caught the last three numbers. ""I checked the rest of the numbers online. ""I was numb! It took a bit of convincing everybody that we had won."" The family member put the winning ticket in an Argos catalogue and put it under her mattress for safe keeping. ""I didn't sleep a wink all night,"" she added. On Wednesday, the family deposited the winning ticket for safe keeping with the National Lottery and arrangements are now being made for the prize claim to be paid out in the next few weeks. The ticket was bought at Reilly's Daybreak in Naul. Les Reilly, the owner of the shop, said he dropped the phone after finding out he had sold the winning ticket. ""I actually got a sick stomach and my legs started to shake. ""I don't know how the people felt who won it but I was in total shock, just total shock,"" he told BBC News NI. Mr Reilly said the win had whipped up excitement in Naul. ""I've never seen a buzz or anything like this. ""The whole village - a small village in a rural county - it's just buzzing, it's just amazing,"" he said. National Lottery spokeswoman Miriam Donohoe told the BBC the win ""will be a huge shock to the ticket holder"". She said it was the 14th EuroMillions win in Ireland. The previous biggest Irish winner was Dolores McNamara from Limerick, who won €115m (£100m) in 2005. 'Incredible win' Dermot Griffin, the CEO of the National Lottery, said that it has been ""an incredibly lucky period for players on the island of Ireland"". In January a couple from Northern Ireland won a EuroMillions £115m jackpot. Frances and Patrick Connolly, who live in Moira, County Down, matched the winning numbers in the New Year's Day draw.

"It was found on Broad Street outside the Sir Christopher Wren-designed Sheldonian Theatre early on Tuesday. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the small hole concealed a much larger cavity underneath, and water had been found inside it. Thames Water apologised for closing the road, but said it was essential so it could complete repair work safely. The area, which is popular with tourists, has been cordoned off. A Thames Valley spokesman said: ""We will investigate if the burst pipe caused the ground to collapse or vice versa while we carry out the repair. ""We expect to be finished by tomorrow afternoon.""

"By Secunder KermaniBBC News, Quetta Some of the graves are clustered together, where family members have been buried side by side. The district in south-west Pakistan is almost entirely populated by the minority Hazara community, which belongs to the Shia sect of Islam. For decades they have been targeted by sectarian extremists using suicide bombings and targeted shootings. Daoud Agha, president of the Balochistan Shia Conference, is defiant: ""Children have been orphaned, wives have been widowed, but we will never abandon our faith."" This year more than a dozen Hazaras have been killed in and around Quetta, but in the past the annual death toll was far higher. In 2013 more than 200 were killed. But for the Hazara community the reduction of violence has come at a cost, its members are now effectively living in ghettos that many describe as a prison. The response from the Pakistani authorities to the wave of violence against the Hazara has been to build walls blocking streets leading to their districts from elsewhere in the city, or place military checkpoints along them. There are no longer attacks inside Hazara areas, but elsewhere in the city they have continued to be targeted. As a result the Hazara community has been confined to two parts of the city; anyone who wants to enter them is questioned by soldiers. The checkpoints may be for the safety of the residents, but they aren't popular. 'Living in a cage' Not far from the cemetery, on the Alamdar Road, once the site of many of the attacks, one resident, Haji Mohammed Musa, railed against the measures. ""Yes, violence here has come down, but we can't go anywhere else in the city. We can't do business any more. We're living in a cage,"" he says. The community once dominated the main bazaar in the city, now nearly all those with shops there have relocated into one of the two Hazara districts. Mr Musa, like many others, believes more should be done to target the militants responsible for the violence: ""If a government can't deal with a handful of terrorists, how can they call themselves a government?"" Leaving Mari Abad can prove deadly. Hazaras are said to be the descendants of Mongols, and are identifiable from their distinct facial features. Who are the Hazara? In October, vegetable seller Abdul Ghafoor set off in a pick-up truck with five others to visit a wholesale market in the centre of the city. He says he knew it could be dangerous but went because vegetables in Mari Abad are much more expensive than those elsewhere in Quetta. He was the only one who returned home. ""Suddenly the car stopped and gunshots rang out. I tried to get up to see what was happening. That's when I was hit. I fell unconscious."" Abdul Ghafoor was shot five times but survived. Now, though, he says he will never leave Mari Abad again, nor will he allow his family to do so. His two young sons have dropped out of school to work on his stall while he recovers. They're part of a generation of Hazaras that community leaders fear will grow up never mixing with other ethnic groups living in the same city. The number of Hazara students in Quetta's universities, located outside Mari Abad, is said to have fallen dramatically. Escape in parkour One outlet for the frustration felt by many young Hazaras is sport. Parkour, a form of urban gymnastics, is growing increasingly popular. Ali Reza, 16, says it gives him a feeling of freedom. ""Parents are afraid of losing their children, they won't permit us to go anywhere. We are trapped in a prison. [Parkour] makes me forget all my worries, I feel like I have wings,"" he says. Ali Reza lives in Quetta's only other Hazara district, Hazara Town. The community is split between these two enclaves, and many fear they will be targeted if they try to travel from one to the other. Ali Reza and his friends do visit Mari Abad - they like taking photos of each other with the mountains surrounding the district in the background, but they don't tell their families. Another of his friends, whose father was murdered in a targeted shooting, says wistfully: ""If security was better we could invite guys from other communities to join us and learn parkour too. But at the moment it's not safe enough to even meet them.""","Close to 1,000 victims of militant attacks are said to be buried in the cemetery of the Mari Abad district of Quetta."
"He became a global star in 1997 after surviving four days in the upturned hull of his boat which capsized during a solo round-the-world race. Mr Bullimore moved to Bristol in the early 1960s and married Lalel, a West Indian immigrant with whom he opened the Bamboo Club, which hosted Bob Marley. He had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Mr Bullimore earned the nickname the British Bulldog after his dramatic rescue during the Vendée Globe. His nephew Stephen Mulvaney said: ""He was crazy, full of life, a character - he liked to get things done. ""I think he felt a bit sad that the rescue was what he was known for and yet over the years he has won so many trophies and won so many races."" Extraordinary survival feat He was feared to have drowned after his boat, the Exide Challenger, capsized in the freezing waters of the Southern Ocean in 1997. After four days it was spotted by an Australian navy ship and Mr Bullimore was rescued. The Queen praised Mr Bullimore's ""extraordinary feat of survival"" and he was later introduced to Her Majesty. The sailor famously crouched in the upturned hull of his yacht, surviving on chocolate and water. Bristol's Lord Mayor Cleo Lake paid tribute to Mr Bullimore, whom she called ""a Bristol legend both on the waters and on the music scene"". The Bamboo Club, which opened in 1966, attracted many of the big names in reggae and offered a place for people of all backgrounds to socialise safely. It hosted stars including Bob Marley and the Wailers, as well as Ben E King, before it closed 11 years after opening because of a fire. Roy Hackett, who was instrumental in the 1963 Bristol bus boycott, said that before the club opened: ""You couldn't go into pubs in Bristol on your own if you were black. You'd get a hiding."" Mr and Mrs Bullimore also experienced racism as a mixed race couple. Mr Bullimore was a renowned philanthropist and in a 2016 documentary made by BBC Radio Bristol, one friend described him as ""generous and humble, who helped thousands of black people"". In 2000 he starred in a BBC documentary with the comedian Sir Lenny Henry as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean.",Sailor and entrepreneur Tony Bullimore has died at the age of 79.
"By Ed RamBBC News It sounds like a no-brainer. A tried and tested network of listening sensors are placed around a city and can instantly pinpoint where a gunshot has come from within seconds of the weapon being fired. ShotSpotter promises to save police having to hunt door-to-door in the vague vicinity of a blast. It analyses the way the sound waves from the gun firing radiate out reaching microphones at slightly different times. Its maker SST says it can distinguish the sound of a bullet being fired from fireworks and other types of explosion, count how many shots were fired and even deduce how many gunmen were involved. San Francisco is scaling up its use of the tech - and it's also been deployed in Miami, Boston, Puerto Rico and Rio de Janeiro. But an effort to use it to combat gun crime in the UK was abandoned when authorities in the city of Birmingham reported ""technical difficulties"". So, what went wrong - and would it be worth reconsidering? Privacy concerns In December 2010, West Midlands Police were optimistic about what the innovation could achieve. The cost of investigating a single murder could run to £1m. By contrast, installing the system cost £150,000 and a further £21,000 a year to maintain. ""We're delighted to be the first city in the UK to secure this technology,"" said Ch Supt Chris McKeogh at the time. Some residents expressed concern that their conversations might be picked up - a previous effort to install hidden CCTV cameras in the city had proven controversial and had to be abandoned - but the police assured them this would not happen. But just 20 months later ShotSpotter was judged to be a second failure. In August 2012 West Midlands Police said of 1,618 alerts produced by the system since November 2011, only two were confirmed gunfire incidents. What's more, the force added, ShotSpotter had also missed four confirmed shootings. Its conclusion was that resources would be best spent elsewhere. Ch Supt Clive Burgess said the system had ""struggled to work"" and that in future officers would instead focus on day-to-day community policing, anti-gun education programmes and the work of the counter-gang task force. Air gun problem Now that the dust has settled, SST is willing to discuss what went wrong. James Beldock, the firm's senior vice president of products, said the figures quoted two years ago were misleading. ""There were only two cases of an actual firearm shooting being missed [by SST] over an 18-month period,"" he said. ""The other two were air guns, which ShotSpotter is explicitly not designed to detect."" He acknowledged there were ""technical problems"", which caused the system to be less accurate than normal, but suggested this could have been avoided if the city had been more committed to the idea. ""SST originally proposed a density of ShotSpotter sensors of approximately 10 per square kilometre,"" he said. ""Such sensor densities are standard for our international deployments - Brazil, South Africa, Panama, etc. ""Unfortunately, budget constraints pushed West Midlands Police to reduce that density. We take partial responsibility for permitting the budget to drive the decision, along with West Midlands Police."" The firm had learnt from this mistake and made other changes to improve the system. SST staff now monitor all the sensors deployed worldwide through a central base in the US to confirm the cause of each explosion, rather than leaving such a judgement to local law enforcers on the ground. And a new generation of sensor - with approximately 10 times the processing power - has now been introduced, Mr Bedlock said. Even so, Birmingham - and other UK cities that eyed ShotSpotter - might be wise to remain reticent. ShotSpotter is optimised to handle the very specific noises, frequencies and decibel levels created by conventional weapons. But while such weapons may be relatively easy to come by in the US and parts of Latin America, they are less common in the UK. As a result, criminals in Britain often resort to other types of firearms, including ones that shoot pellets and electric stun guns. A review of the 22 injuries caused by guns in Birmingham's west and central areas between April 2011 and March 2012 reveals that the majority were the result of air-rifles and BB air guns. ""A higher sensor density might permit such modified weapons to be detected, but the economic equation would, again, need to be reviewed,"" said Mr Bedlock. It's not impossible that ShotSpotter will return to the UK. The Home Office notes that it is ""down to each regional police force"" as to whether it invests in the equipment. But for now it seems this is one instance where the traditional trumps cutting edge tech - at least where British cities are involved. Watch more clips on the Click website.

"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent The country's economy grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of the year after contracting in the previous three months. A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity. Germany's strength as an exporter of manufactured goods has left it exposed to recent conflict in global trade. The growth figure was the right side of zero but it is still very weak. Putting together the new figures and the previous quarter's performance, the economy did shrink slightly over the six month period. Trade is a central element in this story. The value of total German exports - including services - is about 47% of the country's whole economy, its gross domestic product or GDP. There is a lot of imported content in those exports. So an alternative way of looking at it is the value added in Germany of the goods it sells abroad. That is about a third of GDP. Manufacturing challenges For such a big economy, those figures are very large. They reflect the strength of the country's manufacturing industry. Manufactured goods are more extensively traded than services. The figures mean Germany has been very vulnerable to adverse winds in global commerce. The tensions that have followed the more assertive approach of US President Donald Trump's administration are a case in point. Germany has been affected through several channels. The conflict between the US and China has affected the Chinese economy which is an important buyer of German vehicles and industrial equipment. There have been US tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. And more recently US tariffs in retaliation over subsidies to the European aircraft maker Airbus have targeted the four individual countries responsible for most of the financial support - Germany, along with the UK, France and Spain. No surprise then that German economic growth has been slower this year. The newest figures show that exports did increase in the third quarter of the 2019. But sales abroad have been hit and the risks to exporters remain significant. Car industry struggling It is not all down to trade. Germany's motor industry has had a hard time with emissions issues. Volkswagen was the central player in the scandal over emissions test cheating. And now there are further issues with the need to adapt to new European Union rules on greenhouse gas emissions and the related challenge of making the transition to electric powered vehicles, which requires massive investment. There is also a widely held view in Germany that the country needs a major investment programme to improve its infrastructure, in areas such as rail, bridges and broadband. All that said it bears emphasising that Germany has one of the lowest unemployment rates on the planet at 3.1%. It has also seen the number of people with jobs continue to grow this year, although more slowly than in the recent past. It is also the case that in terms of the recovery from the financial crisis Germany is a relatively strong performer. Among the G7 group of leading developed economies, Germany comes out best compared with pre-crisis levels in terms of GDP per capita, a somewhat rough and ready indicator of average living standards.","Germany has narrowly avoided a recession, according to new official data."
"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Contracting company Black & McDonald said in a Facebook post that the individual concerned is ""no longer employed"" with them after a video of their anti-social behaviour went viral, Canadian broadcaster CBC reports.

"The IFS said that the difference had been particularly strong since 2008. The poorest 20% of households faced an average annual inflation rate of 4.3% between 2008 and 2010, while the richest 20% only had a rate of 2.7%. People on lower incomes spend more of their money on gas, electricity and food, which have risen sharply. At the same time, people with higher incomes have benefited more from lower mortgage rates. Pensioners have experienced higher inflation than non-pensioners and pensioners relying on state benefits have been hit particularly hard. Inflation inequality means, ""that poorer households will have fared worse over the period of the recession than poverty and inequality statistics that don't account for these differential inflation rates would suggest,"" according to Peter Levell from the IFS. In 2009, the poorest 20% of households spent 9.4% of their incomes on household fuel, while the richest 20% spent only 4.4%. That year, electricity prices rose 4.6% and gas prices rose 13.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics, and those rises would have had a bigger effect on households spending a higher proportion of their income on fuel. The Retail Prices Index covering all items for that year was 2.4%. The highest 20% are those with annual incomes above £25,012 for a single person or £37,336 for a couple. The lowest 20% of households are those with an annual income below £8,736 for a single person or £13,052 for a couple. Market research company TNS said it was clear that people, particularly on low to middle incomes, were changing their shopping habits as a result of rising prices. ""We are seeing people move to the deep discounters - Aldi and Netto - who are doing very well,"" said Dr Michelle Harrison from TNS. ""We are seeing more 'small-basket shops', as people are trying trying to avoid waste. ""And people are changing brands, being very savvy about the kind of products they are buying. They are not necessarily buying the more expensive brands,"" she added.","People on low incomes have suffered higher inflation than those on higher incomes in the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said."
"The Chinese company is one of the major manufacturers of essential equipment for 5G networks. Huawei said continuing the 5G rollout was the best way to ensure connectivity during the crisis. But senior executive Eric Xu also told reporters the delays could last until “the time when the pandemic is brought under control"". Answering questions about its annual report, published on Tuesday, Huawei vice-president Victor Zhang said there would “definitely” be an impact but it would not be as significant in the UK as the rest of Europe. The first priority was to ensure the existing network was reliable, as people were using it to work, entertain and learn from home, he said. But given the demand for bandwidth and better coverage, “the quickest way is to use the 5G deployment”. “We need to accelerate the network bandwidth… to make sure everyone can work and can entertain and can share information,” he said. Mr Zhang pointed to rural areas in particular, where existing mobile broadband coverage “is not good enough” to support people working from home. “On the other hand, [we must] consider the health and safety issue, especially for protecting our employees and our partners,” he said. Before the crisis, Huawei’s role in Europe’s 5G networks was deeply controversial. The UK had decided to allow the Chinese company a limited role, and France and Germany appeared poised to go down a similar route - but pressure was mounting from the US and some UK politicians for a ban. Now, Huawei, while conceding there will be some delays in 5G deployment, has insisted they will be minimal - and seems to think nothing has really changed. That may be naive on the company’s part. While nothing has really changed when it comes to the technical and security issues around Huawei’s equipment, the political climate for the company has certainly worsened. A story in the Mail on Sunday at the weekend had Downing Street warning China “faced a reckoning” over its handling of the coronavirus. And that is likely to embolden those MPs who have been telling the government no Chinese company should be allowed a role in the UK’s vital infrastructure. Huawei’s maintenance staff were designated as essential workers in the UK, Mr Zhang said, which meant they could continue to do repairs - but also contribute to the rollout of new 5G base stations. And the company had put many extra spare parts in three UK warehouses when the virus had broken out in China, to make sure its supply chain suffered as little impact as possible. Mr Xu said China had accelerated its own 5G deployment after the number of cases of Covid-19 subsided - but in other countries, it would depend “on several factors”, including whether telecoms companies had the budget and resources to “win back the time” lost. In January, despite opposition from the United States, which claims the company is a security risk, UK officials decided to allow Huawei to supply a little more than a third of the UK’s 5G infrastructure, excluding sensitive “core” parts of network. European powers shortly followed suit in a recommendation to member states. And since then, Huawei says, it has since seen a “very good pace” of 5G network deployment in Europe and particularly in the UK.","The rollout of 5G mobile networks in Europe will “certainly be delayed” by the coronavirus outbreak, Huawei says."
"First Minister Mark Drakeford had earlier told AMs the Welsh Government did have a deal with Roche. It emerged on Saturday an agreement to provide 5,000 extra tests a day had collapsed but ministers had refused to name the firm. Wales is now part of a UK roll-out of testing. Responding to a question from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, Mr Drakeford said: ""We did have a deal, it was a deal that we had with Roche."" ""We believe that it was a deal that ought to have been honoured. ""We now have access to a supply of tests from a consortium of suppliers that will give us a considerable uplift in testing here in Wales. ""Truthfully, what I believe patients are interested in is that testing will be available, that staff can be tested and go back to work, and some of the detail of how that came about is not, I think, uppermost in the minds of people who need that testing. ""They want to know it's there and is going to be available, and available in greater numbers, and we can be confident of that."" Mr Price said he welcomed the first minister's decision to name Roche as the company involved but said more information was needed. ""We still don't know why the deal collapsed in the first place,"" he said. ""It is in the public interest that the Welsh Government and Roche tell us what exactly happened to make the agreement fail."" A spokeswoman for Roche Diagnostics said it never had ""a contract or agreement directly with Wales to supply testing"". ""Our absolute priority and focus at this time is to support the UK government and NHS to scale up testing across the whole of the UK, including in Wales. ""As part of the centralised roll-out of testing, we will continue to speak to colleagues at Public Health Wales to move this forward as quickly as possible."" Stephen Crabb, the Conservative chair of the Welsh Affairs committee,said the reported collapse raised questions about ""co-ordination and co-operation between Whitehall and Cardiff Bay in the procurement of tests and other essential equipment"". He has written to Welsh Secretary Simon Hart asking for clarification on what knowledge the UK government had of the deal, whether the company had also been in negotiations with Public Health England and on the steps the UK government was taking to work with the Welsh Government on testing. ""The people of Wales need an urgent assurance that the UK and Welsh governments are working together effectively to ensure all corners of the UK are given their fair share of testing kits,"" he said.","A pharmaceutical firm has said it ""never had a contract or agreement directly with Wales"" to supply coronavirus testing."
"Cabot Learning Federation (CLF) will open Tower Road Academy on its Digitech secondary school grounds in 2021. The academy trust said the school would meet future need for primary places as new housing is to be built nearby. But some parents in nearby Cadbury Heath say more funding is needed for existing schools. The government money - capital funding - is specifically intended for building new schools. 'Provide places' The chief executive of the Cabot Learning Federation, Steve Tyler, said: ""This is different funding; this is a capital project and the per pupil funding will follow as the pupils join the schools. ""It's not diluting the money that's already in the authority. ""It will face the same funding formula that other schools face, but we still need to provide places for children in the area."" Parents whose children attend the nearby Cadbury Heath Primary were concerned about ongoing funding struggles. One mother told BBC Radio Bristol: ""It's not a good idea; the money is not around to fund it afterwards. They are struggling with money now."" A father said: ""A lot of parents can't get siblings into the same school, so that would be a good thing."" Parent Lucy Morgan, from Hanham, said: ""It will create competition for other primaries and if they don't get full classes it will affect their per pupil funding."" The funding problems in South Gloucestershire schools was also featured in a BBC Two documentary, School, where education funding challenges were highlighted. This led to the council awarding capital funding, but not money for ongoing needs such as staffing and books.",A new primary school for Warmley has been confirmed as part of a wave of government funding for 22 free schools .
"By Toby MasonPolitical reporter, BBC Wales Even as Tories worked side-by-side with their coalition partners across Whitehall, since May 2010, Gwydyr House has remained a Tory-only zone, with the now former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan and her then deputy Mr Jones running the show. But the rumours were true, and Baroness Randerson - in a previous political life the Liberal Democrat AM for Cardiff Central, Jenny Randerson, has been appointed a deputy. But not, it transpires, the deputy to David Jones. Why not? Because instead of one deputy, Mr Jones will have two - with the Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire Stephen Crabb also joining the Wales Office - but remaining also in his old job in the whips office - and possibly in a more senior role. Confused? You could be forgiven. If the promotion of David Jones was predictable, the appointment of his deputies - and the manner of it - has been anything but. Political pundits and and opposition politicians are scratching their heads at Mr Crabb's two jobs. Traditionally the whips have been a breed apart, keeping the discipline among unruly backbenchers, not getting their hands dirty at the departmental coalface. Whips don't often speak in the Commons, if ever, so that will be another novelty for the man from Pembrokeshire should he also be fielding questions at the dispatch box. The appointment of Baroness Randerson is, if anything, more intriguing. In her response to her appointment she says she is delighted and honoured to be taking on the role and ""as a committed devolutionist... particularly looking forward to developing the working relationship between the Welsh government and the Wales Office to ensure that we all work together to enhance the lives of the people of Wales"". Unpopular proposals That may come as some relief to those at the top of the Welsh government whose welcome for Mr Jones was lukewarm, based on a somewhat astringent relationship in the past. They may find the baroness more emollient - assuming her new boss is willing for her to take that role. One downside for the Welsh Liberal Democrats in the assembly is that their recent strategy of distancing themselves from the more unpopular proposals of the UK government, such as regional pay and cuts to welfare, will now be a whole lot harder with one of their former colleagues newly installed in the Wales Office.","As David Cameron's reshuffle unfolded, the rumours grew that the new Welsh secretary, David Jones, might get an unexpected deputy - the Liberal Democrat Baroness Randerson."
"The law already states consent must be given fully and freely, but the new guidance instructs officials to look at the whole context of a rape allegation. It spells out that behaviour such as staying silent or using contraception does not signify consent. The CPS said it would help dispel ""myths and stereotypes"" about rape. The document specifies that consent cannot be given where someone is incapacitated through drink or drugs or where a suspect held a position of power over the potential victim as a teacher, an employer or a doctor. The ability to consent to sex should also be questioned where someone has mental health problems, learning difficulties or was asleep or unconscious at the time of an alleged attack, it said. Situations involving previous incidents of domestic violence or those where the complainant ""may be financially or otherwise dependent on their alleged rapist"" should also be scrutinised, according to the CPS. 'Strong cases' Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders told the BBC: ""This is really about making sure investigators and prosecutors look at the whole context, so we're able to put strong cases before the court and we don't just focus on what a victim did or said."" She added: ""We know there are too many myths and stereotypes around rape and consent and this is about making sure we really examine cases."" The guidelines were launched at the first national conference on rape investigations, held jointly by the CPS and police forces in England and Wales. Speaking at the conference, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said: ""There is still far too much variation in the way that forces move a complaint of rape through the system."" He highlighted problems around police deciding in favour of ""no further action"" or recording ""no crime"". Survivors' fear These issues need to be tackled in order to ""send a clear and unequivocal message to victims about how they will be treated,"" the assistant commissioner urged. Katie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales, welcomed the move, saying that the charity had observed that ""among the many reasons for survivors' reluctance to report is fear, including fear of not being well treated by the criminal justice system."" She said she hoped the guidance would further ""the cultural shift necessary for sexual violence survivors to receive the criminal justice they want and deserve"". The advice forms part of a wider drive known as the rape action plan which was launched earlier in January by the CPS and is aimed at securing more successful prosecutions for rape.",Advice to police in England and Wales clarifying the circumstances in which a person can consent to sex has been given by the Crown Prosecution Service.
"Mr Litvinenko died in a London hospital in 2006 after being poisoned with radioactive polonium-210. Mr Lugovoi, who is said to have left a trail of polonium around London, is accused by British police of lacing Mr Litvinenko's tea with the poison. 'Criminal matter' But Mr Lugovoi continues to protest his innocence. Russian officials have said they will not hand him over because it would violate the country's constitution. Reacting to Britain's formal request for his extradition in May 2007, Mr Lugovoi said: ""They [Britain] think that they found a Russian James Bond that penetrates nuclear facilities and, in cold blood, poisons his friend, and at the same time poisoning himself, his friends, his wife and children."" Mr Lugovoi claims that Mr Litvinenko was a British spy, and has suggested that either the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, commonly known as MI6) carried out the killing, or Mr Litvinenko accidentally poisoned himself. ""Even if [MI6] hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance,"" said Mr Lugovoi. Mr Lugovoi also claimed MI6 tried to recruit him to provide ""compromising information"" on then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Foreign Office said that the matter was a criminal rather than an intelligence matter. ""A British citizen was killed in London and UK citizens and visitors were put at risk,"" said a Foreign Office spokesman. The Crown Prosecution Service says it has enough evidence to charge Mr Lugovoi with the murder of Mr Litvinenko. Traces of the radioactive substance polonium-210, which caused Mr Litvinenko's death, have been found in a string of places Mr Lugovoi visited in London. On 16 October, he visited Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge, where two rooms were later found to be contaminated. He later met Mr Litvinenko in the Itsu sushi restaurant in Piccadilly, which was also found afterwards to have traces of the substance. Then he stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel in London's Mayfair, where another two rooms were found to be heavily contaminated. Fatal meeting On 1 November came the meeting with Mr Litvinenko, along with two other Russians, in the Pine Bar at the Millennium Hotel, which investigators believe proved fatal. A cup, teapot, the bar and bar staff are all believed to have tested positive for polonium-210. Investigators suspect that a phial of polonium-210 could have been tipped into Mr Litvinenko's tea. Mr Lugovoi has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, suggesting that someone has been trying to frame him. He underwent medical checks in hospital after traces of polonium-210 were reportedly found in his body. He has also been questioned by Russian and British detectives as a witness. In 2011, Mr Lugovoi told the BBC he was aware that the case was causing an impasse in British-Russian relations. He suggested getting a third country to conduct an independent investigation. Mr Lugovoi was elected to the Russian parliament, the Duma, in December 2007, as a representative of the right-wing nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky. In March 2009, the party announced that Mr Lugovoi would be its candidate for the elections of the Mayor of Sochi, the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics. However, he decided to remain as an MP in the Duma and seek re-election to the Russian parliament in 2011.","A former KGB officer, who is now a lawmaker in the Russian parliament, Andrei Lugovoi, remains the main suspect in the killing of the former Russian agent, Alexander Litvinenko."
"By Ed Thomas and Claire KendallBBC News Children from poorer families did at least one hour less learning a day compared with those in richer families, the Institute of Fiscal Studies found. One head teacher says it could take up to two years to bring some children back to their correct attainment level. The government said a £350m tutoring scheme would help disadvantaged pupils. 'There's already a gap' The IFS surveyed the parents of 5,500 school-aged children in England during lockdown. It compared the richest 20% of pupils with the poorest 20%. In May, the IFS said children from wealthier families were spending more time studying during the pandemic than poorer children. And in its latest research, the think tank gives a more detailed picture of how coronavirus has widened the gap between the richest and poorest primary school children. Its findings suggest richer primary school children spent 75 minutes a day more on educational activities, compared with those in poorer families during lockdown. Data from five years ago suggested there was no gap in learning time among primary school pupils. Resources provided by schools are also unequally distributed, the IFS suggested. Around 42% of poorer primary-aged children received some sort of online lesson, conference call or support from their school, compared to 58% of richer children. And the IFS said it found evidence suggesting children who have had better access to learning resources are also more likely to spend more time learning than children who do not. Richer children were (37%) more likely to have their own space to study than their poorer counterparts. And although a large majority of children from all backgrounds had access to a computer or tablet, richer children were also more likely to have access to a computer or tablet. Kirsty Tennyson is Executive Principal of the Three Saints Academy Trust and one of her schools is St Mary and St Thomas C of E in St Helens. More than 60% of the children are on free school meals and nearly half have a special need. ""In a deprived area there is already a gap that we're striving to close - to narrow and ultimately to close [the gap],"" she says. ""Children who have not got that support at home and have not been able to access that learning - that gap will have grown hugely."" Ms Tennyson says her schools have detailed plans for the start of term to help the children catch up, but she admits there is a ""mountain to climb"". ""This is going to take into this academic year and the one after to really get those children back to where they need to be and for some children it will take longer."" Phoebe is 11 years old and starts secondary school next month. She was using the home learning packs her school, St Mary and St Thomas, provided until she want back to school in June. ""I do struggle with maths so I have been worried if I do go down,"" she says of her learning. Her dad, George, is a single parent and says he has worked hard - with assistance from the school - to help Phoebe with her school work. ""I failed in maths,"" he says. ""The school helped me get my English qualification. If I don't know [the work], I can't help my child."" He added: ""Phoebe's school has always helped because they're always on the end of the phone."" Last month, the Department for Education announced a national tutoring programme, including £350m of funding for additional targeted support for children and young people aged 5-19 years who are most in need of help. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the fund would help head teachers provide what pupils need. A spokesman said ""being in school is vital for children's education and wellbeing, which is why making sure all pupils return to the classroom in September is a national priority"".","Lockdown widened learning gaps between richer and poorer primary school children, an analysis of thousands of families in England suggests."

"By Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News It will be used at a farm-scale level if infected badgers are found on a site. This is despite scientific evidence that culling at a local level increases TB infection in cattle. Details of the plan were given by the country's Chief Vet, Prof Christianne Glossop, at a symposium on cattle TB in London. Prof Glossop told BBC News that she could not be certain that culling badgers at a farm-scale level would not increase TB infection but said she wanted to try out culling in situations where all other measures had failed. ""I agree that there is a risk, but some of these farms have been under TB restrictions for over 10 years. We have removed cattle after cattle, increased biosecurity - but the farmer still has TB infection,"" she explained. The Welsh government stressed that the culls would not be like those in England where culling companies shoot both infected and non infected badgers. Instead, only infected badgers would be killed humanely. Read also: 'Fake science used to back badger culls' 'Counter productive' An extensive assessment of badger culling carried out in the 1990s showed that culling badgers on a small area such as a farm increased infection. The researchers at the time speculated that this was because the culling increased the movement of badgers. It is for this reason that culls in England are conducted over very large areas greater than 150 square kilometres, where researchers believe the proportion of infected badgers moving is small relative to the area culled. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was among those who carried out the so-called Randomised Badger Control Trial (RBCT), criticised the Welsh plan. ""The Welsh government has made great strides in reducing cattle TB through improved cattle testing. It seems a great shame to risk undoing all that progress by farm-scale badger culling, which all the evidence shows is likely to increase cattle TB rather than reducing it. ""The Welsh plan is to kill only badgers that test positive for TB - but that approach was tried in the 1990s. Then, testing was shown to miss a high proportion of the infected badgers, leaving them to spread the disease. And, more recent research suggests that killing even a small number of badgers is enough to disrupt social behaviour, potentially spreading TB over a wider area."" 'Flawed approach' Prof Glossop said that Prof Woodroffe's 1990s trail might be flawed because it was interrupted by the foot-and-mouth epidemic. And she added that the proposed Welsh culls would be carried using a ""completely different approach"". Under her scheme, farms where TB infections have been endemic will be assessed to see if there are infected badgers on the site. If there are, badgers on the farm will be culled each year until the infection disappears. The farm will be monitored and if TB infection in cattle increases, culling will stop. ""We all find ourselves turning to the RBCT for our evidence base because it was the largest and most extensive study that anyone has ever done. But although it was a very well designed and carefully supervised study, you have to face the fact that some elements of the trial on the ground did not quite meet the objectives of the study. ""And although it is said that there was an increase in infection because of an increased movement of badgers, nobody has proved that."" Farmers' heartache The farms where TB infections are high are in the South West and on the border with England. If infected badgers are found on these farms, culling could begin this year. The Welsh government has been very successful in reducing TB in cattle though a rigorous cattle-testing programme. Infected animals have been removed and slaughtered since 2009. It has also had a programme of badger vaccination in parts of Pembrokeshire. In that time incidence of TB in cattle has been reduced by 48%. There are currently just under 12,000 herd of cattle in Wales. More than 95% of them are TB free. Of the 500 herds that have TB, it is persistent in 50 or 60 of these herds where traditional approaches have been infective - and it is in these areas that farm-scale badger culling will be tried out. ""These (TB infections) are causing a lot of heartache,"" said Prof Glossop. ""They are costing a lot of money and are a reservoir of infection in itself.""

"The panel will resume considering the involuntary manslaughter charge against Dr Conrad Murray on Monday. Fans of Jackson, who died in June 2009, gathered outside the Los Angeles court, carrying signs asking for a ""one way ticket to jail"" for the accused. If convicted, Dr Murray, 58, could face four years in prison and lose his licence to practise medicine. The cardiologist denies giving Jackson an overdose of the powerful sedative propofol to help him sleep. The jury of seven men and five women heard from 49 witnesses and saw more than 300 pieces of evidence over the six weeks of the trial. There was no sign of Dr Murray on Friday or his legal team, but they are to receive a two-hour notice once a verdict is reached. During closing statements on Thursday, the prosecution said the world had lost a ""genius"", while the defence characterised Murray as ""a little fish in a big dirty pond"". Prosecutors said Dr Murray's care of the pop star had been ""bizarre"" and left the pop star's children fatherless. They projected images of Jackson's grief-stricken children on a giant screen. The children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, who range in ages from 9 to 14, were not in court on Thursday, but Jackson's parents and several of his siblings were present. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said the accused had caused the star's death through negligence and greed, and had essentially been experimenting on Jackson. The defence countered that the singer had caused his own death by injecting a dose of propofol while his doctor was out of the room. ""They want you to convict Dr Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson,"" defence lawyer Ed Chernoff said. Dr Murray chose not to testify in his own defence.",The jury has ended its first day of deliberation in the trial of the man accused over Michael Jackson's death.
"Brusthom Ziamani, 25, and Baz Hockton, 26, deny trying to kill Neil Trundle in a ""terror attack"" at HMP Whitemoor, Cambridgeshire, on 9 January. Prosecutors have said the pair ""lured"" Mr Trundle to a store cupboard where they launched the assault with makeshift weapons. Security video appears to show two men pushing an officer through a doorway. Giving evidence, Mr Trundle told an Old Bailey jury he went to open a store cupboard after the defendants asked him to replace a broken spoon. As he unlocked the door he saw one of the men in his ""peripheral view"", he said. ""Before I knew it I was on the floor on my back... I did not know what position I was in but I was on the floor and I was being attacked."" He told jurors he had felt ""blows coming down"" and fought off ""repeated stabbing blows to the head"". The court has previously heard terror convict Mr Ziamani and radicalised Mr Hockton wore imitation suicide belts and shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" - God is greatest - during the attack. Mr Trundle, who has been a prison officer for more than 14 years, said he ""was too busy trying to survive"" to hear what his attackers were saying. ""They were focusing on my head, my neck, all vital organs. They had ample opportunity to stab me in the leg or kick me in the leg but they just carried on with the top half,"" he said. The officer told jurors he had not had any problems or ""cross words"" with Mr Ziamani before. He said Mr Hockton ""follows in the footsteps of Mr Ziamani"", and he had noticed him copying his co-accused's ""abnormal"" behaviour by sleeping under his bed. Under cross-examination, Mr Trundle denied that he ""had it in"" for Mr Hockton or had ever asked him why he was ""wearing a dress"". Prosecutors alleged the pair used ""painstakingly constructed"" makeshift weapons and ""were motivated to commit the attack by extremist Islamic ideology"". Jurors were told that an alternative count of inflicting wounding with intent in relation to Mr Trundle is available for Mr Ziamani. The alternative charge need only be considered if the jury acquit him of attempted murder. Hockton has already pleaded guilty to that alternative offence, thereby accepting that he intended to cause really serious harm to Mr Trundle, but not accepting that he intended to kill him. Ziamani has pleaded guilty to assaulting a female prison officer and a nurse who intervened in the attack, the court was told. The trial continues.

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter She wasn't doing it to sell a song but to promote her ""Back to Nature"" garden at this year's Chelsea Flower Show, a co-created ""woodland wilderness"" designed to promote the benefits of an outdoor life for mental and physical wellbeing. It is a project she has put her heart and soul and back into (17 hours of hard labour according to the man in charge of helping realise her vision). The future Queen is now something of an old hand, whereas I arrived for the press view on Monday as a Chelsea Flower Show virgin. My innocence was clearly obvious. I was barely in and still fumbling my way around when a smartly dressed middle-aged man with an impeccable side parting pulled me aside to tell me all about the birds and the bees. I thought this was ground I had covered, what with four grown-up children and all, but I was wrong. I had no idea - for example - that shags were under threat, or of the problems associated with the common thrush. But I quickly learnt that both are on the RSPB's Red List of endangered bird species native to Britain. Although, they were not my man's concern. Bees were in his bonnet. He wanted to show me his company's (McQueens Flowers) 20-metre long, spiralling, iridescent, upside-down lavender field-cum-sculpture called Per Oculus Apum (Through the Eyes of Bees), situated in an old concrete tunnel. It was a mighty impressive, multi-sensory ceiling that made for an immersive environment (honey perfume wafted through the air) giving punters a bees-eye view of the world. It was an evocative installation, but without the star-power of the Duchess's child-friendly, periwinkle-filled playground, which had the added buzz - as if it were needed - of a free limoncello drink (with optional champagne). It was an offer swarms of celebrity guests could not refuse, one of whom described the Chelsea Flower Show as ""a wonderful place to be seen"". Maybe the lady in question was planning on coming back as a tree next year. She wouldn't be out of place, performance and art is definitely a recurring theme. Several of the gardens boasted impromptu shows. There was a gospel choir banging out numbers in the Morgan Stanley Garden. A topless woman with strategically placed painted roses wandered around unintentionally inconspicuous (who wants to look at fake flowers when you can see and smell the real thing?). And the poet Ian McMillan read a piece he'd written for the Welcome to Yorkshire Garden. He was good, but the garden was better. It was designed by Mark Gregory who had taken the concept of a water feature to such an extreme as to makes a Louis VIX fountain seem unimaginative. Into the small patch of land designated to each of the show gardens. Gregory had wedged in: a water-filled, fully-functioning lock, a wild perennial garden (including lupins and stinging nettles), a lock keeper's cottage, a vegetable patch, stone walls and paths, and a variety of trees native to Yorkshire. The Manchester Garden had a flowing, organic sculpture by Liam Hopkins, whose introduction to art and technology was as a young child when he took apart a video recorder having posted a slice of toast into its cassette bay. From little rascals do mighty... carbon fibre objects grow. Painted white by Hopkins to represent the city's past as ""Cottonopolis"", he then perforated it with hand-cut shapes to reflect the molecular structure of both cotton and graphene (first isolated in Manchester). One approach would have been to simply place it as a folly within an urban garden. But the designers wisely chose to integrate it into the fabric of their watery landscape, with flowers and trees growing through its many shapely holes. It's not something you'll be seeing in Tate Modern any time soon, but in the context of The Manchester Garden it worked well as a compositional device. You won't be seeing John Everiss's art down on Bankside either, but that doesn't mean it is not worthy of your attention. The multi-award-winning garden designer's D-Day 75th anniversary installation was a thoughtful tribute to all those who were involved in the Normandy landings in 1944. 15 rectangular stone plinths, each inscribed with the words of a veteran, were placed below the last set of steps leading up to the Royal Hospital Chelsea. All around them was a carpet of 10,000 Armeria maritima plants (often called sea thrift), leading to a life-size stone carving (by Thomas Dagnall) of the recently deceased veteran, Bill Pendell. He looks across the path to an image of his 22-year old self, emerging from the beachhead, appearing in a ghostly form shaped by thousands of welded metal washers. It's not really a garden, nor is it art in a Turner Prize ""what's the new idea"" sense, but it is a moving monument that has a similar poignance to Paul Cummins' and Tom Piper's field of ceramic poppies. There is a blurred line between art and garden. Monet said he'd probably never have become an artist if it wasn't for gardens. Georgia O'Keeffe, the American artist, is another who made a garden that would inform her work at her home in Abiquiú, New Mexico, just as Frida Kahlo did in Mexico City. And so did the British sculptor Barbara Hepworth in St Ives, Cornwall. Of all the gardens on show at Chelsea this year, two could be read as either art or design. Sarah Eberle's The Resilience Garden, which was inspired by the Victorian horticulturist William Robinson, a passionate advocate of the wild garden (another theme running through this year's show), had something of Derek Jarman's famous Dungeness garden. The stony ground, the bald patches suggesting negative space; the faintly bleak atmosphere. Crucially, as with almost all the designs on display, it had something to say, which took it beyond its defined borders and into a relationship with the wider world. The concept behind the project was to highlight issues brought about by climate change and environmental damage. Diversity and experimentation are its central arguments. Wildflowers, woodland plants, and prickly pear cacti provide a stage from which hardy trees such as a monkey puzzle and ginkgo rise up to frame a centrally placed old grain silo. Once it was full of seeds, now it is full of ideas: an elevated office in which the designer's notebook lies open on a makeshift desk that sits below a ceiling of weaved willow by sculptor Tom Hare. My favourite was the The CAMFED Garden, designed by Jilayne Rickards. It came about after a research visit to Zimbabwe, and is the result of a subsequent collaboration between the designer and the inspirational local women she met on her trip. The colours are sensuous, the composition beautifully balanced. At the back, in the classroom, is a painting by a 14-year-old girl of a rural farmyard. It is exceptional. To see a traditional, tech-enhanced Zimbabwean garden is an unusual sight in central London at what is - in many ways - a traditional, tech-enhanced British garden show. But it strikes an important note, a reminder of the world in which we all live and rely: a window on to life in another continent in another hemisphere. It is sponsored by CAMFED - the Campaign for Female Education - whose focus is Africa. But on this occasion it is the well-heeled visitors to SW3 who are the beneficiaries of the organisation's mission to teach.","Last weekend the Duchess of Cambridge was splashed all over newspaper front pages swinging on a ball of rope like Miley Cyrus on her infamous wrecking ball, albeit wearing more clothes but with a similar taste in footwear."
"Benjamin Field, 28, and Martyn Smith, 32, are accused of planning the deaths of Peter Farquhar, 69, and Ann Moore-Martin, 83, in Buckinghamshire. Oxford Crown Court heard Mr Farquhar's whisky was ""supercharged"" and his food laced with hallucinogenic drugs. The accused deny charges of murder and conspiracy to murder. The court heard the accused ""psychologically manipulated"" the deeply religious pair who lived three doors from each other in the village of Maids Moreton in Buckinghamshire. Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, said the plot was a sustained campaign of so-called ""gaslighting"" - making them believe they were losing their sanity. Mr Farquhar, who taught part-time at the University of Buckingham, suffered night terrors and hallucinations and recorded this in a handwritten journal, Mr Saxby said. The barrister told the court the 69-year-old's drinks were topped up with bioethanol and poteen, a high strength Irish alcohol, and his food was laced with drugs. ""Peter Farquhar underwent various humiliations culminating in a doctor advising that all alcohol should be removed from his house and that he should abstain from drinking,"" the court was told. ""Peter Farquhar was not an alcoholic. Nor was he suffering from dementia, nor did he have any other form of disease of the mind.""

As well as meeting Mr Trump for the second time since he became PM in July, Mr Johnson is also due to hold one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine and Jordan. The PM, who is expected to be accompanied on the trip by his partner Carrie Symonds, said he had three priorities for the upcoming meeting. ""First, how Britain can work with our European and American allies on peace and stability in the Middle East,"" he said. ""Second, how science and new technologies can help the world deal with climate change and the threats to biodiversity. ""And third, how post-Brexit Britain will be a better place to invest in and live in.""","Climate change, instability in the Middle East and Brexit will be on the agenda when Boris Johnson meets other world leaders in New York next week."
"It is the first such admission he has made since becoming president in June, but echoes comments he made in 2015. He ran the southern city for two decades, earning a reputation for cutting crime, and criticism for allegedly supporting death squads. Mr Duterte was speaking to business leaders at the presidential palace on Monday, before an overseas trip. It is the latest in a series of controversial and sometimes contradictory comments by Mr Duterte. 'Blood on his hands' ""In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys [police] that if I can do it why can't you,"" he said. ""And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also. I was really looking for a confrontation so I could kill."" In 2015, he admitted killing at least three men suspected of kidnapping and rape in Davao. The comments have been condemned by human rights group Amnesty International, which has called on him to put an immediate end to the killings. ""The climate of impunity in the Philippines has intensified even further since President Duterte began his brutal crackdown on suspected drug users and dealers in July, with a wave of unlawful killings claiming more than 5,000 lives across the country,"" said Rafendi Djamin, the group's director for South East Asia and the Pacific. ""By boasting about the blood on his own hands, President Duterte will further embolden police and vigilantes to blatantly violate laws and carry out more extrajudicial executions without fear of being held to account."" But just hours before Mr Duterte's latest remarks, he insisted ""I am not a killer"", in a speech for The Outstanding Filipino Awards 2016. He has also previously both acknowledged and denied being involved with death squads. In September a Senate inquiry heard testimony from a self-confessed former death squad member that Mr Duterte had, while serving as Davao mayor, shot dead a justice department agent with an Uzi submachine gun. Nearly 6,000 people are said to have been killed by police, vigilantes and mercenaries since Mr Duterte launched his drug war after being elected in May. He has expressed few regrets about the policy, once saying: ""Hitler massacred three million Jews... There's three million drug addicts. I'd be happy to slaughter them."" Mr Duterte has repeatedly said he does not care about human rights and has suggested that lawyers defending drug suspects might also be targeted in his campaign, says the BBC's Jonathan Head. Some human rights lawyers believe the outspoken president's open support for a shoot-to-kill policy by the police could make him vulnerable to prosecution for crimes against humanity at the international court.",Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte has admitted he personally killed criminal suspects as mayor of Davao.
"Ms Dugdale told the BBC there had been a ""lot of internal problems"" in the party ahead of her sudden resignation. Her allies have claimed there was a ""plot"" against her after interim leader Alex Rowley was caught on tape backing leadership candidate Richard Leonard. The row unfolded as Jeremy Corbyn spoke at the Labour conference in Brighton. During his speech, Mr Corbyn said that Labour was ""on the way back in Scotland"", and thanked Ms Dugdale for her work. The dispute, which has involved several of the party's most prominent MSPs, has been thrown into the spotlight by the contest between Mr Leonard and Anas Sarwar to succeed Ms Dugdale as Scottish Labour leader. 'Internal problems' Ms Dugdale quit in August, with her deputy Mr Rowley subsequently revealing that he was only given ten minutes notice of the move. Speaking on BBC Radio Five Live, Ms Dugdale confirmed this was true, and added: ""I'm sure lots of people will be thinking, wow, that speaks to a lot of internal problems in the Labour party. They'd be right."" She also said she had quit as leader because ""it frees me up to talk about things I'm passionate about"", such as Brexit, noting that ""I wasn't able to do that as leader of the Scottish Labour Party, because at that point my job was to hold everybody together"". And she denied she had been pushed out of the role by opponents, saying: ""I wasn't bullied out of my position, I did this very much on my own terms"". However, Mr Rowley has faced accusations of being involved in a plot to replace Ms Dugdale with Mr Leonard - who like Mr Rowley is on the left of the party. The interim leader vowed not to endorse either candidate in the leadership race, but was caught on tape prior to a conference fringe event saying that Mr Leonard was ""the best candidate"". Mr Rowley was unaware he was being recorded, but the Scottish Sun quoted him as saying: ""Although I'm neutral in the leadership, I also believe that Richard Leonard has everything that we need to win in 2021. I really do. ""So when, to our surprise, the job became vacant, it just seemed to me that from a left perspective the person that was most suited to do that job would be Richard Leonard. 'Complete betrayal' Mr Rowley - whose daughter Danielle, a Labour MP, is running Mr Leonard's campaign - also said party figures ""privately didn't believe Kezia would be there"" for the next Holyrood election in 2021, saying that ""our view was that Richard was the best person and therefore we should go with that plan"". He also said he had been a backer of Mr Leonard ""for some time now"", but stressed that ""we certainly weren't putting any pressure on it"". His comments were described as ""hypocrisy"" and ""incredibly disappointing"" by fellow Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, a backer of Mr Sarwar - who is seen as being the centrist candidate and has been a critic of Jeremy Corbyn in the past. Ms Baillie said there was ""evidence of a plot going on behind the scenes for months"" against Ms Dugdale's leadership, calling this ""a complete betrayal of the membership and every value we hold dear"". She later told BBC Scotland: ""Richard Leonard may deny this, but there are people within his campaign team who have clearly been involved. I think Richard would want to distance himself from them."" This was echoed by another Sarwar-backing MSP, Daniel Johnson, who said that the ""admission of a plot is shocking and unacceptable"". However Ms Baillie's comments were in turn decried by Leonard-supporting MSP Neil Findlay as ""barrel-scraping desperation"". The party's MPs were also drawn into the row, with Martin Whitfield saying Mr Leonard had ""questions to answer"" over the affair, while Ms Rowley insisted that her father had ""always been very supportive"" of Ms Dugdale. A spokesman for Mr Leonard's campaign team said: ""If there were any attempts to undermine Kezia - they did not involve Richard and he knew nothing of them. Any statements that he did are completely false."" A Scottish Labour spokesman said: ""Alex was having what he believed to be a private conversation with a student and a political activist. He has not and will not publicly back a candidate. ""He has no intention of relinquishing his role as interim leader of the Labour Party in Scotland until after the current leadership contest is over."" 'Unifying message' Mr Sarwar's campaign has been dogged by controversy over his family's company, which saw him relinquish his shares after criticism from opponents including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The rival camps issued comments over the leadership row even as Mr Corbyn was making his keynote speech to the party's UK conference in Brighton. Mr Corbyn insisted Labour was ""on the way back in Scotland, becoming once again the champion of social justice"". He added: ""Thank you Kezia, and thank you Alex. And whoever next leads Scottish Labour - our unifying socialist message will continue to inspire both south and north of the border.""","A war of words has erupted at the top of Scottish Labour over claims of a ""plot"" to undermine former leader Kezia Dugdale."
"The Woldgate Woods landscape depicts trees near Bridlington, East Yorkshire. The piece, measuring 10.5ft (3m) wide, is made up of six individual canvases. Auctioneers Sotheby's said the sale had set a new record for the artist, breaking his previous auction record of $7.9m (£6.3m), set in 2009. The work had a guide price of between $9m and $12m. Grégoire Billault, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's, said: ""David Hockney stands alongside Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud as one of the pillars of post-war British art."" Hockney, who was born in Bradford, started painting the scenes at Woldgate, a Roman Road between Bridlington and Kilham, and Warter 10 years ago. His method of connecting multiple canvases to create one huge piece of artwork was devised because he was not able to fit the large-scale painting up the stairs of his Bridlington studio, Sotheby's said. The picture of Woldgate Woods was included in a Hockney exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 2012. A major retrospective of the artist's work is due to open at Tate Britain in February following his '82 Portraits and 1 Still-life' show at the Royal Academy earlier this year.",A painting by David Hockney has sold for $11.7m (£9.4m) at an auction in New York.
"The iconic crossing, which opened in 1911, has been closed for 16 months due to serious safety concerns. An internal audit found Middlesbrough Council needed to hold more regular inspections and there was a lack of qualified maintenance staff. The council's executive will consider approving £655,000 for urgent repairs. A council spokesman said the bridge is ""unusable for any purpose"" in its current state and the authority has already committed £377,000 to make the bridge safe, park the gondola and carry out inspections. A report for the executive, which meets on 22 December, said the cost to keep the Grade II-listed open as a visitor attraction would be about £4m over 10 years, but to reopen for traffic would cost £7m across the same period. Middlesbrough Mayor Andy Preston said: ""The Transporter Bridge is part of who we are and we will always preserve and protect this special part of Teesside. ""Exactly what role it will play for the next 100 years is a decision we should all consider together."" The bridge was closed in August 2019 after a safety inspection, with the previous such check carried out in 2011. Safety inspections should be carried out every six months, the council said, with an internal audit prompted by a whistleblower finding ""cause for considerable concern"". The audit, which will be presented to councillors on 17 December, identified a ""mostly passive and ineffective"" management approach to the bridge over the previous decade, It found a lack of ""specifically qualified or trained engineering staff"" ultimately led to the bridge deteriorating to the extent it presented a health and safety risk. There have been improvements since the bridge's management transferred from the Transport and Infrastructure department to Property and Commercial Services.

"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Thousands of excited fans - or jaded journalists - pack into grandiose events to be deafened by Coldplay or U2 and hear nervous executives read from an autocue that they are ""really excited"" to reveal a ""life-changing"" innovation that looks much like last year's model. And yes, there was a certain amount of that at the Samsung Unpacked event in Barcelona last night. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are what you would expect from the Korean company - extremely capable, state-of-the-art smartphones with excellent cameras. But these days half a dozen manufacturers can build a device we would have thought miraculous a few years ago, so a company like Samsung has to do more. And last night it did. The first clue was the Gear VR headset placed on each seat as we trooped into the vast hall. A voice from the sound system - in between snatches of Coldplay - explained patiently how to put it on. Then during the event we used the headset twice - once for the moment of the big reveal of the Galaxy S7, where a virtual box was opened, and more impressively to demonstrate Samsung's new 360 camera. Looking around at a Barcelona street scene with footballers playing keepy-up gave a glimpse of what users might do when they get their hands on the Gear 360 and share what they see on YouTube or Facebook. But it was the real coup de theatre which came next. As we removed our headsets, the most famous young man in the technology world appeared on the stage. Mark Zuckerberg is known to be an enthusiast for VR - after all he spent a chunk of Facebook's money buying Oculus Rift - but by appearing at a Samsung event and evangelising about its potential he gave a rocket-powered boost to his host's efforts in this field. He told us how he started sketching out what seemed an unlikely vision of virtual reality from the age of 11 (which young geek didn't?) but that it was now beginning to happen. ""VR is the next platform where anyone can experience anything they want,"" he said.""It's going to change the way we live and work and communicate."" He pictured sitting at a virtual campfire with friends around the world, watching a movie together, or sharing his baby's first steps with a 360 degree view. And of course this would become the future of social media, and Facebook - along with Samsung - would be at the heart of it. So, an event about a couple of new phones had become a kind of TED talk about a transformational technology. What a win for Samsung, still the world's leading smartphone maker but being squeezed by Apple at the high end and cheap but very capable Chinese smartphones at the budget end of the market. Like many others in this industry it is trying to look beyond smartphones for its growth, as profit margins get ever slimmer. Making money from its major investment in virtual reality will take time - the company is giving away a Gear VR headset to anyone who orders one of the new Galaxy S7 phones in advance. But, with the help of Facebook's founder, Samsung managed to change the conversation about the company last night and make itself look more far-sighted than many of its rivals.",It's easy to be cynical about phone launches.
"Mozambique national Tricamo Farid, 40, of Southport, Merseyside, was jailed for two years at Liverpool Crown Court after admitting fraud. The court heard he stole the card from a family friend in Lisbon in 1999 before travelling to the UK illegally. He then posed as an EU citizen in order to get a job and claim benefits. He was given a National Insurance number in 2001 after applying under the name of Dercio Quinta. 'Living a lie' Between 2002 and 2019, Farid claimed £121,177 in benefits from the Department of Work and Pensions and Sefton Council, the court heard. DWP fraud investigators and police also found a marriage certificate, a birth certificate for his child, a bank card and general paperwork all in the name of Mr Quinta at his home. Farid admitted 15 counts of fraud, three counts of acquiring criminal property, one count of dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit and one count of being knowingly concerned in fraudulent activity. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This is a serious and significant social security benefit and local authority fraud case. ""The benefits Farid claimed are urgently needed by many genuine claimants. Essentially, Farid has been living a lie for more than 18 years.""","A man who used a family friend's identity to enter the UK illegally before claiming more than £120,000 in benefits over 17 years has been jailed."
"Nathan Smith, who converted to Islam after moving to New Zealand 13 years ago, found the woman after he escaped over a wall at the Al Noor mosque. The father of three, originally from Poole in Dorset, said he wants to find her husband to know that he survived. Fifty people died and dozens were hurt in the attack at two mosques on Friday. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged with murder. Mr Smith, who has two daughters in New Zealand and a son who lives in the UK, described how the horror unfolded. At first, he thought he heard ""firecrackers"" or ""electrical problems"" going on outside as the Imam began speaking. ""Then, all of a sudden it was becoming louder and louder,"" he said. ""The windows started going out, I could see people just falling forward. People standing up and just falling."" He said those who were shot around him said ""Allahu Akbar"" as they fell to the ground. Mr Smith managed to escape through the back of the mosque and ran to his car - dialling the New Zealand emergency number 111. When the gunfire briefly stopped, he said one man, who often helped at the mosque, returned inside. He never came out. In the car park, Mr Smith saw survivor Farid Ahmed take shelter behind a car, but another worshipper was shot. When the firing started again and someone said the gunman was coming out, he escaped over a wall. ""I wasn't scared there was no time (to be) it was just reaction. I just went over,"" he said. He found a young woman lying in the road beside the mosque. He said: ""I can see she's been shot so I crouch down and try to roll her over."" He added: ""Now people are coming out of the Masjid (mosque) shouting and crying and people are being shot so I take my jersey off and I put it over this girl. ""I didn't know her name and I don't know where she's from at the time. I'm just holding her, I don't know why but I'm stroking her back - she's already dead."" He said he spent hours at a community centre in the hope of finding her husband. ""I was just hoping to catch a glimpse of her husband. I need to find him. I don't know his name. I just need to know he's okay. Friends who he had come to think of as ""second family"" were also killed, he said. Mr Smith has hardly slept since Friday, with memories of the victims, of the smells and sounds keeping him awake. ""The emotions just keep coming. You're okay for a few minutes or an hour and then it just comes back and you remember something that you didn't remember before. ""Fifty people dead. And the bodies were stacked on top of each other. People just falling. The windows going out. I can't explain it. ""How I got out I don't know. All my friend's dead and me not a scratch."" He said he feels ""proud"" of how New Zealanders have responded in the wake of the horror. ""People here have been good . They've looked after us,"" he said.

"The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the economy grew 0.8% in the last three months compared with a year ago. It is the best performance since July 2010, but NIESR attributed it to special events, including the Olympics. The economics research group said that the UK would return to its trend growth rate of 0.2%-0.3% in the coming months. The September output figure was flattered by the value of Olympic ticket sales, while the additional bank holiday for the Royal Wedding also reduced output in the comparable period a year ago, the NIESR said. Overall output remains almost 4% below its peak level in 2008, making this easily the worst performance by the UK economy since before the 1930s. The institute said that its early forecasts had a margin of error of 0.1-0.2 percentage points. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has significantly downgraded its own growth forecast for the UK. It now expects the economy to shrink by 0.4% this year. As recently as July it had been expecting positive growth of 0.2%. The Prime Minister David Cameron responded to the IMF report by saying that the UK economy was going through a ""slow and difficult healing process"" as it rebalances. ""We need more private sector growth, we need a smaller public sector, we need to make more, sell more overseas and manufacture more,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.","The UK economy's outlook remains ""weak"" despite experiencing a recent growth spurt, a respected think tank has said."
"Avijit Roy Avijit Roy was born to a Hindu family in 1972 in Bangladesh but had emigrated to the US. An engineer by profession, he set up his Bengali-language blog, Mukto-Mona (Free Mind) to promote secular and humanist writing in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. He was also the author of numerous books and magazine and journal articles - and had received death threats from Islamist radicals for his writings, according to his family. He courted controversy by not only championing atheism but also tacking issues such as homosexuality which he argued was inherent in man's nature. His approach upset many in conservative Bangladesh. He regularly returned to Bangladesh for the country's annual book fair in Dhaka, which is where he was killed in February.

"By Carys BetteleyBBC News The Welsh Government compiled a list of jobs deemed critical at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, which was provided to local authorities. However, some councils compiled their own lists which do not include jobs such as food workers and teachers. Teaching union Nasuwt said it was ""nonsensical"". Schools will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases, with childcare provided to vulnerable children and the children of key workers. According to the Welsh Government guidance, local authorities ""must have regard to the list"" when deciding who is a critical worker, but every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. The shop worker union Usdaw said it was crucial food workers should be able to access the childcare so stores can stay open, and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said childcare provision had become a ""postcode lottery"". While many councils confirmed to BBC Wales that they were following the Welsh Government's list, others said they did not define some of the roles included as essential. Ceredigion council's list only includes front-line workers for the care and health sector and blue light services - just two of the Welsh Government's list of seven groups. A spokeswoman said: ""In accordance to the guidance, Ceredigion has taken due regard of the Welsh Government list of critical workers."" Initially Carmarthenshire council included school staff but not food, utilities, communication or transport workers - but then reconsidered and now includes the Welsh Government's full list of critical workers. Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan included childcare and education staff - but not food, transport, utilities or council workers, or communication workers such as public service journalists providing Covid-19 coverage. A Bridgend council spokesman said: ""There are limited spaces available at schools due to the need to maintain small class bubbles, ensure teaching staff are able to continue to provide online learning for learners at home and cover for any staff sickness."" He added if it became possible to extend the support to more workers, the council would do so. Swansea, Gwynedd, Torfaen, Pembrokeshire, Newport, Flintshire, Anglesey, Monmouthshire, Powys, Caerphilly, Conwy, Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff all said they are following the Welsh Government's list of key workers in allocating childcare, with Cardiff and Merthyr prioritising the children of parents in NHS, blue light, education and social care if there were any shortages. Blaenau Gwent, Wrexham, Neath Port Talbot and Denbighshire councils did not provide details of their key worker provisions when asked by the BBC. Who does the Welsh Government class as key workers? Neil Butler, national official for Wales at teaching union Nasuwt, said: ""As front-line workers delivering an essential service, teachers and other school staff are classed as key workers. ""Schools are not closed during the lockdown, they remain open for a limited number of pupils and therefore many teachers and other school staff will still be required to attend their workplace during this time. ""If their own children are not allowed to attend their school many teachers and members of the school workforce will be left unable to provide this essential provision to the children of other key workers."" Mr Butler called on councils to ""immediately reconsider their position"". ""This decision by some councils is nonsensical and will undermine the ability of schools to continue to play their essential role in supporting the fight against Covid-19."" TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said: ""It's very concerning that some councils are not making provision of essential services like childcare available to the full list of critical workers. ""It isn't fair that just because someone works in a supermarket or a food processing plant, they could then face a postcode lottery in terms of whether then can access certain services. ""And when it comes to childcare and the groups of workers negatively impacted by this, lower-paid women workers are likely to be disadvantaged the most. This must be looked at again to make sure that there is a fair offer throughout Wales."" One teacher, who did not wish to be named, said she could not access key worker childcare due to her local council not counting her role as essential. ""People forget we have kids too,"" she said. ""We've been told teachers don't qualify for hub schools, but we have to give live online lessons. That's not possible with small children."" 'Crucial that food shops can remain open' Nick Ireland from shop worker union Usdaw said retail staff being recognised as key workers by the Welsh Government had been welcomed. ""That should be reflected in access to childcare while they are at work and there needs to be a consistent provision across the nation,"" he said. ""With schools closed to all but vulnerable and key workers' children, it is crucial that our members working in stores, retail distribution and delivery drivers are able to access childcare services so that food shops can remain open.""

Chancellor George Osborne and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi are also attending the forum.

""They also lose that social acceptability if they're viewed as not having integrity. If there's a series of scandals, there's a perception of ethical drift.

"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Unlike the animated 1992 original, the genie is the first name seen in the new cast list - which is understandable given that Will Smith is the biggest name in the project by some distance. Disney has opted for two relative newcomers for the roles of Aladdin and Jasmine - in the shape of Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott. It was reported at the time of casting in 2017 that around 2,000 actors and actresses had been reading for the two roles over several months. ""The casting process was intense,"" Massoud tells BBC News. ""I've been watching this film since I was a kid, and when I saw the audition notice I threw myself at it. ""And I didn't hear anything for four months, so I was a little disappointed, but I kind of moved on as any actor has to. ""Then when we heard back it was an intense [process], but I'm glad I'm here now."" Riz Ahmed and Dev Patel had been linked with the title role, but the longer it remained vacant, the more Disney began looking at fresher faces instead. ""Disney's magic carpet ride has hit a bit of turbulence,"" The Hollywood Reporter said at the time. ""Finding a male lead in his 20s who can act and sing has proven difficult - especially since the studio wants someone of Middle-Eastern or Indian descent (the animated film is set in the fictional Middle Eastern city of Agrabah). ""The search has dragged on, with Disney and [director Guy] Ritchie having to go back to the drawing board multiple times."" But the finished product has broadly gone down well with critics, if the first reviews are anything to go by. ""On the whole, Ritchie's adaptation wisely does little except add human flesh to the bare bones of what was always one of Disney's strongest stories,"" said Steve Rose in The Guardian. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent described it as ""a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect"". In a three-star review for Digital Spy, Ian Sandwell said it was an ""enjoyable retelling"", but was less keen on the ""overlong, drab and CGI-heavy finale"". Will Smith's portrayal of the genie has also defied the sceptics, with Ben Lawrence in The Telegraph saying he ""does a terrific job in bringing his own brand of manic chutzpah to the part"". ""Indeed Smith offers some much needed amplification to a film which (a third of the way through) is in danger of being lost in its over-prettified storytelling."" Massoud says ""there's a fine balance"" to be struck by studios when it comes to casting leading roles. ""I think we need to get to a point in the industry where we just cast the right person, the person that's right for the role,"" he says. ""Now, with so much content coming out in both television and film, I think a lot of actors are getting their shot at things more than before, but I think it just comes to casting the right person for the role."" 'Busting myths' Scott is surprised to learn just how many actors read for the parts of Jasmine and Aladdin, but adds she wasn't pinning all her hopes on being cast. ""I had a really strong idea of what I wanted to do with this character, which I think gave me peace. Because I was like, 'I'm going to put out there what I feel it could be or should be. ""And if that's what they want then great, but if it's not, then it's probably not for me anyway, you know?"" She also applauds any film studio willing to take a chance on hiring a newcomer for a role. ""It's really important to take risks when casting,"" she says. ""Also, just busting some myths about what makes money."" Interviewing Massoud and Scott is an interesting experience - as they have opposing personality types. Massoud is quiet and succinct with his answers. Scott is lively and energetic. Yet on screen, the pair have good chemistry and had to go through screen tests with each other before Disney made its final casting decisions. Both lead actors have other credits to their name - Scott was seen as Kimberly (the pink ranger) in 2017's The Power Rangers, for example. But this is the first time either of them have taken on a role of this scale. The attention has come thick and fast for Scott - who graced the cover of British Vogue last month. ""Naomi Scott will soon be one of Britain's brightest cultural exports,"" editor Edward Enninful predicted. 'Don't worry, I'm blue' The first time Massoud, Scott and Will Smith were seen in costume was in December, on the front cover of Entertainment Weekly. Fans were initially alarmed that Smith's genie wasn't blue - as Robin Williams's original animated character had been. But Smith soon used his Instagram account to reassure fans that, panic over, he was going to be blue. Check me rockin' the top knot ponytail vibes,"" he wrote, adding: ""And yes, I'm gonna be BLUE!"" ""This [magazine cover] is how the Genie is in human/disguise form. My character will be CGI most of the movie."" ""I think we live in an era now where social media and the internet, it's trial by Twitter, as they say,"" Massoud says. ""And everyone's entitled to that, that's fine, it's something that we as performers have to deal with, it's hard and it sucks sometimes but we have to deal with it. ""But having said that I think they'll be incredibly happy with this film, and I hope people love it, we certainly put our hearts and souls into it."" Smith arguably has the biggest weight of expectation, stepping into the intimidating role of the genie - made famous by the late and much-loved Robin Williams. ""I was terrified of that,"" Smith admits. ""Robin didn't leave much room for improvement in the genie. ""So the first thing I thought about was that it was going to be live action, so I knew that would give so many opportunities and that it would feel different. ""They captured something that was something for a generation. When you're marking people's childhoods. ""I wanted to create an homage to Robin and to the performance, with the songs and everything, that people would still connect, but then be able to add the new hip-hop flavour.""","You might think the lead character in Aladdin is... well, Aladdin. But not according to the end credits of Disney's new live-action remake."
"Prince George will be christened on Wednesday 23 October at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace - just over three months after his birth. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening. The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne. In a statement Kensington Palace said: ""Their royal highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to announce the christening of Prince George will take place on Wednesday, 23rd October at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. ""Prince George will be christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby."" BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the Chapel Royal was small and would only accommodate close family and a few others. In 1997 the coffin of Prince William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales, lay before the chapel's altar before her funeral in Westminster Abbey. Princess Beatrice was the last royal baby to be christened in the Chapel Royal in December 1988. Prince William was christened at Buckingham Palace in August 1982 by Dr Robert Runcie, then the Archbishop of Canterbury. The current Archbishop later spoke of his joy at being asked to conduct the christening. He said: 'I am delighted to be invited to conduct the baptism of His Royal Highness Prince George. ""It is a great privilege and honour and will without doubt be an occasion of immense joy and celebration. ""I am looking forward to welcoming him into the family of the church."" Prince George will be christened in a replica of the intricate lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The Earl and Countess of Wessex's son Viscount Severn became the first royal baby to wear the new robe at his christening in 2008. Earlier, Kensington Palace announced that a new coat of arms had been chosen to represent the duke and duchess as a married couple. The conjugal coat of arms, approved by the Queen earlier this year, features separate shields to represent the royal husband and wife.

"""My gran has been to every gig in Scotland,"" he says. ""She even came to Manchester on the last tour and I got 1,500 people to sing her Happy Birthday. ""It was incredible."" Walker told BBC Scotland that he moved from Glasgow to Cheshire when he was just three-and-a-half but his connections to his homeland remained strong. ""I grew up in a Glaswegian house because my parents are fairly Glaswegian sounding,"" he says. And he was often north of the border to visit his grandparents and cousins. His mum's family lived in Cumbernauld and his dad's in Kilsyth. ""When I was a kid it was like going on holiday,"" he says. ""I thought it was magic."" Walker, whose breakout hit Leave a Light On has been nominated for the Best British Single award, stays with his gran whenever he is in the west of Scotland. And he has written a song dedicated to her, called ""All that matters"". ""We sat one night and talked for four hours about everything she'd been through,"" he says. ""As a 27-year-old I'm like 'everything is hard for me, being young is so difficult'. ""But she's been through everything you can imagine and come out the other side a really happy and positive person. ""She's like a role model in that sense."" His gran Sadie told BBC Scotland she loved how he turned his experiences into beautiful songs and was ""absolutely chuffed"" he had written one about her. ""When he was up in Glasgow for TRNSMT last summer we were sitting one night and chatting. ""Two weeks later he phoned me up and said 'gran, I've written a song about you'."" She says Walker was a bit boisterous when he was younger but he is a ""gentle giant"" now. ""He's still the big cuddly bear he always was,"" she says. Walker himself says he is keen to avoid the pitfalls of stardom and be a positive influence like his gran. He says Leave a Light On was written because a friend was going through a really tough time with drug and alcohol issues and it was a way of processing it. But many people have told him it helped them cope with their own problems. ""I always write music if I'm feeling a bit rubbish and I don't know how to get over or through something,"" he says. ""It's like therapy I guess and it is a really nice side effect that people find their own stories in those songs and it helps them get through stuff. ""I set out to make music people enjoy but it is really cool that it is helping people get through."" As well as the best single nomination, Walker is also up for best British Breakthrough Act. He says it was ""crazy"" to find out he was nominated for two Brits. ""My friends think I'm actual proper artist now,"" he says. ""My parents think I've got an actual proper job."" He is not sure who he will be taking with him to the awards ceremony at London's O2 arena on 20 February but he says it would be great for his gran to be there. Sadie was at Murrayfield at the weekend when Walker performed his biggest hit on the pitch before the rugby international between Scotland and Italy. After performing he stayed on the pitch for the national anthem. ""Standing in the middle of that field was ridiculous,"" he says. ""When the Scots national anthem came on they did an instrumental for the first half and then they stopped and everybody around the whole stadium finished it off. ""That was such a moment, 67,000 people all singing it and you are in the middle. ""I just kept spinning around with my mouth wide open thinking 'this is amazing'."" Walker was joined for his performance by Scottish act the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, who he had also performed with during a warm-up busking session on the steps of Glasgow's Buchanan Street last week. They will also appear with him at BBC Scotland's Quay Sessions, which will be broadcast on 14 February on Radio Scotland. Walker says he really enjoyed the experience and would love to work with the pipers again but there is one Scottish artist above all others that he would like to meet - Paolo Nutini. ""I've always loved everything he's done,"" Walker says. ""He's got such a cool voice. He seems like an interesting character."" Nutini is not nominated for a Brit award this year but fellow Scottish megastar Calvin Harris is up against Walker in the Best Single category. ""He's got enough Brits surely,"" Walker says. Whether he wins or not, Walker will be busy for the rest of the year, with his debut album ""What a time to be alive"" out on 1 March and tour dates planned around the world. And no doubt his gran Sadie will be at Glasgow's Barrowland when he returns to his homeland on 26 April.",Brit award nominee Tom Walker has made a big impact on the music world in the past year but his number one fan is his 81-year-old granny.
"Cleveland Fire Brigade said it received repeated ""entrapment calls"" to the blaze in Hemlington in Middlesbrough in the early hours of Monday. When they arrived they were ambushed, leaving a fire engine damaged. Fire chiefs described the attacks as ""completely unacceptable"". Cleveland Police officers were also targeted during the fracas. An investigation is under way. The brigade's senior area manager Steve Johnson said it would not tolerate such attacks. ""It is completely unacceptable for our staff to be subject to violence and acts of vandalism whilst protecting the public. ""Our job is made even more difficult by the thoughtless actions of a minority who in this instance, deliberately set fires and damaged a fire engine, making that vehicle unavailable for emergency response. ""Deliberate fires such as these divert resources and run the risk of us not being able to respond to a life threatening incident."" A police spokeswoman said they received reports of a ""large group"" causing damage to properties and vehicles and burning items in the Cass House Road area. The brigade said it had seen 13 attacks on crews between March and May, including a tree trunk being thrown through the windscreen of a fire engine and bricks hurled at firefighters as they tackled a garden fire that was threatening to spread.

"Nearly 200,000 more people were in the centre this year compared to last, taking the total to nearly nine million - 1.5 million more than predicted. It comes despite fears that shoppers would leave the city because some high street names have closed stores. Experts say the rise could be due to new homes, offices and a university campus being built in the area. According to the council's service plan indicators and targets, footfall for Newport city centre stood at 8,939,472 in the year 2011/2012. That is a rise of 192,638 on the year 2010/2011 and 1,504,633 more than the council predicted for 2011/2012. It follows figures from the National High Street Index which show a 7.6% rise in the number of people in Newport City Centre this June compared to last. According to this study Cardiff saw a 1.6% drop - and Swansea a 4.5% drop. James Urquhart, the co-owner of Total Toys, has moved from a stall in the city's indoor market to a bigger shop on the high street because of the rise in footfall. ""We're seeing a bit of an increase because we're seeing more shops re-opening,"" he said. ""One of the people down town, called Missy, he shut for a while but now he's back. Obviously for him to come back there must be an increase - he was talking about going to Cwmbran, but he's come back to Newport as well"". 'City landscape changing' It is difficult to pinpoint any one reason for the rise in footfall, but some experts believe it may, in part, be down to new housing in the centre, professional services relocating to the city and the new University of Wales Newport campus on the banks of the River Usk. Dr Jonathan Deacon, a reader in Marketing and Entrepreneurship at the University of Wales Newport says the city landscape is changing. He said: ""We have to rethink and redesign what our city centres are all about - and the city centre of Newport has taken a brave step in saying that maybe it's not just about retail, that it's not just about office space - it's about this kind of mixed activity, so dwelling spaces as well as commercial spaces"". The rise in footfall comes after fears that Newport was losing shoppers to other shopping centres in nearby Cardiff and Bristol, along with Cwmbran, where there is an out-of-town retail park. Big high street names, including Marks and Spencer, Next, Burton and Topshop, all shut stores in the city centre last year. But in March it was announced that plans to revamp Newport's shopping centre with the Friars Walk development for John Frost Square had been approved. Work is likely to start on the £100m development next year to create a new shopping centre and a department store, along with a six-screen cinema, eight restaurants and cafe. A car park with 360 spaces is included in the plan.","The number of people passing through Newport city centre has risen ""significantly,"" council figures show."
"In the past year staffing levels have already been cut by 99, but Treasury Minister Anne Craine said 285 more posts will go. There are currently more than 8,000 government employees on the island - about 10% of the population. Mrs Craine said: ""We can't rule out redundancies."" 'More efficient' She added: ""We will look at posts which have been lying unfilled for some time and those posts will be getting close examination to see if they are absolutely necessary. ""When people retire, their job will not automatically be re-filled because we are looking to see where savings can be made in delivering our service in a more efficient way"". Anne Craine also warned that the days of inflation-matching salary increases in government were now over. In the Isle of Man Budget 2011 the government has announced savings of £25m by cutting government spending in each department, except for Health. The Treasury department has been the worst affected with a reduction of 7%, while the Health department has seen a rise in spending of 6.5%. Home Affairs spending has been reduced by £2.25m to £32m and Environment Food and Agriculture faces cuts of 6.3% to just over £15m. The standard rate of income tax (10%) and higher rate (20%) remain the same. 'Very fortunate position' As well as the cuts, the government has announced a 7.7% increase in Personal Allowance Credit, a benefit paid to about 11,000 people each year. Mrs Craine said: ""We are trying to protect those on lower incomes, that will be at the expense of those on higher incomes. ""The story behind this budget is that we are doing very well but we are not out of the woods yet. ""We are in a very fortunate position with a strong economy, low levels of unemployment and a business sector which is thriving and a diversified economy."" Tax Changes The Isle of Man government has also announced the abolition of the attribution regime for individuals (ARI) in an attempt to end concerns over zero-ten. ARI is a tax anti-avoidance system which the European Union is likely to identify as 'harmful' in its monitoring of the island's tax regime. European finance ministers (ECOFIN) have been examining the effects of the island's Zero-Ten tax regime. Zero-ten means some companies pay no corporation tax and others 10%. The attractive rates have attracted business from all over the world including companies involved in e-gaming and the space industry but local companies are unable to benefit in the same way as off-shore business. By withdrawing ARI it is hoped the EU working group will be more likely to view the island's current tax regime favourably.","Hundreds of civil servant posts are to be cut as part of a five-year plan to ""re-balance"" the finances of the Isle of Man government."
"In an unconventional move, the firm will list shares directly on the NYSE. Rather than issue new shares, Spotify's existing shareholders will take their shares directly to the market. That will allow early investors and employees to sell their stakes and is not intended to raise new funding. Mark Mulligan, a UK-based music industry analyst at MIDiA Research, said: ""It's about a company that is letting its investors get their returns so it can move on to the next stage of its career."" Spotify has offered a streaming service since 2008 and has 159 million monthly active users including 71 million paid subscribers globally. Apple Music has about 36 million subscribers, but unlike Spotify it does not offer a free tier supported by advertising. What Spotify must do to survive How bands are escaping the music industry snake pit Analysis: North America technology reporter Dave Lee The fact that Spotify exists at all is something of a minor miracle: unknown Swedish company convinces major record labels to upload millions upon millions of songs for people to listen to without buying them. It must have been quite the pitch. Sure, the labels get royalties but it's pennies - fractions of pennies - on what they used to get from ""traditional"" online sales. Regardless, it's been clear for a long time that streaming is the music industry's future. On Wednesday, Spotify announced it would go public - but that's not to say it is here to stay. The company has long been surrounded by threats, and it's no different today. Apple, Amazon and Google are also in the streaming game and - unlike Spotify - all sell devices on which consumers can listen to music. And while Spotify has signed deals with all the ""big three"" record labels - Warner, Universal and Sony - it's the music executives that still hold the bargaining chips. Read more from Dave Lee here Calculating value Spotify said its shares sold for between $37.50 and $125 each in private transactions last year and more than $132 this year. The company's potential valuation is based on a combination of stock price and how many shares it has outstanding. The prices shared by Spotify suggest a range of $6.3bn to more than $23bn. The higher figure would make Spotify one of the biggest public debuts of a tech company since 2012, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and manages exchange traded funds focused on new public companies. She cautioned, however, that private investors have tended to value firms more highly than public markets in recent years. Snap, owner of Snapchat, for example also had an almost $30bn market capitalisation after its first day of trading last year, but it has struggled to sustain that figure. ""This could be an issue - could it possibly sustain those valuations?"" she said. In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Spotify said it has made annual losses every year and lost more than €1.2bn in losses in 2017. However, revenues rose almost 40% to €4bn last year, according to the filing. Europe is its largest region, with 58 million monthly active users, followed by North America. It is also making inroads in Latin America and other parts of the world. Churn rates, which measure cancellation, have fallen, while the time spent using the service has increased. ""All of that stuff paint a really strong story to investors that they're on the right path,"" Mr Mulligan said. Future plans In its filing, Spotify says it aims to ""unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators."" The firm said it had paid more than €8bn in royalties to artists, music labels, and publishers since its launch. The filing also hinted at plans to expand beyond music into other forms of radio. ""With our ad-supported service, we believe there is a large opportunity to grow users and gain market share from traditional terrestrial radio,"" it said.",Spotify has filed to list on the New York Stock Exchange in a move that may value the world's biggest music streaming service at more than $23bn (£16.7bn).
"Tom Dolphin, of the British Medical Association, told the Junior Doctors Conference that students paying £9,000 tuition fees will have debts of up to £70,000 by the time they start working. He urged delegates to fight government plans to change the NHS pension scheme. Health minister Simon Burns said pension reform was ""necessary"". Ballot papers are being sent to 103,000 BMA members. It is the first time doctors have been balloted for industrial action since 1975. 'Not much cheer' The government says the plans, under which the pension age would rise to 68, and contributions could reach 14.5% for the highest earners, are a ""fair deal for staff and taxpayers"". The result of the vote on pension changes is due at the end of the month. Dr Dolphin, chairman of the BMA's Junior Doctor Committee, said: ""At the moment, it is genuinely hard to find much cause for cheer."" Addressing the conference in central London, he said: ""We need to put up a fight. Imagine for a moment you were applying for a place at medical school right now. With £9,000 tuition fees you will be facing debts on graduation of up to £70,000. ""When you start working, a big chunk of your salary will be used to repay these debts. With salaries frozen for many years, your starting salary will have been eroded by inflation. ""And on top of that you will be faced with increased pension contributions."" He added: ""The burden of austerity is falling too hard on the shoulders of the younger generation and we are seeing this in medicine, too. ""With a future like this, will medicine still be able to attract and retain some of the most talented young people? Would you still make the choice to study medicine?"" 'Fair' deal Doctors at the start of their careers would be hardest hit, having to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds extra - double what they would have paid - in lifetime pensions contributions, according to the BMA. Dr Dolphin said: ""The government wants us to pay more and work longer for what will probably be a worse pension. ""The extra contributions add up to more than £200,000 for many junior doctors."" Health Minister Simon Burns said there was ""no justification"" for doctors to take industrial action and that it would ""gain them nothing"". ""Our proposals mean doctors will continue to receive pensions that are among the highest in the public or private sectors,"" he said. ""A doctor joining the new scheme after 2015 could expect a pension of around £68,000 per year at state retirement age."" ""Pension reform is necessary because people are living longer, healthier lives. ""Our proposals are a fair deal for staff and taxpayers and make public service pensions affordable and sustainable."" He added: ""It is fair that higher earners pay greater contributions relative to those on lower and middle incomes. ""Lower earner members should not be footing the bill - that is why we have protected those on lower salaries.""","The prospect of high student debt and increased pension contributions could discourage young people from entering medicine, a doctor has warned."
"The Lancashire County Council (LCC) and Preston Youth Zone (PYZ) plans include a sports hall, arts facilities as well as 36 new bus bays in the station. The plan has been put forward after the station was protected from demolition by English Heritage last year. A planning application will be submitted for consideration next April. LCC and PYZ are funding the project with £7.4m being allocated to the bus station, £6m for the Youth Zone Plus and the remainder for repair and highway improvement costs. Lancashire 'asset' English Heritage said the Grade II listing would not prevent changes being made to the building, provided its architectural significance was protected.

"Jean-Baptiste Colbert helped write the Code Noir or Black Code in the 17th Century which defined slavery and race in France's colonial empire. Footage posted on social media shows the activist spraying Colbert's statue with red paint on Tuesday. He sprayed the words ""state negrophobia"" at the base of the monument before police detained him. The group Brigade Anti Négrophobie posted the video and the man is himself wearing a shirt bearing their name. French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye criticised the graffiti, saying people should consider ""the historical facts as they unfolded"". ""I feel it's more useful to use the context in which historical figures made decisions,"" she told reporters at her weekly press briefing, saying people should not forget everything Colbert did, though adding that the Code Noir was ""indeed an important subject"". The alleged murder of George Floyd by US police in the city of Minneapolis last month has prompted a wave of demonstrations worldwide against police brutality and institutional racism. Statues of racist or slave-owning historical figures have also been targeted. In France there have been mass protests over the death of Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old killed in police custody in 2016. Demonstrators have likened his death to that of George Floyd. This is not the first French statue to be vandalised in recent weeks. In the northern city of Lille, protesters wrote the words ""murderer"" and ""colonist"" on the statue of Louis Faidherbe, a 19th Century governor of Senegal when it was a French colony. Who was Jean-Baptiste Colbert? Colbert was a French statesman who served King Louis XIV during the 17th Century. He earned the nickname ""The Great Colbert"" for economic reforms he put in place as France expanded its colonial empire overseas. In the 1680s, he helped write the Code Noir on the orders of the king. It set out a number of regulations for French colonies in the Americas and the Caribbean, including banning Jewish people from all France's colonies, defining how slavery would work, and restricting the freedoms of free black people. As protests have spread in France in recent weeks Colbert has become an increasingly controversial figure. Colbert's statue sits outside the French parliament, the National Assembly. There is also a building inside named Colbert Hall, and other structures around the country bearing his name. Jean-Marc Ayrault, former prime minister and the president of France's Foundation for the Remembrance of Slavery in Nantes, has called for Colbert Hall to be renamed. ""The time has come for France to take a new step concerning the question of colonisation and slavery,"" he told the Ouest France newspaper. ""I am not saying that we dismantle all the statues, for example, but that we affix a plaque recalling who Colbert is and what he did,"" Mr Ayrault said. President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this month that France ""will forget none of its artworks, it won't take down statues"" in the wake of the protests. ""I will be very clear tonight, compatriots: the Republic won't erase any name from its history,"" he said in a televised address. Statues have been defaced and toppled across Europe in recent weeks, including in Belgium and the UK.",An activist has vandalised the statue of a French statesman outside the country's parliament.
"An estimated £100m is needed to make improvements to the trunk road, which links east and west Sussex. The road, from Pevensey to Portsmouth, is the only major east-west road on the south coast, An announcement on whether funding will be made available is expected in the chancellor's Autumn Statement on 3 December. West Sussex County Council said the A27 was ""one of the most unreliable trunk roads in England"". ""This unreliability affects the local economy as it causes delays for businesses, residents and visitors to West Sussex,"" a spokesman said. Local campaigners took Transport Minister John Hayes to see one of the worst black spots on Thursday. The Conservative visited Pevensey, East Sussex, where the A27 takes over from the A259. He said: ""It's something we're looking at as a department, we have a feasibility study looking at what could be done to improve things. ""You can make decisions in Westminster and Whitehall, but actually getting a look and feel of what the effect of those decisions is going to be, is vitally important.""",A feasibility study is being carried out on how to reduce bottlenecks on the often heavily-congested A27.
"But the ordained priesthood will still be the preserve of men, he stressed in the decree. It is official recognition of roles already performed by women in some Catholic services, especially in Western countries. The Pope said women were making a ""precious contribution"" to the Church. The announcement is expected to force conservative Church leaders to accept greater involvement of women in the liturgy. On the more reformist wing of the Church, Pope Francis has tried to present a more welcoming image through his rhetoric, the BBC's Mark Lowen reports from Rome. But last year, after a synod to decide whether to allow women to become deacons able to preside over some Church services, the Pope refused to make the change, frustrating some who had hoped for more fundamental reform during his pontificate. The Pope changed a clause in canon law from ""lay men"" to ""lay persons"", specifying that they can perform ""the ministries of lector and acolyte"" in Catholic services. His decree, called a Spiritus Domini, was accompanied by a letter explaining ""the urgency... to rediscover the co-responsibility of all of the baptised in the Church, and the mission of the laity in a particular way"". A lector in the Catholic Church can recite prayers and sacred texts such as psalms during Mass and other services, but gospel readings are done by the priest or deacon. An acolyte assists the priest or deacon at the altar and can distribute the Eucharist - the bread and wine - during Mass.

"By Vikas Pandey & Andrey VladovBBC Monitoring It was the mid-1800s in southeast England, and a little boy was being beaten by his mother for drinking the last of the water in their house during a drought. Thousands of miles away in India, the story was narrated by Edward Anderdon Reade, acting governor general of the United Provinces, to the Maharajah of Benares (now Varanasi) at the latter's palace over dinner. Moved by the story from the Chiltern Hills, the Maharajah agreed to fund the sinking of a well in the village of Stoke Row, still recognisable today by the golden elephant that adorns it. The construction, known as the Maharajah's Well, was the first of several in the region. All were funded by royals and other benefactors from India, inspired by the Maharajah of Benares's example. ""This well is highly unusual because of its funder and history,"" explains Angela Spencer-Harper, author of Dipping into the Wells. ""At a time when the British Empire was spreading all over the world, this generosity by the maharajah sparked a trend among India's wealthy people to fund wells in the UK. But this one in Stoke Row is the first and will always remain special."" The well's 368ft (112m) depth is equal to St Paul's Cathedral. Two workers dug it by hand, by turns scooping out earth and laying bricks. Its 4ft diameter proved an extremely tight workplace, and the workers faced danger because of bands of sand between layers of chalk 150ft below the surface, which tended to cave inwards. ""They kept digging, even during the winter. It must have been terrible conditions to work in the dark,"" says Spencer-Harper. A year later, the digging was done. Visitors to the Chiltern hills can now see the well's 23ft superstructure topped off by a bright dome. Not content with a simple well, the maharajah also funded the winding machinery and a decorative golden elephant that still stands sentinel. Officially opened on 24 May 1864, the well cost £353. For comparison, a cottage for the caretaker - built alongside - cost £74 14s 6d. Some local residents were unimpressed with the expenditure on the grand well. According to An Illustrated History Of The Maharajah's Well by Laureen D Williamson, the bright colours and and lavish construction upset some who believed the poor community was spending a little too much. The well served its purpose for 70 years, with the maharajah also financing a four-acre cherry orchard. The generosity of Reade, born into the Oxfordshire gentry, was being returned. One of his many deeds when he worked for the maharajah in India was to sink a well in 1831 for the local community. ""For the rest of his life, the maharajah continued to pay for the maintenance of the well and also paid to look after the villagers during times of crises,"" says Spencer-Harper. ""He had a special bond with the people although he never visited the area. I guess people would have given him an imperial reception if he ever came to the village."" At the maharajah's behest, additions and modifications were inaugurated or commenced on special occasions. A footpath was completed at the maharajah's expense when the Marquis of Lorne married Princess Louise in 1871. In 1882, when Queen Victoria survived an assassination attempt, he funded a ration of free bread, tea or sugar, as well as lunch for the villagers. Reade's death in 1886 started the decline of the well, and the arrival of a reliable pipeline in 1927 sealed its fate. Use declined and it fell into disrepair. In 1961, the then Maharajah of Benares mentioned the forthcoming centenary of the well to Queen Elizabeth on her visit to the Indian city. Nearly 1,500 people attended the celebrations in Stoke Row on 8 April 1964, with Prince Philip among them. The relationship with India was commemorated with water from the holy river Ganges being ceremonially poured into the well. ""The well certainly changed the way people lived in the area,"" says Spencer-Harper. ""The area and village of Stoke Row had no natural water resource and people would drink from puddles, causing them diseases. ""Many new houses were built around the well and people got more work. Even a brick factory was started after the well."" And those with an interest in the history of the well are already looking forward to the 150th anniversary in 2014.

"Halesworth-based Air Artists is selling 30 years' of its work, used by the likes of the Rolling Stones and AC/DC. The star lot is Algie, which famously halted flights over Heathrow after breaking loose from its moorings over Battersea Power Station in 1976. Creator Rob Harries said: ""It's time for someone else to take them for a walk."" The inflatables were cleared out from the workshop after Mr Harries decided on a change in creative direction and began working with clay. But the auctioneers selling the props on 15 September say they ""really don't know"" how much the lots will make because they are so unusual. When Mr Harries saw just how many items had been lying on the shelves for years, he decided they should go under the hammer. He said: ""I'm sad to see them go but they very rarely see the light of day and so I would be quite happy for someone else to take them for a walk. ""The clear-out has been quite cathartic and brought back a lot of memories, but I do feel I've been there and done that now, and it's time to move on."" His favourite item is the pig's head from Roger Waters' Berlin Wall concert, produced back in 1990, but he has produced a wealth of items, including work for the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, and Bon Jovi. The inflatables were made in plain white fabric, stitched by his partner, Shirley, and then painted by a colleague, Andy Ireland. Most of his work came through a late friend, the rock and roll stage designer Mark Fisher. Dominic Parravani, for auctioneers Durrants, said: ""It seems amazing to me that iconic props that have been seen by millions of people from all around the world have been designed and produced just down the road from here in Halesworth.""","Iconic inflatable stage props - including Pink Floyd's famous pig ""Algie"" - are to be sold at auction."
"Six Catholic men were killed after gunmen opened fire in a County Down bar in June 1994. They were watching Ireland play Italy at the time. UEFA agreed after an approach by the FAI on behalf of the families. Ireland's match against Italy in Euro 2012 will fall exactly 18 years to the day since the tragedy occurred. The FAI said it was ""particularly poignant"" because the shootings happened while the victims were watching Ireland vs Italy during World Cup USA. FAI chief executive John Delaney was in America following the Irish team when he heard about the killings. ""What happened in Loughinisland in 1994 was an awful tragedy and deeply moving for all football fans,"" he said. ""I would like to thank UEFA for assisting us in commemorating this atrocity and take the opportunity to remember all those who lost their lives in the Troubles."" Tragedy He said it was ""proper"" that the team should wear the armbands. ""It's a poignant remembrance of what was a horrific tragedy as were many, many other tragedies in Northern Ireland on both sides of the community. ""It was more that the Irish team recognised this particular one as important given the significance of the date and the team that we're playing."" Mr Delaney said he would be meeting some of the players on Thursday to tell them the ""reason and the rationale"" of why the FAI was doing this. ""Our players have a great understanding of history and tradition and they've always been very respectful of tradition,"" he said. ""They'll be very understanding of the difficult occasion and the difficult memories for people, the families, of what happened 18 years ago."" Niall Murphy, solicitor acting for the families said: ""The families are touched that this tragic event can be commemorated on such a poignant day, the eighteenth anniversary of the atrocity. ""We would like to thank the FAI and UEFA for their assistance in providing a forum to recall the awful events that took place on that fateful day when Ireland played Italy in 1994."" On 18 June 1994, the rural pub was busy with people watching the match when just after 2200 BST, two UVF members walked in and fired indiscriminately. Civilians The six men who died were Adrian Rogan 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Greene, 87, Daniel McCreanor 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. All were Catholic civilians. Mr Greene was one of the oldest people to be killed in the Northern Ireland Troubles. Sixteen people have been arrested in connection with the attack but no-one has ever been convicted. The families of six men murdered in the Loughinisland massacre are taking legal action following a Police Ombudsman's report into the killings. The report found insufficient evidence of security force collusion in the 1994 attack by loyalists. Victims' relatives are seeking to have Police Ombudsman Al Hutchinson's findings' quashed. Lawyers for the families claim the conclusions reached are flawed.",The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) has said its players will wear black armbands during the Italy match at Euro 2012 to mark the 18th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.
"Being intubated and ventilated in intensive care turns out to be a long, rocky road. In Bradford, of the 49 Covid patients who have been admitted to our ICU so far, most have been placed on intubated ventilators. So far seven of these patients have come off ventilation. Mohammed Hussain, a criminal lawyer from Bradford, was one of the first. He is one of our success stories. The 51-year-old was unconscious for five weeks and was very disconcerted when he woke up in what looked like a science fiction film with everybody wearing visors and masks and gowns - he couldn't remember how he got there. He had entirely missed the month of April. ""I remember them asking me to go on the Recovery trial to try certain drugs and I said 'Yes.' But that's my last memory until I was waking up weeks later,"" Mohammed told me. While under sedation, he dreamed that his family had experienced a terrorist attack. And when he came round he remained uneasy. ""There was some paranoia to begin with. I thought, 'These people are trying to trick me. What's going on, what's all this about?'"" This kind of delirium is quite normal for patients who wake up from critical care, says ICU consultant Dr Debbie Horner, clinical director for the anaesthetics and intensive care department. ""It's common for patients to feel very suspicious and anxious about what's going on around them. You can understand it, people are telling you that it's more than a month later and everyone's wearing really strange clothes."" Usually it's possible to give people advance warning before they get intubated, but Mohammed deteriorated quickly. He fell ill in March, following the funeral of his father, Noor, who was in his 90s. Noor Hussain had come over from Pakistan in the 1960s to work in the mills in Bradford. He raised his family here, but it was always his wish to be buried in Mirpur. ""He was an old soldier who fought in the Second World War, in Burma, and he was a very determined man. He wanted to be buried next to his brother in Pakistan and I honoured that wish for him,"" Mohammed told me. Noor Hussain died on 10 March. The funeral gathering started that afternoon. It is a very large and respected family, so people travelled from across the UK - about 600 came to pay tribute at Bradford's Grand Mosque on the first day. The following day Mohammed flew to Pakistan with his father's body - his mum and his wife went with him. But back in Bradford, the funeral continued for another two days. On Thursday 12 March, 500 mourners came and shared a meal. About a week later, people began to fall ill with Covid-19. The first was Mohammed's cousin's 24-year-old son - one of the first Covid patients in Bradford to be admitted to ICU. Three further members of that household also developed symptoms, one of them also going to hospital. And other relatives were hospitalised too, both in Bradford and Oldham. It seems clear that someone at the funeral - possibly one of the mourners from Bradford, possibly one of the visitors from further afield - was infected with the coronavirus and that many people contracted it there. ""If you start looking at the number of cases that have come from that funeral, it's easy to see how quickly it spread,"" says Mohammed's son, Haroon, a radiologist. ""At the funeral you shake each other's hand and talk to people, you're very close. ""The country went into lockdown shortly after, and the reports are coming out now that coronavirus was in the population for a significant period of time before we realised. So if you've got a gathering of people, it increases the chances that maybe one of them has it."" Haroon can list eight family members who were hospitalised and three who died. We have seen other patients who became ill after funerals and family gatherings in this same period, just before the lockdown. It's the close physical contact - hugging and shaking hands - that seems to create such a high rate of transmission. For the same reason, weddings and parties are also super-spreading events. By the time Mohammed returned home from Pakistan on 18 March, Haroon and his brother, who live with their parents, had symptoms too. ""We tried to distance ourselves,"" says Haroon. ""But when you're living in one household that's nigh-on impossible - there's only a certain number of bathrooms, there's only one fridge, one kitchen."" Mohammed was concerned about catching the virus because he is asthmatic, but that Saturday he developed symptoms. He stayed home for nine days, getting progressively worse, until his sons called 999. ""We walked him into the ambulance,"" says Haroon. ""That was a very emotional moment as we couldn't go with him and we didn't know when we would see him again."" When Mohammed arrived at Bradford Royal Infirmary, he saw his uncle in the waiting room, also wearing an oxygen mask. Sadly, he has since died. Front line diary Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Mohammed was intubated and put on a ventilator. ""During that time, people are deeply sedated and their muscles are paralysed with medicines to allow the oxygen to get into the body,"" says Debbie Horner. Twice a day, Mohammed was proned, turned from front to back, to try and get as much oxygen into his body as possible by stimulating different bits of the lungs. This was done by a team of radiologists who volunteer to do this - they call themselves the Ratters - the Radiology Turning Team. At the start of this crisis, Covid-19 was thought to be primarily a lung disease where the life-saving treatment would be intubated ventilation, with patients sedated in intensive care. As the weeks have passed, clinicians have increasingly turned to less invasive ventilators called CPAP machines, which blow oxygen into the lungs, keeping them inflated - at Bradford we were using them from an early stage of the epidemic and putting patients on them at an earlier stage of their illness than some other hospitals. Predictions in March were that 30% of patients would be on ventilators in intensive care units. As it's turned out, it's less than 20% nationally and less than 10% in Bradford, suggesting that this early and less invasive treatment is effective. ""I genuinely believe we've managed to pitch it right here,"" says Dr Tom Lawton, a consultant in critical care. ""By using simple machines that are designed to make it all as easy as possible, and having brilliant staff that are prepared to jump in and do everything - even care that they're not used to delivering in that kind of environment - we haven't brought as many people to intensive care as we thought we would. And yet, our patients don't seem to have suffered as a result."" Preliminary data shows the death rate of Bradford Royal Infirmary is 23%, that's lower than national figures. However in ICU the death rate is 50%, in line with other ICU rates. Once out of intensive care, Mohammed Hussain began a slow process of rehabilitation on a stroke ward. His shoulder was damaged during proning and he needed additional physio - he couldn't move his right arm much and so it was difficult for him to feed himself. He is full of gratitude. ""Believe me, the people who work in ICU, in this crisis, putting themselves at risk, they are the most amazing people,"" he says. ""It's not just the medical treatment, but it's the human touch. It's the depth of the conversations, the genuine interest and how you develop relationships. It contributes massively towards you getting better. ""I remember when I was first taken upstairs on the ward, this poor doctor was running various tests and he went to get me a drink - he brought me pineapple juice. It was like a drink from heaven. ""Sometimes the enormity of what we've been through affects me and makes me emotional."" During the five weeks that his dad was unconscious, Haroon kept everyone updated via Whatsapp. ""There were so many people worried about him,"" he says. ""My dad is incredibly well-known in the community and the messages were going to hundreds of people throughout the world. Everywhere you go, you meet people who my dad has helped."" Looking through the replies from his hospital bed, Mohammed spotted a theme: ""Oh, he's too stubborn, he's too tough, he'll be all right…"" ""I didn't know that's how I was viewed by people,"" he says. But Haroon isn't having it. ""You did know that, that's a lie!"" Mohammed finally left hospital on Tuesday, to a standing ovation from ward staff. I think one of one of the things that we didn't really do right at the start was celebrate those successes of patients leaving the ward - you tend to focus on the more tragic cases. So we have got better at that, and every patient that is discharged now, is a source of great joy. A couple of days ago Haroon updated us on what happened next. ""When I went to collect him from the hospital I didn't tell the rest of the family. I called them all down saying I needed to speak to them, and there was Dad sitting in his armchair. It was an amazing moment, just phenomenal, to have him home. ""He's just been out in the garden for the first time today and he was elated. He gets very tired very quickly so it's a slow process, but he's surrounded by love."" And Haroon's mum has now returned from Pakistan, so the family is together again. They're overjoyed.

"Three candidates - Eluned Morgan, Vaughan Gething and Mark Drakeford - are hoping to replace Carwyn Jones, who stands down next week. Labour officials will reveal the election result in Cardiff. It follows a year in Welsh politics marked by the death of former minister Carl Sargeant. Mr Sargeant was found dead in November 2017, days after the first minister sacked him from his cabinet over allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women. Mr Jones said he had been through the ""darkest of times"" when he announced his intention to quit in April. About 175,000 people - about 25,000 party members and 150,000 members of affiliated groups including trade unions - have been able to take part in the Labour poll, which closed last Monday. The winner will be Welsh Labour leader-elect until Carwyn Jones resigns next week, and will become the next first minister after confirmation by the assembly on Wednesday. They will lead the Welsh Government, which has responsibility for health, education, local government, transport and some taxes in Wales, among other areas of policy. At the conclusion of the contest, all four party groups represented in the Welsh assembly - including the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and UKIP - will have changed leader during 2018. Analysis By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor This has felt like a long leadership contest. Carwyn Jones's announcement of his departure was precipitated by the death of his former cabinet minister. By now, Carwyn Jones had hoped the trilogy of inquiries he set in motion in the wake of Mr Sargeant's death would have been completed. In fact the most important, into how he handled the sacking, is yet to start. The winner of today's contest will need to heal Welsh Labour of the divisions that emerged from the tragedy of Mr Sargeant's death - divisions which can only have been deepened by last week's inquest, which itself is yet to conclude. And if that wasn't enough, the winner takes over at a time of unprecedented change. They will have new powers over income tax. They will face an imminent Brexit and the chaos of the power struggle at Westminster. And then there's the M4 relief road. No pressure then. Who are the candidates? Mark Drakeford had been considered the front-runner in the contest, having won nominations from 16 assembly members. Born in Carmarthen, the finance secretary has been a key part of Labour's government in Cardiff for years - serving as a special advisor under the previous first minister Rhodri Morgan before becoming an AM in 2011, and a cabinet minister in 2013. An academic and a probation officer before full-time politics, the republican Cardiff West AM has the support of the Welsh version of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Labour faction Momentum - known as Welsh Labour Grassroots. Thought to be a sceptic on the proposed M4 Relief Road upgrade, his pledges include extending the smoking ban to outdoor areas of cafes and restaurants. Cardiff South and Penarth AM Vaughan Gething was the second candidate to get enough support to run. Less likely to see eye-to-eye with the politics of UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, at 44 the health secretary is the youngest candidate. Mr Gething, who was born in Zambia, has been a vocally critic of Mr Drakeford throughout the campaign, accusing him of having an ""awful"" tone on the subject of Brexit. The candidate said Mr Drakeford was ""reckless"" for invoking the memory of nuclear power plant disasters in a conversation about plans for a new Wylfa power plant. He has vowed to ensure school children that receive free school meals are fed outside of school terms, and pay for tuition fees for children leaving care. Eluned Morgan squeezed on to the ballot after a row about a lack of women candidates, thanks to a nomination from Carwyn Jones. The Cardiff-born vicar's daughter previously served as an MEP after she was elected to the European Parliament at the age of 27, in 1999 - she was the youngest at the time. Ms Morgan, who serves as a regional assembly member for Mid and West Wales, has promised free fitness trackers for secondary school children, supports the idea of a Universal Basic Income, and has said unemployed people could be given £1,000 to start their own business if she becomes first minister. Ms Morgan is a baroness - having represented Labour on the front bench in the House of Lords - and has vowed to relinquish the title if she wins. What happens next week? Carwyn Jones's final First Minister's Questions will to take place in the assembly on Tuesday. He will tender his resignation to the Queen via e-mail later that afternoon. That comes into effect whenever the palace replies. It is not known how quickly Her Majesty will reply. It is planned that the winner of the Welsh Labour leadership contest will be nominated on Wednesday. Both Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives will back their own leaders to be the next first minister - but the efforts are highly unlikely to succeed. The Labour-led Welsh Government has an assembly majority, thanks to the support of Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams and independent AM Lord Elis-Thomas.",The new leader of Welsh Labour - and the person set to become Wales' next first minister - will be announced shortly.
"Steve Rose, 74, felt it was time to say a fond farewell to the tree which has been decorated every year at the family home in Markham, near Caerphilly, since 1937. But while he was keen for a new family to have a vintage Christmas, these readers are still hanging on to their old trees and decorations. 'Our 95-year-old Christmas fairy appears every year' Few can say their Christmas fairy doll has seen two generations of Christmases over almost a century. Jane Andrews, 67, of Rhiwbina told BBC Radio Good Morning Wales she estimates her vintage fairy is 95 to 100 years old. The festive decoration originally belonged to Jane's mother-in-law who had it since she was five years old, growing up in Canton. ""She is beautiful, she has got a white proper skirt, a silver trim and a sprig of tinsel in her hair,"" Mrs Andrews said. ""We are all used to seeing these things every year, because they mean something to us."" The Christmas tree in the same room for 92 years Derek Stanton's three daughters are under strict instructions - they must never get rid of his Christmas tree. The 92-year-old was born on 5 December 1926 and his mother Winifred and father Job decided to buy one of the first mass-produced Christmas trees from the local Woolworths in Ilkeston for his first Christmas. It has been brought out every December since then and placed lovingly in the same living room - Derek and his wife Henrietta, 88, still live in his family home. ""It brings back so many memories for him,"" said his youngest daughter, Sally, 52. ""You can imagine why it's so important to him - it's been there since he was born. ""He said we have to put it up when he's gone. His dad had said to him ""never throw it away"" and he never has. And he's told us the same. ""My grandfather was a bit sentimental and I think my dad is the same."" Sally was with her parents last week when they put up the tiny tree for the 92nd year. ""When I was younger, we always used to have a big, real tree in the parlour and dad's tiny tree in the living room,"" she said. ""It is always exciting getting out the tiny baubles to decorate it. He still has some of those too, although quite a few have broken. ""The tree isn't in bad condition, although we have to stick a few of the branches back on with Sellotape. But dad tells everyone about his tree and they all love it."" 'We have 60 Father Christmases for every year of marriage' For every year of their 60 years of marriage, Sally Evans and her husband buy a new Father Christmas to add to their home decorations in Newport. The festive collection cover every piece of furniture, from peeping behind corners of picture frames, hanging from lights and sitting by the television. ""They remind me of the first year we were married,"" she said. ""When we were married, we had very little money wise but we would struggle. ""It is important to keep up the tradition for the kids - my daughter buys one every year too now."" Among the display is a 70-year-old Santa finger puppet from Woolworths she says takes pride place on the mantelpiece. 'Baubles remind me of my late daughter' Getting baubles for the Christmas tree in the early 1950s brightened up the festive decorations in Jeanette Phillips' childhood home. ""We used to cut down a real tree from the local woods and decorate it with small candles as there were no electric lights back then,"" said the 71-year-old, from Hook, Pembrokeshire. ""However, my father never lit the candles as he was afraid the tree would catch fire - he was quite safety conscious, which I suppose was a good thing. ""I remember my parents buying our first Christmas baubles when I was about six - and I still have them now. ""They are very tiny so they go at the top of our Christmas tree even now - alongside decorations bought when my children were little. The eldest is 48 now!"" Jeanette loves bringing our her old decorations - and the memories they bring back are all the more poignant after her 19-year-old daughter Jayne died in a car crash.

But the amount of incidents it has already attended in 2017, despite no extreme weather, points to ""another very busy year"", the team said. It said the increase could be linked with more people using the outdoors. The team said some of its calls were to support neighbouring rescue teams including Brecon, Longtown and Western Beacons.

"It comes after the defence secretary said 3,500 troops were ""held at readiness"" to help if the UK crashes out of the EU. The official call-up order was made in a ministerial statement on Thursday. Labour, which is calling for a no-deal to be ruled out, said the move showed the prospect was a ""serious threat"". Reservists, who have military training but also hold civilian jobs, will make up one in ten of the troops prepared to be deployed before the scheduled Brexit date of 29 March. Under the Reserve Forces Act, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson can call on the officers to be sent ""anywhere in the world"" if it is ""necessary or desirable"". The act says this can be done ""for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of life or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster"". The order will come into effect on 10 February and last until 9 February next year. Reserve forces will be ""on standby to deliver a range of defence outputs"" and help perform ""contingency plans developed by other government departments"", armed forces minister Mark Lancaster said in a ministerial statement. The Ministry of Defence said it has not yet received any requests for troops to be used by other departments. It added it ""routinely undertakes prudent contingency planning"" and the reservist scheme would have ""no major impacts on other defence outputs"". But Labour MP Ian Murray, who sits on the government's foreign affairs committee, said calling up reservists ""shows just how serious the threat of a no-deal Brexit is"". ""It is staggering that soldiers are being put on standby because of the risk of a constitutional crisis of the Government's own making,"" he continued.

"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - is launching a major campaign called Cyber Aware with its first ever TV ads. It says over last year's Christmas shopping period there was an average loss of £775 per incident from online shopping fraud. The NCSC is outlining six key things people can do to protect accounts. Online shopping has seen significant growth this year and is likely to reach new levels at Christmas - even with High Street shops now re-open again in many areas. And with that comes the risk from criminals. The NCSC is working on the campaign with the Home Office, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and aims to help individuals and organisations to protect themselves online. ""Scammers stole millions from internet shoppers last Christmas - but by following our advice, you can protect yourself from the majority of their crimes,"" said Lindy Cameron, chief executive of the NCSC. ""We hope the Cyber Aware campaign helps people to shop confidently online and enjoy their Christmas."" Statistics by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau reveal that over last year's Christmas shopping period (from November 2019 to end of January 2020) there were 17,405 reports of online shopping fraud, reporting a loss of £13.5m - an average of £775 per incident, according to the NCSC. As well as a website, there is also a television and radio advertising campaign running until Christmas Eve to advise on six essential behaviours to protect online accounts and devices. These are: ""As we approach the Christmas season, we should all be on our guard and take the practical Cyber Aware actions to keep us safe as we work, shop and socialise online,"" Penny Mordaunt, the Paymaster General said.",Online shoppers are being warned of the risks of cyber-fraud during the festive season.
"Workers using two excavators tried but failed to clear the 4.7 mile (7.5km) track. The railway resumed operations from Llanberis last week after the winter break but they were suspended within days after heavy snow on the mountain. Railway workers said they had experienced the worst weather conditions in more than a decade. Alan Kendall, general manager of Snowdon Mountain Railway, said: ""It's the worst I've experienced in the 11 years I've been here. ""We were looking forward to two good weeks at Easter but our first week has effectively been wiped out because of the weather. We're now working hard to try to get things turned round for the rest of the holiday period."" Around 12 people attempted to clear the snow on Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Kendall added: ""The snow is absolutely solid about half way up but we're using two rubber-wheeled excavators to help clear a way through."" Although trains had travelled to the summit over the last four years during Easter, traditionally the service went only as far as Clogwyn when Easter fell in March.

She claimed she planned to kill herself, but got back into bed hiding it from her husband. The court heard that at about 07:30 GMT she stabbed her husband and then dialled 999. The court heard from psychiatrists, who said she was suffering from severe depression with psychotic delusion at the time of the offence.

"Alan Shadrake, 75, is being detained on criminal defamation charges which carry a two-year prison sentence. However, the government says the book - which includes an interview with a former hangman - has not been banned. Mr Shadrake told reporters before his arrest that he was expecting trouble when he went to Singapore at the weekend to promote his book. ""If they do anything, it'll just draw more attention to it all, and they have no defence,"" he told AFP news agency. Contempt of court Mr Shadrake, who divides his time between Britain and Malaysia, is an investigative journalist and author. He has written for many international newspapers and the first major book in his 50-year career was The Yellow Pimpernels, which detailed escape stories across the Berlin Wall. His latest book, Once a Jolly Hangman - Singapore Justice in the Dock, includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore's Changi Prison, who has since retired. It also includes interviews with human rights activists, lawyers and former police officers. But the attorney general's office says the book casts doubt on the impartiality, integrity and independence of Singapore's judiciary. It wants to add contempt of court charges to the criminal defamation investigation that police say is already under way. The government told the BBC last week that the book had not been banned but that the government had the right to advise bookshops not to stock it. Movie banned The death penalty is mandatory in Singapore for murder, treason, drug trafficking and other crimes. Officials say it has been a key factor in keeping the crime rate low. Human rights monitors have long criticised the government however for using defamation suits to stifle political opposition. Separately, Singapore has banned a movie made by a local film-maker about a human rights activist, saying the film was not in the public interest.

"A court in New York ruled against the tech company, which has consistently fought the order issued in December as part of a drug-trafficking trial. Microsoft immediately announced plans to challenge the decision. The company has previously said it will allow users to choose where their data is stored. Emergency legislation Twitter released a report this week showing that the number of government requests for its users' data had almost doubled since last year. The social network said it received 1,257 requests from the US authorities in the six months to the end of June, and it handed over some information in 72% of cases. Microsoft's case has been closely watched by tech companies around the world, many of whom have rallied around their commercial rival's cause. The legal battle, thought to be the only one of its kind in the US, could affect the wider tech industry, which faces mounting pressure from government authorities to allow access to data. Last month, the UK voted through emergency legislation giving the security services access to people's phone and internet records, including some powers to go after those outside the country. Microsoft, which is one of the world's largest email providers, says this case is about protecting data customers' rights to privacy. The data requested by the US government is stored on servers in Dublin, the Irish capital, outside the country's legal jurisdiction. Reacting to the New York judge's verdict, Microsoft said: ""The district court's decision would not represent the final step in this process. Brad Smith, the company's general counsel, said: ""We will appeal promptly and continue to advocate that people's email deserves strong privacy protection in the US and around the world.""",Microsoft's latest attempt to resist a US government warrant demanding access to emails stored on servers in Ireland has been dismissed by a federal judge.
"Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said last year saw the highest number of incidents in Welsh rivers in recent years. In Carmarthenshire, anglers captured slurry flowing down a rural road. Alex Young, chairman of Abergwili Anglers Club, said it was ""sickening, you can see the pollution, smell it."" ""It's not just affecting the river, it's flowing into the estuary and then out to sea,"" he said. Pollution from farm based activities often impacts on the local environment, including normally rivers or other water courses. Farming Connect has been launched in an effort to reduce agricultural pollution, bringing together different bodies including Welsh Water, NRW farming unions and the Welsh Government. They are visiting 33 farms across the country to offer support and advice to farmers to reduce the number of pollution incidents. Sara Jenkins, a mentor, said: ""The campaign will focus on supporting farmers to take action to prevent pollution through the improved management of manures, slurries and soils and a reduction in the use of chemicals such as pesticides"". Marcus Ferraro, a dairy farmer at Sychpant Farm near Newcastle Emlyn, said he was already struggling to survive in the industry and would find it hard to get extra money to invest in pollution prevention measures. ""The changes can only happen with proper funding. If people want good quality food, they're going to have to pay for it."" Ioan Williams, from NRW ,said: ""We need to reassure them [farmers] that there is specialist advice on hand to improve their practices."" New regulations come into force in January and are designed to tighten the rules surrounding storage and spreading of slurry on farms. The Welsh Government said the changes were essential to reduce pollution water.",A new campaign has been launched to reduce agricultural pollution after figures show an increase of incidents in rivers.
"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A study found the substances, widely used for paint stripping and in the manufacture of PVC, are increasing much faster than previously thought. Mainly produced in China, these compounds are not currently regulated. Experts say their continued use could set back the closing of the ozone hole by up to 30 years. Scientists reported last year that they had detected the first clear evidence that the thinning of the protective ozone layer was diminishing. The Montreal Protocol, which was signed 30 years ago, was the key to this progress. It has progressively helped governments phase out the chlorofluorocarbons and the hydrochlorofluorocarbons that were causing the problem. However, concern has been growing over the past few years about a number of chemicals, dubbed ""very short-lived substances"". Dichloromethane is one of these chemicals, and is used as an industrial solvent and a paint remover. Levels in the atmosphere have increased by 60% over the past decade. Another compound highlighted in this new report is dichloroethane. It's used in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride or PVC, a light plastic widely used in construction, agriculture and elsewhere. For a long time, scientists believed that both these compounds would decay before getting up as far as the ozone layer. However, air samples analysed in this new study suggest this view may be mistaken and these destructive elements are getting there quicker and doing more damage than thought. The authors found that cold wind blows these chemicals from factories in China to the eastern Pacific. This is one of the main locations where air gets uplifted into the stratosphere. ""Our aircraft samples show the path from emissions in China, through the tropics in Malaysia and up to about 12km in the atmosphere,"" said lead author Dr David Oram from the University of East Anglia. ""This implies a route whereby these short-lived compounds can get into the atmosphere much quicker than if they had been released in North America or Manchester."" What is surprising for the scientists is that both these compounds are valuable and also toxic to workers, so there is every incentive for producers to ensure there is no leakage. However, the new study suggests that leaks and fugitive emissions are occurring and at rates which could have serious implications for the ozone layer. ""We believe that if we carry on with these emissions we'll delay the recovery of the layer,"" said Dr Oram. ""At the moment an average date for ozone recovery could be about 2050 but there are studies that say this could be delayed by 20-30 years depending on future emissions of things like dichloromethane."" The researchers say that a building boom in India is a concern as that will likely see a rise in the amounts of PVC being used with a knock-on effect on levels of dichloroethane in the air. Other scientists in this field are also concerned about the rise of these unregulated substances. ""Short lived chlorocarbons have been generally overlooked in terms of ozone loss in recent years,"" said Dr David Rowley from University College London, who wasn't involved in the study. ""This was wrong as they affect lower atmospheric ozone (and therefore oxidising capacity, the ability of the air to remove pollutants), but they can also be transported to the stratosphere through deep convective events, where they can destroy ozone really effectively."" However, some researchers are not convinced that the new study shows the compounds getting into the exact part of the atmosphere where damage to the ozone layer can be done. ""The measurements report dichloromethane at an altitude of 10-12km - this is still the troposphere,"" said Dr Susan Strahan from Nasa. ""To demonstrate that it is a threat to ozone requires measurements of dichloromethane in the tropical lower stratosphere. ""In the additional weeks required to travel to the lower stratosphere, which is above 16km, even more of the compound will be destroyed."" Despite these reservations, the authors of the new study are calling for policy makers to extend the remit of the Montreal Protocol to cover these very short-lived substances. The new paper has been published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.

"The Engage Trust said in its accounts the deficit was ""much greater than had been previously reported"". The situation was revealed at an employment tribunal as the trust's former business manager lost a claim for constructive dismissal. Trust bosses said the ""financial challenges"" had been ""systematically addressed with a robust recovery plan"". Board chairman Dennis Freeman said it had launched internal and external reviews to ensure it ""responded promptly and took appropriate action"" after discovering the discrepancy, first reported by the Eastern Daily Press. The Engage Trust runs 10 specialist schools across Norfolk for children outside mainstream education. 'Substantial financial problems' The deficit was found after the Education Education and Skills Funding Agency served a notice on the trust in September 2017, saying it needed to improve its financial wellbeing or face losing its delegated powers. It ordered an independent review into the trust's financial controls. ""That report showed there were significant and substantial financial problems to the tune of £1.2m,"" said employment judge Robin Postle. ""The board appeared completely unaware of this financial deficit; the size of it."" Former trust business manager Gillian Wardlow was suspended in March 2018 while allegations of ""serious financial mismanagement"" were investigated, said the report. She resigned in April 2018, days after the investigation concluded she should face a disciplinary process for alleged gross misconduct. She later claimed delays in the investigation had amounted to constructive dismissal. Chief executive Des Reynolds was suspended at the same time. He was dismissed in December, which the trust said was on grounds of gross misconduct. Ms Wardlow has been approached for comment. Mr Reynolds declined to comment. Under the name of the Short Stay School for Norfolk, the Engage Trust operates Douglas Bader School in Badersfield, Locksley School in Norwich and Brooklands School in Gorleston.

"By Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Dhaka There is a constant clanking of metals as hundreds of workers keep stripping iron plates and waste metal from broken ships. Trucks are lined up to carry the scrap metal to the local market. Huge gas cylinders, giant propellers and engines are strewn across the mud and the smell of oil and metal permeates the air. A huge oil tanker has been beached a few hundred metres away. As you approach, you are overwhelmed by the enormity of the ship. But the 190-metre long iron monster will be reduced to a heap of scrap metal in a few months by the workers. 'Back on track' Bangladesh's ship-breaking industry was the world's largest until 2009 when various legal campaigns by environmental groups almost shut down the sector. At the peak of their business a few years ago, shipyards in Sitakunda, described as the graveyard of ships, dismantled more than 200 ships a year. In 2010, due to court restrictions only 19 vessels were broken. However, last year, courts lifted the ban on the import of ships until government ministries formulate detailed guidelines for the ship-breaking sector. That has seen business pick up pace again, with 150 ships dismantled in 2011. Officials say 143 ships have already been broken in the first six months of 2012. ""The business is back on track and we are expecting more ships,"" Mr Alam says pointing to a pile of stripped steel from the ships. 'Vital to our economy' The industry is worth around $1bn (£640m) and shipyard-owners say the sector employs nearly 200,000 workers. Ship-breaking yard owners claim they provide nearly 60% of the country's total steel demand. With the boom in the construction sector in the country, there is a growing demand for iron and steel. They say the steel from the dismantled ships is also used by the country's ship-building industry. Hence they say, the more ships they can break, the better it will be for the steel supply. The industry is hoping to extract around three million tonnes of steel from the broken ships by the end of this year. ""The ship-breaking sector is vital to our economy as it supplies the much-needed steel and iron to our domestic market,"" Dilip Barua, the Bangladesh Industries Minister says. ""As we don't have any iron mine resources, ship-breaking is essential to boost our economic growth."" Shipyard owners argue that apart from contributing steel to the domestic industry, many parts of a ship such as propellers, generators and engines are reused or recycled. Environmental concerns Environmental groups argue that many of these ageing ships are not cleaned properly before they are brought to the shores. They say many of these vessels contain hazardous materials like asbestos and toxic chemicals. Campaigners claim that dozens of workers are killed in Bangladesh every year mostly due to gas explosions on ships they are breaking or due to other accidents at the yards. They say the workers are not getting paid enough either. On average, workers earn around $150 a month. ""The ship-breaking industry is not doing any good for our country. The environmental damage to the area has been immense,"" says Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a leading environmental campaigner. ""As far as we know, they haven't done any improvement in the working conditions."" She also disputes the industry's claim that it had been supplying nearly 60% of the country's steel demand. Shipyard-owners say the industry has been gradually evolving. ""Over the years, we have improved safety standards for our workers. We are also conscious of the environment,"" says Hefazutur Rahman, President of the Bangladesh Ship Breaking Association. ""The situation is different from what it was a few years back."" Strong growth Despite objections by environmentalists, more ships are expected to be brought to countries like Bangladesh, as it's too expensive to get rid of unwanted vessels in developed countries. Bangladesh's unique geography is also another reason why ageing ships are taken to the beaches there. The unique tide pattern makes it easy to ground the ship during occasional tides. The other leading countries in the ship-breaking business are India, Pakistan, Turkey and China. With their abundance of cheap labour, these countries control the global ship-breaking sector. And with the entire fleet of single-hulled oil tankers around the globe scheduled to be scrapped by 2026, ship-breaking yards in Bangladesh are likely to be busy for the coming years.","Mohammed Shahin Alam's sprawling yard on the muddy beaches of Sitakunda, near the southern port city of Chittagong, is buzzing with activity."

Exemptions to the changes were announced for those adopting children, those involved in kinship care and for multiple births. There was also an exception for a child born after ""non-consensual conception"". This is the so-called ""rape clause"". Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith was critical of the changes. He said the move meant women in Northern Ireland could be sent to prison if they fail to report a rape.

However, for one day only, guest anchor Marvin Humes from JLS was joined on the panel by singer and presenter Ronan Keating, radio DJ Roman Kemp and Love Island narrator Iain Stirling. They discussed mental health, therapy and dating rules; and also interviewed Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey. Earlier this year, Loose Women launched the Stand By Your Men campaign, focusing on male mental health and encouraging men to ask for help if they are struggling. ""We've had several men join us as honorary Loose Men over the years, but this is the first time we've handed over the entire show to the guys - and it's for a very important reason,"" said editor Sally Shelford ahead of the show. She added it was ""vital that men talk as openly about their struggles"" as the programme's all-female panel usually do, noting that Thursday was ""the perfect opportunity"" to get that message across. ITV has broadcast Loose Women on weekday lunchtimes since 1999, with a rotating line-up each day. Current regular panellists include Stacey Solomon, Brenda Edwards, Kaye Adams, Andrea McLean, Christine Lampard and Jane Moore. How was Loose Men received? Harriet Scott, who co-presents Magic Breakfast with Keating, praised her colleague and the rest of the guys for speaking so candidly about the taboo subject of mental health. Fellow broadcaster, Bobbi Norris described the show as ""refreshing"" and said he hoped to see more of the same on the telly in the near future. Fitness guru Charlie King was in full agreement. 'Take a little time for the me' During the programme, McConaughey, who won the best actor Oscar in 2014 for his role in Dallas Buyer's Club, shared his insights about how looks after his own mental wellbeing. ""The best tool that I have had is being able to know when to take a little time for the me,"" he said. ""Step away, take a little solitude,"" he added. ""Whether that's an hour a day for exercise, whether that's meditation, whether it's a prayer in church on Sunday, whether it's putting on a backpack and going to a foreign land where you don't speak the language and they don't know your name, whether that's going to a monastery. ""Just a little quiet time when we are stuck with ourselves, even though we may not like the company at that time, is really valuable time."" Keating revealed that he seeks the help of his loved ones and professionals, ""whenever I am feeling fragile, if I need to lean on somebody"". ""My wife can tell if I am overstressed, working too hard, things are getting on my back,"" said the former Boyzone star, and current radio presenter on Magic. ""Or maybe it's a certain date that reminds me of something that's happened, someone who has passed away. I talk to my therapist Dan. I will say to [his wife] Storm, 'Do you think it's time to speak to Dan?'"" He continued: ""Storm and I can have conversations but me and Dan don't live under the same roof. He gives me tools and I can take those home and maybe be a better person."" Host Humes opened the show by referencing the fact that suicide ""remains the most common cause of death for men aged 20-49"". ""One in three men are victims of domestic abuse and 33 men a day die from prostate cancer,"" he noted. Kemp, meanwhile, asserted his belief that conversations around men and their feelings need to start as early as possible. ""We need to be teaching boys at school to open up,"" said the Capital FM presenter. ""It's important to learn to defend yourself against your own brain.""

"Three is due to get access to the fast data network later this year. Provider EE was the first company in the UK to be able to offer customers access to 4G and received complaints about its pricing structures. Existing customers were asked to pay an extra £5 for the same amount of data they were entitled to with their 3G contracts. Last month the firm cut its entry price from £36 to £31 but the reduced cost was only available for new customers. Three says any customer with an ""ultrafast-ready"" smartphone, which includes Apple's iPhone 5, Nokia's Lumia 920 and the Sony Xperia Z, will qualify. ""As we add the next wave of technology to our ultrafast network, we've listened to our customers and thought long and hard about the right way to do it,"" said Three chief executive Dave Dyson. ""We don't want to limit ultrafast services to a select few based on a premium price and we've decided our customers will get this service as standard."" Ernest Doku, from price comparison website uSwitch.com, said the move ""flew in the face"" of the current pricing strategy for 4G in the UK. ""Three's move could really force the other networks to reconsider how they price their own forthcoming 4G deals,"" he said. ""That being said, there's nothing stopping Three from putting tariff prices up across the board ahead of a 4G rollout, so it's still a waiting game before we find out the true cost of super-fast mobile data in the UK.""",Mobile phone provider Three says it will not charge customers extra to upgrade to the 4G data service.
"The Royal College of Nursing is pressing for pay parity with colleagues in the rest of the UK and for improved staffing levels. This 48-hour action will see nurses working strictly to their contracts, including taking breaks. On Tuesday, it emerged paramedics will join strike action for 24 hours on Wednesday 18 December. The RCN Northern Ireland has issued a list of services that will be exempt from next Wednesday's planned strike action by health unions. They include chemotherapy inpatient and outpatient services, units providing palliative care, psychiatric intensive care units and intensive care units. Emergency Departments will not be exempt but life saving cover will be provided, the RCN added. The list has been given to its members, health and social care employers and the Department of Health. 'Point of collapse' Members of Unison - Northern Ireland's NI's largest health workers' union - are engaged in ongoing strike action. The Belfast Health Trust said all hospital surgical procedures, inpatients and day cases and all outpatient appointments will proceed as normal on Wednesday, except for outpatient appointments in the School of Dentistry. The Northern Trust says some routine appointments at the Causeway Hospital will be affected, while some services in the Western Trust will also be affected. The latest information can be found on the Health and Social Care Board website. The Royal College of Nursing's programme of industrial action began at the start of the December. It is the first time in the union's 103-history that members voted to take such action. The RCN said it had about 16,000 members in Northern Ireland, where some 17,000 nurses and 5,000 nursing support workers are employed in total. Nurses are refusing to do things like working overtime shifts, working unpaid hours and answering phones on wards. RCN Northern Ireland director Pat Cullen said nurses felt they had no choice but to take action. ""With around 2,800 vacant nursing posts in the system, record levels of expenditure on agency staff to try to plug the gaps, and nurses' pay continuing to fall further and further behind the rest of the UK, nursing staff have had enough,"" she said. Health workers have said they are unhappy about pay and claim staffing levels are ""unsafe"". The Royal College of Surgeons warned last month that Northern Ireland's healthcare system was ""at the point of collapse"". Unions rejected a new pay offer by the Department of Health last week because it did not reach parity with staff in England.",Nurses in Northern Ireland are taking part in a second day of their latest industrial action.
"It is thought the nitrous oxide cylinders were stolen from Dr Gray's Hospital at about 22:20 on Friday. Police are particularly keen to speak to two men aged about 25 with local accents, and a woman described as being about 18-years-old. They were seen driving away from Pluscarden Road in a white car with the boot open. One of the men was said to be wearing a black jacket and jeans, and the other a blue jacket and jeans. The woman was described as having long black hair. PC Brian Donaldson, who is investigating the theft, said: ""Nitrous oxide, or N2O, is commonly known as laughing gas and has analgesic properties when used medically. ""However, worryingly, it has been known to be used illegally as a recreational drug and can be used by car enthusiasts as a fuel additive. ""Nitrous oxide can be a dangerous substance if it is misused or consumed without medical supervision. Also, any attempt to interfere with the pressurised cylinders may result in serious injury if they are not handled correctly.""",Police have appealed for information following the theft of medical gas cylinders from an Elgin hospital.

Four men and two women, all teenagers, have been charged with affray. 'Horrendous' year Det Insp Warren Hines said he believed someone knew who killed Mr Kirwan. ""My belief is that at sometime in their life they are going to have to disclose that information to somebody.

Police said the owner put out the flames but not before the vehicle had been badly damaged as a result of the incident. PC Ross Hair said: ""It appears from early inquiries that a firework may have been set off inside the vehicle causing the fire.

"Hugh PymHealth editor@bbcHughPymon Twitter Simon Stevens, the new chief executive of NHS England, has kept a low profile in his first six months in the job. He clearly wanted to craft a concise vision for the NHS which would make people sit up and take notice. He is signalling a big shift in the way the NHS in England is managed and organised, in some ways the most radical since the service was born in 1948. Mr Stevens and his colleagues want to see barriers being removed and an end to the age-old divide between GPs with patients, and consultants with hospitals. There should, in his view, be no more top-down reorganisations, but instead the development of new models to suit local needs. Big picture He believes some communities will want to expand the role of GP practices allowing them to provide a much wider range of care. These practices might employ consultants and senior nurses with the aim of shifting most outpatient work away from hospitals. Alternatively leading hospitals might open their own GP surgeries. Smaller hospitals could be preserved if taken under the wing of larger institutions. The most radical option flagged up in the document is the development of ""Accountable Care Organisations"" similar to those in Spain and parts of the United States. Translated from the jargon, this means a single organisation taking responsibility for all of a local population's health needs. This could be a major hospital trust doing everything in its area, employing GPs and community health staff as well as acute care. This is big picture stuff and the sceptics will argue that it will take several years to develop these new models of care. Ambitious Hard-pressed GPs might feel immediate help is needed to reduce the pressure on their practices. The difference between no more government reorganisations of the NHS but allowing local communities to reinvent health care may not be easy to explain. For Westminster and the political parties, there is one key message - you have to find more money. Blanket demands for cash at a time of government austerity were never going to cut much ice. But Mr Stevens, with the support of the health regulator Monitor, has done some careful financial modelling. They say the NHS could stretch to the most ambitious efficiency savings in its history. Even after that though, increases above inflation are needed. Presented in a technocratic, non-political style and with the support of other NHS organisations, this call for more funding carries weight. So now it's over to NHS staff and managers, patients and the politicians. Mr Stevens and his colleagues have explained how they think the NHS can be made to work in the face of mounting pressures. But they believe they can only facilitate and encourage rather than order change from on high.","It may be only 39 pages long, but the so-called Five Year Forward View for the NHS in England packs more of a punch than many weightier tomes written in the corridors of power."
"The 48-year-old spoke publicly for the first time about his adoption at an early age on Wednesday evening, at The Irish Times Winter Nights festival. Ó Briain noted at the online event how he'd enjoyed a happy childhood in Bray with his ""supportive"" parents. But after being inspired by the film Philomena he tracked down his biological mother, who told him his adoption ""was built on shame"". ""I talked to my birth mother about it today, and I said, 'Look, did you want this?' and she said, 'There was no choice in this',"" said the Mock the Week host. ""The whole thing was built on shame and expediency and a feeling of, just get this done."" 'Hang on, am I adopted?' The stand-up comedian and broadcaster underlined he came from an ""unbelievably content family background"", and that his family were happy to discuss his adoption, but that the subject just didn't come up that often. ""Being adopted is a state of knowing you're adopted, then it not being mentioned for ages,"" he explained. ""And then at a point in later life going, 'Hang on, am I adopted?' ""I remember my father coming to London for lunch, and we had one of those conversations where you just clear the decks on everything. I told him, 'I seem to remember knowing this', and he said, 'Yeah, but it's not a secret. I quit telling you because, you know, why would you keep saying it?' It was only after seeing the Oscar-nominated Philomena - starring Dame Judi Dench as Irishwoman Philomena Lee embarking on a quest to find her adopted son, with the help of journalist Martin Sixsmith, played by Steve Coogan - that Ó Briain decided to start his own search. ""Maybe [my birth mother] might want to know how it turned out,"" he added. ""And maybe it's our responsibility to go, 'That worked out … I did end up in a stable home, and you should be grand about that'."" He has now met his birth mother and various biological siblings, but is yet to meet the whole family due to the pandemic restrictions. 'Unnecessarily hard' While the process of searching for his birth mother was largely a ""positive"" one, the TV funnyman did say the bureaucracy of it all was ""unnecessarily hard"". Under Irish law, the rights of the mother to privacy override the rights of the adopted child to find out who they are. During the interview, Ó Briain lifted up pages of adoption files, which had the word ""redacted"" on them. He ultimately sourced his own birth certificate, which he admitted was a nerve-wracking moment. ""I wanted to find a quiet moment to open this document. I remember finding it and reading it for the first time. It's an elemental piece of paper. It's a huge document to get in your hand,"" he continued.

"By Reality Check teamBBC News Theresa May announced that the new fund will distribute £1bn over seven years to places in England that have not benefited from economic growth as much as the more prosperous areas and there will be another £600m for which areas will be able to bid. Mr Lammy said that it was pathetic compared with what UK regions received from the EU. EU structural funding forms a range of investments given to poorer areas to help make them more prosperous. The University of Sheffield has compiled estimates for how much each region in England will have received from the EU for the seven years from 2014 to 2020. Funding until the end of 2020 has been guaranteed by the UK government, even if the country leaves the EU with no deal. The Stronger Towns Fund is small by comparison. But that's not a fair comparison. Even though the UK will lose EU structural funding when it leaves, the government has said it will come up with a Shared Prosperity Fund to take the place of the EU money. However, the government hasn't said how much money will be in the replacement fund or how it will be allocated. And it has been suggested that had the UK stayed in the EU, the poorer parts of the country would have seen an increase in their EU funding after 2020. This is because they have fallen further behind EU averages for prosperity since the calculations were last done. We are only looking at English regions here because that is all that is covered in the new government policy. The government has said it will make sure that the rest of the UK also benefits from new funding. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told BBC News the Stronger Towns Fund was a fresh package of support and that details of the Shared Prosperity Fund would be included in the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. So it is not surprising that the chart above shows the new scheme is dwarfed by EU funding. What is interesting is the way it highlights the differing priorities between the two. For example, among the English regions, the South West is the biggest recipient of EU funding but the second smallest recipient of the new money. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Tony Blair's former aide, who is now advising the Labour leader, said he expected a Labour-Lib Dem coalition after the next election. He told the Fabian Review Labour needed at least four ""hard-hitting"" policies. He suggested the case for state control of the railways ""should be explored"". Mr Campbell, one of the architects of New Labour and No 10 Director of Communications between 1997 and 2003, was hired last year to work on Labour's general election campaign and presentation of its political message. Although opinion polls currently suggest Labour may be on course to win the next election outright, critics of Mr Miliband's leadership have said the party should be further ahead and is still mistrusted on the economy. 'Not established' Mr Campbell said he had anticipated a coalition after the last election and he expected the same outcome this time, albeit between different parties. ""I think it will be a Lab-Lib coalition,"" he said. ""I was right in 2010. I knew it was going to be a Tory-Liberal coalition"". Shadow chancellor Ed Balls recently hinted he could work with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, comments interpreted as a thawing in relations between the two parties. The Labour leader, Mr Campbell added, needed to add more substance if the party was to live up to its One Nation tag - a slogan first used by Mr Miliband at the 2012 party conference. In addition to the party's pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months if it wins the next election, Mr Campbell said Labour needed a clear policy ""on the economy, a couple on public services and one about cultural space"". ""One Nation is not established. It means to the public whatever the public wants it to mean,"" he said. ""One Nation Labour worked last year for Ed Miliband's speech but it wasn't followed through with hard-hitting policy. Renationalising the railways was a policy that the public ""can latch onto and should be explored further"", he added. ""The fact that nationalising railways is even on the agenda now suggests we are living in a different age. Following the [economic] crash, a lot has changed."" Responding to the comments, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Labour had ""no long-term plan for the country"". ""They can only offer more of the same. More spending, more borrowing , more taxes and no amount of gimmicks will hide that,"" he said.","Ed Miliband is unlikely to win an outright majority in 2015 and needs more policies to back up his claim that Labour is a One Nation party, Alastair Campbell has said."
"Carried out in 2011 it found the number of housing units needed each year had risen from 340 in 2006, when the previous survey was conducted, to 451. Housing Minister Dave Jones said there had been great progress in social rented and partial ownership schemes. He said the focus now had to shift to ensuring there were enough houses for those who have the means to buy. Deputy Jones said: ""For islanders that don't qualify for partial ownership or social housing this is a real concern, as even where people have the wherewithal to purchase, there simply aren't enough properties to go round. 'Unfavourable economic conditions' ""There's nothing we can do to force a landowner or developer to build the houses that already have, or would get, planning permission."" In 2011 permission was given for the creation of 300 new homes, through new builds, converting pre-existing property into smaller units of accommodation or by converting other buildings into dwellings, but only 230 were created. The 2011 Housing Needs Study found the need for housing had risen as fewer people were expected to leave the island in the near future. Deputy Jones said: ""It appears that, presumably as a result of unfavourable economic conditions elsewhere, local people are opting to stay on the island for the foreseeable future. ""Anecdotally, the department has also heard of people who have returned to weather the storm here rather than look for work and accommodation elsewhere."" The survey, which involved interviews with 1,500 households across the island, found 80% of islanders were happy with their accommodation. The remainder complained about the condition of properties, a lack of facilities causing them to share a toilet or kitchen with another household, overcrowding and the high costs of rent and purchase. The results of the survey will be used to inform the ongoing review of the island's Development Plan. Environment Minister Roger Domaille said the next round of public consultation was due to be held next year. He said: ""Housing provision is one of the key development issues, so understanding the extent of housing requirements is crucial to determining what options are available. ""Like [the Housing Department] we think there is considerable merit in making this study available now so that the island has an informed debate on how much and what type of housing is required and how this requirement can be met over the coming years.""","Not enough new homes are being built in Guernsey, a housing needs survey has found."
"A public consultation in 2014 showed that more than 83% of those who took part favoured making microchipping compulsory. The government said that the move would be a ""huge help"" in reducing the number of lost and abandoned dogs in Scotland. The new law is set to be introduced in England and Wales at the same time. Rural Affairs secretary Richard Lochhead said: ""Scotland is a nation of animal lovers and so we must do all we can to safeguard dog welfare and promote responsible ownership. He said that he understood two-thirds of dogs in Scotland had already been microchipped voluntarily, and claimed that in 2014, over 10,000 dogs in the UK were reunited with their owners as a result of a microchip. ""This is an impressive figure, but it could be improved on dramatically by ensuring that all dogs are microchipped and, equally important, that their details are kept up-to-date,"" he added. Free microchipping Mr Lochhead made the announcement at the Dogs Trust in Glasgow. The charity offers free microchipping services at its rehoming centres and at mobile clinics throughout the country. Dogs Trust campaigns director Elvira Meucci said: ""We have long been a leading voice in the campaign for compulsory microchipping and are delighted to see the Scottish government legislate for this important component of dog welfare and responsible ownership. ""As the UK's largest dog welfare charity, reducing the nation's stray dog population is at the very heart of Dogs Trust's ethos, which is why we have committed to ensuring no dog owners will lack the financial ability to microchip their dog."" The British Veterinary Association (BVA) welcomed the announcement. They said that the government now had time to work out the details of implementing the measure and ensure that it created ""a reliable and trusted system that works effectively for both dog owners and vets"". Ronnie Soutar, President of the BVA Scotland branch, said: ""Our Scottish members will be delighted that the Scottish government has now committed to a date to introduce compulsory microchipping for dogs. ""We will work with Richard Lochhead and his team over the next 12 months to spread the message to vets and their clients across Scotland about the introduction of these essential regulations in 2016, making sure that owners are well-prepared and know their responsibilities."" 'Long overdue' Scottish Labour's spokeswoman for Rural Affairs, Sarah Boyack, said that the party had supported compulsory microchipping for some time. She added: ""While today's announcement is welcome, there is more that the Scottish government could be doing. Scottish Labour has backed a ban on the sale and use of electric shock collars and we challenge the Scottish government to match that commitment."" The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed the move, but said it was long overdue. Nanette Milne, MSP for the North East, said the party had been pressing the government to act on microchipping and to address ""the many complex issues"" around dog ownership. ""There are still a number of outstanding issues which the compulsory microchipping of all dogs will not address, namely puppy farms and the growth in the sale of puppies and dogs online, as well as the indiscriminate breeding of dogs in social rented properties and the lack of enforcement and dog control by local authorities,"" she said.",All dogs in Scotland will need to be microchipped from April 2016 under a planned change in the law by the Scottish government.
"Part of the widened road will run through the Battle of Killiecrankie site, where Jacobite forces fought government troops in 1689. It is part of a £3bn project to dual the road between Perth and Inverness. Transport Scotland said it was ""aware of the sensitivities"" around the battlefield. The agency said the existing A9 already runs through the Killiecrankie Battlefield and any widening will have ""some impact"" on the site. Eighty miles of the A9 is to be upgraded to dual carriageway in a massive project due to be completed by 2025. It includes some 14 miles of road between Killiecrankie and Glen Garry. The local public inquiry, which will be streamed on a web feed, begins later in Pitlochry. Dr Arran Johnston, of the Scottish Battlefields Trust, said the proposed route would be ""compounding the damage"" done by the existing A9. He said: ""Our great concern is that the significance of the battlefield wasn't given adequate weight when the decisions were being made as to how this route would be put together. ""That means some of the areas where the most intense fighting took place right along the length of the Williamite battle line will be obliterated."" The battle took place on 27 July 1689 between a Jacobite army under the command of John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount of Dundee, 'Bonnie Dundee', and a government army commanded by General Hugh Mackay. Both armies were attempting to reach Blair Atholl to use it as a base for future operations. The Jacobites are thought to have lost 800 men, with around 2,000 casualties among the government troops. Artefacts from the battle were discovered during a survey of the A9 dualling in 2016. Local campaigner James Bax said the dualling would put the new carriageway on top of where the actual fighting took place. He said: ""In doing that, we feel it degrades the current site unnecessarily. ""We do think there are ways to mitigate the current plans to make it easier for future generations to enjoy the battlefield."" A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the sensitivities around what is an important battlefield, and site of historical and cultural significance."" The agency said it has been ""engaging extensively"" with the local community and key stakeholders since 2012. It said a number of design refinements to ""reduce land take"" on the battlefield site have been made following feedback from Historic Environment Scotland and the local community. The spokesperson said: ""Ultimately, following detailed consideration of all objections made but not withdrawn, the Reporter will provide recommendations to the Scottish Ministers for their determination.""",Opponents of plans to upgrade the A9 at the site of a historic Highland Perthshire battle will take their concerns to a local public inquiry.
"The Greater Manchester Combined Authority aims to build at least 225,000 homes over the next 20 years. But Denton and Reddish Labour MP Andrew Gwynne and Tory MP for Bolton West Chris Green have vowed to fight plans to use some green belt land in parts of the scheme. A draft report on the scheme said the use of some green belt was ""essential"". 'Open book' The plans, known as the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework, are to be discussed by the combined authority's 10 council leaders on Friday before the launch of consultation. Mr Gwynne agreed there was a need for housing growth but is sceptical about the figures. ""It appears to be an open book for developers to pick and choose the most favourable sites to develop and those are very often in the green belt,"" he said. ""What really worries me is this green belt grabbing exercise will do nothing to spearhead the regeneration of urban parts of Greater Manchester that actually need the level of investment to ensure those communities continue to thrive."" Mr Green said he was opposing plans for 6,000 new homes near the M61. He argued developers should make better use of existing brownfield sites and build more apartment blocks in town centres. ""We have to look at building up and having a higher population density... [which] makes it easier to walk to the shops and cycling around... and makes public transport far more viable."" Alex Ganotis leader of Stockport Council, which is part of combined authority, said it will do all it can to ensure the developments were done ""in the right areas"". ""We won't build in any of these areas unless we can demonstrate infrastructure will be provided such as schools, GP surgeries, roads, public transport to support this.""","An MP has dubbed plans for thousands of new homes across Greater Manchester a ""green belt grabbing exercise""."
"Margaret Francis, 43, from Derbyshire, tested positive on 26 February, resulting in her son's school being closed and a media scrum in Buxton. Four ambulances and medics in protective gear meant her home ""looked like a scene from ET"". While fully recovered, she said she was not looking forward to ""back to normal"" and was nervous about crowds. In late February, while the threat of coronavirus was slowly being appreciated, it was still hoped cases in the UK could be contained. Ms Francis had briefly felt unwell while staying in a hotel in Tenerife and mentioned it during a routine GP appointment. She said: ""Everybody was very vague at first saying, 'No, no, you won't have it', then it was very quick to receiving a call from the public health service and it became a bit of a blur."" After being sent for a test, Ms Francis got a call to say she was positive. ""I was very, very shocked. It went from being a bit of a joke to quite scary. ""I just had no idea what the implications were,"" she said. Her diagnosis made her the 14th positive test in the UK, and one of the first residents, rather than a tourist or visitor. Just before midnight, four ambulances arrived at Ms Francis's house. ""It was very bizarre,"" she said. ""They were all in protective gear, they put me in protective gear, it looked like a scene from ET. ""The gravity hit me when I was leaving the house and saying goodbye to my son and boyfriend and I thought, 'This is real, this is happening'."" News of the diagnosis spread rapidly and her son's school, along with the GP surgery, were closed for a deep clean. Ms Francis spent 11 days in isolation in hospital in Liverpool undergoing tests. ""It was a huge rigmarole,"" she said, adding the eventual reunion with her son was ""very emotional"". Ms Francis said: ""I'm not looking forward to when things are getting back to normal.

"The deal to simplify trade procedures was done at a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting summit in Bali in Indonesia last year. But India has been blocking implementation of that agreement. It wanted assurances that its food security programme would not be challenged under the WTO's rules. India's concern was that complaints based on rules limiting farm subsidies might undermine its spending on food stockpiles intended to ensure that the poor have enough to eat. Food security programmes are covered by a so-called ""peace clause"" in which countries agreed to refrain from making such challenges until 2017. The US has now agreed to extend that commitment, in effect indefinitely. This bilateral agreement between the US and India still has to be endorsed by the full WTO membership, and it's likely to be discussed in the Organization's General Council next month. The breakthrough stems from a bilateral summit in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the US. It clears the way for the WTO to press ahead with the Trade Facilitation Agreement that was done in Bali. Analysts have estimated that that trade deal could add $1tn (£630bn) to the world economy, by reducing the costs of conducting trade by for example simplifying customs procedures. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement: ""On the basis of this breakthrough with India, we now look forward to working with all WTO Members and with Director General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the Trade Facilitation Agreement."" The statement also said Delhi and Washington have agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules ""until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted"". Analysis: Sanjoy Majumder, South Asia correspondent, BBC News This breakthrough on the issue of food subsidies will be seen as a major victory for India. Earlier this year, India refused to back the Trade Facilitation Agreement - a key deal which could add $1tn to the global economy and create more than 20 million jobs, mostly in developing countries. So India's decision to hold out was strongly criticised. Some even saw it as the beginning of the end of the WTO. India feared that signing up to the deal would affect its $12bn food security programme - a key welfare measure aimed at delivering millions of people from poverty. As part of this, India buys grains such as rice and wheat from farmers at above market prices, sells a part of it to poor households and stockpiles the rest to guard against shortages. It does this to both protect farmers, but also provide affordable food to many. Stockpile deadlock India's Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took to social media to share the latest developments, where she tweeted that India and the US ""had successfully resolved their impasse over food securities in #WTO"". The minister added later: ""WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us."" At the centre of the dispute, India had argued that the country itself and other developing economies see food stockpiling as a necessary measure to ensure poor farmers and consumers survive in the business community. But it involves subsidies for farmers, which can distort international trade and are subject to WTO disciplines. Western countries, led by the United States, have previously raised concerns that the stockpiles could affect global markets and skew trade. Who wins? ""This may be considered as a coup of sorts for Prime Minister Modi,"" says Vishnu Varathan, a senior economist from Mizuho Bank. He explains, ""getting the US and WTO to concede on food stockpiling helps define the prime minister as a firm leader, who is able to make progress while protecting India's vital interests."" Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist at consultancy IHS says the deal provides a good solution that addresses India's concerns. Mr Biswas adds, ""it is also a positive outcome for the WTO as it will pave the way for a very significant WTO trade liberalization agreement to be implemented at a time when some critics were beginning to question the future role of the WTO."" The Trade Facilitation Agreement, which is now likely to go ahead was NOT about reducing trade tariffs or customs duties, which are being discussed separately. Progress on that, and most other areas of the wide ranging WTO talks known as the Doha Round launched in 2001, has been slow. The TFA was the one major achievement from those extremely protracted negotiations.","India and the US have resolved their disagreements on food security issues, paving the way for the implementation of a global trade pact."
"Highland Council said it was facing costs of almost £2.5m due to the benefit change. It said causes of this debt included increased council tenant rent arrears and less grant funding from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The council and MP Drew Hendry have called on the government to step in. The DWP said rent arrears were ""complicated"", and that it was ""delivering flexibilities"" in universal credit payments in Scotland. In 2013, Inverness became the first place in Scotland to introduce universal credit. 'Put right the failings' Highland Council's costs burden of almost £2.5m relates to the implementation of universal credit full service in Inverness in June 2016, and across the rest of the Highlands in July 2017. Margaret Davidson, the council's leader, said the UK government should fully reimburse local authorities for the additional costs and loss of income attributable to universal credit. She said: ""It is only right that such costs be funded by the UK government rather than being met through Highland council tax and rent payers. ""These costs include increased rent arrears for current council tenants, additional housing benefit and council tax reduction administration costs arising from the manual processes that DWP introduced when designing universal credit, and reductions to the council's grant funding from DWP."" Ms Davidson said the DWP needed to ""put right the failings"" of the current system. Scottish choices SNP MP Mr Hendry, who obtained the figure through Freedom of Information, said: ""Day in, day out, Highland Council staff have to deal with a system littered with inefficiencies, and a host of process failures - costing, not only more time for officers, but lots more money from the council's budget."" A DWP spokesperson said: ""Our research shows that many people join universal credit with pre-existing arrears, but the proportion of people with arrears falls by a third after four months on universal credit. ""Anyone moving to universal credit from housing benefit is paid an additional two weeks of payment. ""In addition, in Scotland, we are delivering flexibilities in universal credit payments known as Scottish choices on behalf of the Scottish government, where people can choose if they want to be paid twice monthly or to have the housing element of their universal credit award paid directly to their landlord.""",The UK government has been asked to reimburse a local authority for the costs it has incurred as a result of implementing universal credit.
"From September 1941 to December 1944, Operation Dervish saw supply ships gather in Loch Ewe and on the Clyde before setting out to Russia. More than 3,000 seamen lost their lives to the freezing conditions and attacks by German submarines and aircraft. SNP MSP Rob Gibson secured a members debate which remembered and praised those who served on the convoys. Last month, a ceremony was held at Loch Ewe in Wester Ross to mark the first sailing of merchant and Royal Navy vessels from Loch Ewe to Murmansk and Archangel. Mr Gibson, MSP for Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, received cross party support for the debate. Surviving convoy veterans were expected to attend. Mr Gibson said the seamen have still not been properly recognised with a medal from the UK government. A special emblem was issued to veterans in 2006. 'True courage' Mr Gibson said: ""It is important that the Scottish Parliament put on record their admiration and gratitude for what these shipmates did. ""It was journey of true courage in a hellish environment with threats all around from the Nazi war machine and horrendous weather. ""It will be humbling to have the veterans in the chamber."" A fundraising campaign has started for a new museum in the Highlands recalling the convoys. Between 1941 and 1945, ships also left the Clyde and ports in Iceland for the then Soviet Union to deliver supplies, weapons and ammunition. PQ17 was the most disastrous and infamous of the convoys. In July 1942, more than 20 vessels were sunk following orders to scatter because of fears of an attack by warships including the Tirpitz. Great Britain, the US and Canada were involved in shipping supplies to Russia.",Tributes have been paid in the Scottish Parliament to surviving veterans of World War II's Arctic convoys.
"A new ""confidential mode"" can also be used to stop recipients being easily able to forward, copy, download or print correspondence sent via Gmail. The new facilities are part of a wider revamp of the cloud-based service. One expert said the options were ""long overdue"" but should help Google convince more businesses to sign up. ""This isn't unique. Other platforms, like Microsoft Exchange, let you use plug-ins to do something similar,"" said Chris Green, from tech consultancy Lewis. ""But none of the [major] cloud-based mail services have offered these data protection features until now, so they are quite distinctive in that respect."" Some smaller companies, including Proton Mail, have offered a message expiration feature before. Data privacy law Since it is not practical to remotely wipe emails from somebody else's computer after they have been downloaded, the self-destruct feature works by sending a link to a page where the sensitive content can be viewed rather than including the material in the original message. As an added safety measure, recipients can be required to type in a password to open the link. The anti-copy functions will not prevent determined users from replicating messages - screengrabs and photos of a computer display are still possible - but they are intended to minimise the risk of confidential data being accidentally passed on to the wrong party, which might constitute a data breach. The move comes a month before a new EU data privacy law - the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - comes into force. It requires organisations to notify local data watchdogs of a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware, and increases the amount they can be fined for non-compliance. ""The timing of this is not a coincidence,"" said Mr Green. ""A lot of this will be about ensuring that Gmail will continue to be a viable for enterprise users, as it will help them show they are GDPR-compliant.""

"After the elation of learning they are alive comes the agony of waiting. Seventeen days after the San Jose copper and gold mine collapsed, the news that all 33 men trapped inside are still alive was greeted with celebrations more than 2,000ft above them. But their loved ones will probably have to wait until Christmas to see them again, because it will take that long to bore a new hole wide enough to pull them through. Glucose, rehydration tablets, oxygen and medicine have made their way down from the surface through an 8cm lifeline and into the miners' refuge, which is thought to be about 50 square metres, although some reports say it could be larger. Trapped miners elsewhere in the world have had to wait to be rescued but very rarely, if ever, for this long. So what are some of the key challenges facing the men in the long months ahead? Having contact with loved ones These men have spent 17 days thinking perpetually of those whom they love and fearing they will never see them again, says Dr James Thompson, a senior psychology lecturer at University College London and an expert in trauma. This forms a tremendous emotional burden for people to carry, so finally being able to say to loved ones ""I'm alive"" will be a great release, he says. ""I understand they're going to put a telephone line down there so people can have private communication with their families. This is mostly to the good but also to the bad, because it will be intensely emotional and may sometimes make things very hard to bear."" It's important those above ground advise loved ones about what they should say, says Dr Thompson. It should all be resolutely focused on their release and the positive - so talk about the kids doing their homework, for example - and news about family bereavements or illnesses might be better undisclosed. Rescue updates should be managed in the same way, so if there is a setback and a drill breaks, then only tell the miners about it after it has been fixed. Dave Feickert, a New Zealand mining expert who is advising the Chinese government on improving health and safety, believes the physical challenges that would prove daunting to most people - the cramped conditions, the lack of daylight, the discomfort - will be taken in the stride of miners used to such harsh conditions. However, one aspect of their confinement he expects to trouble them is the sheer heat they will endure while trapped so far below ground. Estimates suggest the men will face temperatures of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius (90 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit), causing great discomfort, sapping their energy and potentially raising tensions among the group. He suggests it will be important for the crew at ground level to assess whether the heat is dry or humid and try to arrange suitable ventilation. ""The deeper you get, the hotter it becomes,"" Mr Feickert says. ""They'll be used to working in hot conditions, but not for that period of time. It's not going to be very comfortable."" Normally, in such temperatures, an adult would have to drink around four litres of water a day, says Dr Alan Richardson, a lecturer in exercise physiology at Brighton University. It may be difficult to keep them supplied with such a volume. ""If they don't get enough hydration they're going to lose weight through fluid loss,"" he says. ""The low level of oxygen is going to have the same effect."" Although their physical fitness will initially be a physical and psychological advantage, it will not take long for this to deteriorate, says Dr Richardson. ""The main issue they are going to have is muscle wastage by not being able to move as much as they can in everyday life. When they come out, it's going to be like coming off a space flight."" Dr Richardson suggests they should try to do simple isometric exercises - static resistance movements against the wall to work the muscles. However, it is virtually inevitable they will lose tone, sapping them of energy and making them more lethargic. In one sense, he says, this could have a positive side-effect, helping them sleep. But Mr Feickert says it will be psychologically very important for them to stay active. ""These are very fit guys who are used to a lot of physical activity, if they're suddenly not doing anything they're going to get depressed,"" he says. To counteract this boredom, Mr Feickert believes the miners need to organise themselves rotas for performing tasks and chores - everything from clearing rubble that comes through the shaft to cleaning. ""Even if it's work that isn't particularly useful, it's important to morale that they're doing something, plus it takes their mind off being trapped underground."" The ethos of mining and the risks that accompany the profession makes them a self-selecting group better equipped to endure this, says Dr Thompson. And there will probably be natural leaders among the group who can provide ""good, optimism-based leadership"". Tasks are important to break up the boredom and create routines, but should also have a practical use where possible. These could include making latrines, requesting items from above such as antiseptic for their hands, washing and disinfecting, and organising a rota for contact with families. Turning lights on during the day and off at night can help reinforce this cycle. ""They need to have a focus which is practical and somewhat future-orientated."" The miners have not been told how long they are going to have to wait and Dr Thompson says this is wise in these early stages. Stress can become intolerable when it appears to be endless, he says, and for the miners there is no safety signal to give, no ending in sight. ""They're going to ask 'how long?' and one way I would go about it is to say 'we don't know that yet but we're going to tell you where we are, this is what we are trying to do. This is the drill that is being brought in.'"" One reason why so many people recover mentally from a car crash is that it is over so quickly, says Dr Thompson. Sending the miners photos of the machine the rescuers are using to get them out would be one way of lifting their spirits as the wait goes on and on. With so many miners in such a confined space, guarding against injury and ill-health will be paramount. But according to Mike Tipton, professor of applied and human physiology at the University of Portsmouth, maintaining sanitary conditions will be a difficult task. As well as setting up and maintaining a sanitary system, there are other considerations, like having enough light to prevent knocking over a latrine and increasing health risks. ""Long-term survival will depend on the avoidance of infection and injury, sanitation will be an important factor in this regard and require some organisation,"" he says. ""If you've got 33 miners down there for 120 days, that's a lot of human waste you've got to manage and deal with."" What is more, there is little way of predicting whether further movements of rock pose a risk to the men. ""You also have the risk of further collapses and one of the miners getting hurt,"" says Prof Tipton. ""If someone is injured or gets sick they can send down medication, but what if it doesn't work? There aren't likely to be many paramedics among 33 miners.""","The first supplies have reached the 33 miners trapped 2,300ft (700m) underground in a collapsed mine in Chile. With an estimated four months before they are rescued, what are the key challenges they face?"
"The 66-year-old former Crewe Alexandra coach and Manchester City scout, also known as Richard Jones, entered the pleas at Chester Crown Court. He admitted nine offences, including indecent assault, in relation to two complainants between 1979 and 1988. Bennell is currently serving a 31-year sentence after being convicted of 50 child sexual offences. The former football talent spotter was described as the ""devil incarnate"" by a judge after he was convicted in 2018 of abusing 12 boys aged eight to 15 between 1979 and 1991. Judge Patrick Thompson said he would have to put himself in the position of the previous judge and decide how much extra he could have imposed had he been aware there were two more complainants. He added: ""It is important the two victims have the opportunity to come to court."" Bennell appeared at the court via videolink from from HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire. Eleanor Laws QC, defending, asked that Bennell not be required to attend court in person for his sentencing, as he was ""not very well"" and ""vulnerable because of his health"". Bennell's 2018 trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard he was a ""predatory paedophile"" who preyed on young footballers he was supposed to be coaching. Many later came forward to give evidence against him. Some said they felt they could never recover from the abuse they suffered. Bennell was previously convicted of of child abuse on three other occasions. He received jail sentences in the UK and in the US in 1995, 1998 and 2015. The latest hearing was adjourned until 5 October.",Former football coach and serial paedophile Barry Bennell has pleaded guilty to nine sexual offences.
"New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said residents would be able to return to their homes. But he warned that fresh challenges lay ahead in the coming days amid unfavourable conditions. In total, 73 fires are burning across the state, 29 of which are uncontained. Meanwhile, a fire service investigation has concluded the largest of the fires in the Blue Mountains - State Mine near Lithgow - was caused by explosives training at an army range at Marrangaroo last Wednesday. Mr Fitzsimmons confirmed the cause of the fire was ""on a live firing range as a result of the detonation of some ordnance"", but he said: ""Any suggestion that this practice would be on par with someone deliberately lighting fires, reckless or criminal, is outrageous"". The defence department has not yet commented on the findings, but acknowledged at the weekend that it could have been the cause. The findings have angered Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill who said the army ""should not have been firing"" on such a hot, dry day. Hundreds of homes have already been destroyed as more than 3,000 firefighters battle to contain the bushfires in Australia's most populous state. 'Stay vigilant' Fire officials had warned that Wednesday's combination of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds could lead to more devastation. But fire chiefs confirmed by the end of the day that not one home had been lost. ""If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today, to be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Fire chiefs say a combination of back-burning - the controlled burning of areas with the aim of depriving a fire of fuel - building lines of containment and strategic planning had paid off. In particular, firefighters on Tuesday merged the State Mine fire with one at Mount Victoria to prevent them linking up with the third. ""It is absolutely wonderful it did not run,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. But he warned people to remain extremely vigilant. ""There are still fires flaring up,"" he said. ""There's every prospect we're going to see some more."" Many schools in the Blue Mountains are expected to remain closed on Thursday. A major highway through the region is also closed. Emergency alerts remain in place near the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney. An emergency alert in Springwood, to the west, has been downgraded to a watch-and-act alert. How eucalyptus trees help bushfires to spread Earlier, new Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres linking bushfires to global warming and criticising his decision to repeal a tax on carbon emissions introduced by the previous government. ""The official in question is talking through her hat,"" Mr Abbott told local media. ""Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it. But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change - they're just a function of life in Australia."" Mr Abbott, who took office in September, has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.","Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney ""has been averted"" for the day, but warn the crisis is far from over."

"Marc Cole, 30, was confronted by the officer on a street in Falmouth, Cornwall, as he was carrying a kitchen knife and having delusional thoughts. PC Timothy Wilson told the hearing in Truro he used the Taser to try to disarm Mr Cole. He said Mr Cole was holding the knife to his own throat and ""seemed determined to cause himself an injury"". The officer was first on the scene in the evening of 23 May 2017 and said Mr Cole appeared ""agitated"". ""It was clear I needed to do something,"" PC Wilson said. After an initial Taser activation lasting six seconds Mr Cole lifted the knife to his throat again, so PC Wilson reactivated the device for a further 22 seconds. ""He slid down the wall with the knife still in his hand,"" PC Wilson said, adding: ""I was again fearful he was going to cause himself serious injury so I reactivated the Taser."" During the third activation, another officer used his baton to strike the knife out of Mr Cole's hand. 'Mental breakdown' The inquest heard how PC Wilson said in an initial statement he had only activated the Taser once, and in a second statement in September 2017 said he used it twice. Asked by the coroner why he said this he said he was ""given guidance"" by the Police Federation and followed it. ""I was aware of two activations, maybe more, but I wasn't sure at the time"" he said. Mr Cole's brother Daniel Cole told the court his sibling was having ""a mental breakdown"". He had also been taking cocaine during the afternoon which the inquest heard would have increased the chance of having an adverse effect from the Taser. He was taken to hospital by ambulance and died later that night. The inquest continues.","A police officer who used a Taser three times on a man who later died ""feared for his life"", an inquest has heard."
"Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said the incident happened on 30 January near islands claimed by both nations in the East China Sea. He said this had prompted Tokyo to lodge a formal protest with Beijing. The row, over islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, has escalated in recent months. Taiwan also claims the island chain (known as Diaoyutai in Taipei), which is controlled by Japan. Last week, tensions between Tokyo and Beijing appeared to be easing after a Japanese delegation met senior Chinese leaders and both sides later expressed hopes that relations could improve, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo reports. But on Monday China sent patrol ships back in to the disputed waters around the islands, our correspondent adds. 'Dangerous situation' ""On 30 January, something like fire-control radar was directed at a Japan Self-Defence Maritime escort ship in the East China Sea,"" Mr Onodera told reporters on Tuesday. The minister said Japan's Yuudachi vessel and the Chinese frigate were about 3km (two miles) apart at the time, Japan's Kyodo News reports. Asked about the delay in filing the protest, Mr Onodera said it took the ministry until Tuesday to determine that a fire-control radar had indeed locked on the Japanese ship. He added that a Japanese military helicopter was also targeted with a similar type of radar by another Chinese frigate on 19 January. ""Directing such radar is very abnormal. We recognise it would create a very dangerous situation if a single misstep occurred,"" he said. Radars use radio waves to detect the intended target and then guide missiles or other weapons. China's UN move Also on Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador to Japan rebuffed an earlier protest over continuing Chinese patrols off the disputed islands, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Ambassador Cheng Yonghua said the islands and the surrounding waters were China's ""inherent territory"". The dispute over their ownership of the islands has continued for years, but it reignited in 2012 when the Japanese government purchased three of the islands from their private Japanese owner. The move triggered diplomatic protests from Beijing and Taipei, and sparked small public protests in China, affecting some Japanese businesses operating in the country. Chinese government ships have since sailed many times through what Japan says are its territorial waters around the islands. Late last year, a Chinese government plane also flew over the islands in what Japan called a violation of its airspace. In response, Tokyo has moved to increase military spending for the first time in a decade. The eight uninhabited islands and rocks lie close to strategically important shipping lanes, offer rich fishing grounds and are thought to contain oil deposits. In December, Beijing submitted to the UN a detailed explanation of its claims to the disputed islands. A UN commission of geological experts will examine China's submission but does not have the authority to resolve conflicting claims.","A Chinese navy frigate has locked its weapon-targeting radar on a Japanese ship, Tokyo says, amid mounting tensions over a territorial row."
"Daniel Noddings, 37, was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car at Sainsbury's in Grantham when Det Con Sara Willcock went to help. He came to, but reversed with an open door, knocking her to the ground. Noddings, of no fixed address, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Lincoln Crown Court. He also admitted further charges of dangerous driving and possession of cannabis. He was sentenced on Friday to 40 weeks in prison and given a four-year driving ban to start on his release from custody. The incident, which took place on the morning of 7 October last year, left Det Con Willcock with serious injuries including a fractured skull, bleeding to her brain and severe bruising to her brain. 'Lucky to survive' The court heard her brain injuries were so serious that doctors later told her she was lucky to survive.

"Cancer researchers in Europe analysed blood from 265 men with the disease. They found those with multiple copies of a particular gene did not respond to abiraterone and enzalutamide - drugs commonly used to treat advanced cases. More trials are needed but the team hope the test could prevent thousands of men undergoing unnecessary treatment and allow more personalised care. The drugs abiraterone and enzalutamide are given to men whose cancer is no longer responding to traditional hormone therapy and has started to spread. Costing less than £50, the test is a quick and relatively cheap way of preventing men from undergoing the side effects of therapy that will fail. 'Significant step' Lead researcher Dr Gerhardt Attard, from the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: ""Abiraterone and enzalutamide are excellent treatments for advanced prostate cancer and some men can take these drugs for years without seeing a return of their cancer. ""But in other men, these drugs do not work well and the disease rapidly returns. Currently, there is no approved test to help doctors choose whether these are the best treatments for an individual. ""We have developed a robust test that can be used in the clinic to pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer are likely to respond to abiraterone and enzalutamide, and which men might need alternative treatments."" For the study, published in the journal Annals of Oncology, scientists took blood samples from patients taking part in three different clinical trials. Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said the test could be a significant step towards moving away from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to treatment. About 46,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK every year, one in four of them at an advanced stage.",A blood test has been developed that could help target treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer.

Giving evidence at the inquests earlier, Mr Howles said that when he arrived at the Mulberry Bush, two youths ""just on the other side of Worcester Street"" attracted his attention, before telling him that there was ""something suspicious"" beneath a bench. 'Looked pristine' It was then that he discovered the weapon, he said. ""I would have thought if something had been left lying underneath there... it would have gathered dirt, but it didn't, it looked pristine"", he added. He gave it to Insp Roderick Richards as soon as he could, he said. However, in a statement, Insp Richards said that PC Howles had not handed him a firearm. No CCTV Mr Howles said it had later occurred to him that the weapon could have been dropped by a perpetrator. He said he never found out what had happened to it. Previously, the inquest heard that police did not collect CCTV from that night. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) is believed to have carried out the bombings, although no-one has ever claimed responsibility. The inquests continue.

"North Wales Police are using DNA tests in a bid to solve 17 separate cold cases of unidentified human remains found in their area from 1968 to 2011. It is known as Operation Orchid. Tests have suggested a body found at Cable Bay, Anglesey, in 1994 could be that of Pauline Finlay who went missing on the Wexford coast earlier that year. 'Significant breakthrough' The Wexford woman disappeared while walking her dogs near the coastal village of Kilmuckridge in March 1994. Formal identification has not yet taken place but North Wales Police have contacted her family about the results of their tests. The force has submitted a file to the local coroner and an inquest will be held at a later date. In a statement, North Wales Police described the recent development as a ""significant breakthrough"" in the 22-year-old case. Most of the 17 cold cases under re-examination involve bodies found around the coast. Grave The separate cases are not being treated as crimes, but detectives want to identify the remains to give families closure. At the time the Cable Bay body was discovered, the unidentified woman's death was not thought to be suspicious. An ""open verdict"" was recorded and her remains were buried in a cemetery in Wales. Members of the Finlay family are due to travel to Wales within weeks to visit the grave which may contain their relative's remains, according to a report by Irish broadcaster RTÉ. A date for the inquest has not yet been set.","An unidentified body found on a beach in Wales 22 years ago may be that of an Irishwoman who went missing along the Irish coast that year, police believe."
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York The electric car-maker is facing a cash crunch, caused by a combination of a major debt load and heavy spending. Tesla boss Elon Musk says the firm could be profitable this year and dismissed concerns with an April Fool's Day joke about bankruptcy. However, analysts are less jovial and say Tesla's problems are serious. Since September, the firm's shares have fallen by about a quarter to $296 - and many investors think they will continue to drop. As of April 25, Tesla was the most shorted company in the US, according to S3 Partners, a financial data and analytics firm. John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, is one of the people who has put money on the idea that the share price will collapse, placing pressure on the company and eventually leading to bankruptcy. ""Over the next three to six months, I've said I think the stock will fall significantly, at which time the capital markets will close to Tesla entirely,"" he said. ""Then it's just a matter of time given their losses and their capital expenditure needs."" Tesla, which has not made an annual profit in its 15-year history, had more than $10bn in debt at the end of 2017 and $3.4bn in cash. The firm has been spending heavily to increase production of its newest car, the Model 3, but continues to fall short of manufacturing forecasts despite robust customer demand. It made just 9,800 Model 3s in the first three months of the year, compared to an earlier goal of 5,000 vehicles a week. Last summer, Mr Musk said Tesla was spending about $100m a week to ramp up production. Bloomberg recently calculated that it continues to spend more than $6,500 per minute. ""I don't see how Tesla's going to survive, given their capital structure, meaning they have a ton of debt and continued massive losses,"" Mr Thompson said. Tesla has previously tapped investors for more money, as well as collecting deposits from customers lining up for its cars. It raised more than $3bn on Wall Street last year, largely by issuing debt, cashing in on the enthusiasm for the firm and Mr Musk, 46, also known for his SpaceX rocket venture, punchy Twitter personality and tortured personal life. This year, Tesla has maintained that it does not need to raise money apart from its ""standard credit lines"", citing improving production. But in March Moody's said it expects the firm will need to raise about $2bn in the near-term. At the same time, the credit rating agency downgraded Tesla debt, citing the production struggles. Tesla fans, who include celebrities such as Kanye West, remain legion, and demand for both its debt and shares was strong last year. Mr Thompson, for one, thinks sentiment is shifting: ""I think the story of, 'the next car is profitable, the next great thing is going to save the company', is sort of getting old and ... people are starting to realise that."" In addition to the manufacturing issues, Tesla has faced negative publicity for conflicts of interest on its board, as well as working conditions. Its autopilot feature is under scrutiny after fatal accidents and the company recently recalled more than 100,000 Model S cars for an issue with the power steering. Tesla has said its high public profile makes it a target for critics and Mr Musk, who has dubbed short-sellers ""jerks"", recently told CBS he is optimistic about the firm's ""path out of hell"". Tesla's challenges did not stop shareholders from awarding Mr Musk a record pay package earlier this year. ""It should be pretty obvious, I think, that I'm not gonna joke about bankruptcy if I think it's remotely real,"" Mr Musk said. ""I'm feeling pretty optimistic about where Tesla is at this point. At this point I can have a clear understanding of the path out of hell, and I did not, until recently, have a clear understanding.""",Tesla is facing more questions about its financial viability ahead of its latest results on Wednesday.
"The NHS said the hub, based at the Redgrave Children and Young People's Centre, could enable thousands of people to be vaccinated each week. It will offer jabs to over-75s and health and social care staff. Dr Sarah Whiteman, from the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes CCGs, said it was ""a big step forward in helping beat the Covid-19 pandemic"". Emanuel Deroses, 87, was one of the first people to be vaccinated at the centre and he urged others to take up the offer. ""I think all Afro-Caribbeans should take it because it's very important - I've watched people in hospital beds dying,"" he said. ""Go for the jab, you don't feel nothing. It was just like when I had the flu jab - no different."" Sheila McCulloch, 77, said she was happy to be able to have the vaccine in Luton after originally being offered an appointment 12 miles (19km) away. ""It only takes a minute… and if it's there why not take it?"" she said. Local figures Nationally, more than 6.5 million people in the UK have now received a first dose of a vaccine, and more than 470,000 people have had a second. In the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes area, 22,292 of the 39,719 people aged 80 and above had received a first dose of the vaccine in the latest government statistics going up to 17 January. Some 4,062 had also received a second dose. That first dose rate of 56.1% was below the UK figure of 75%. The coronavirus case rate in Luton in the week to 21 January had fallen to 658.1 cases per 100,000 people, but that was the 16th-highest for a district in England. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Luton is almost 16,000 since testing started. The vaccination centre at Redgrave Children and Young People's Centre is being run by Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust. Dr Whiteman said: ""We have been working hard with our partner organisations in the lead up to opening the centre today.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Tech giant Facebook and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. The boss of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, has since been suspended, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a Commons parliamentary committee to give evidence. How has Cambridge Analytica been accused of sleazy tactics? Channel 4 News sent an undercover reporter to meet executives from data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, following reports by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer newspaper. The firm had been credited with helping Donald Trump to presidential victory. The reporter posed as a Sri Lankan businessman wanting to influence a local election. Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix was apparently filmed giving examples of how his firm could discredit political rivals by arranging various smear campaigns, including setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging situations in which apparent bribery could be caught on camera. The firm denies all the claims and says the documentary was ""edited and scripted to grossly represent the nature of those conversations"". It claims the conversations were led by the reporters. ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honey traps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose,"" said Mr Nix. What was Facebook's role? In 2014 a quiz on Facebook invited users to find out their personality type. It was developed by University of Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan (the university has no connections with Cambridge Analytica). As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can scrape in this way. Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. Cambridge Analytica denies any of it was used as part of the services it provided to the Trump campaign. Is this against Facebook's terms? The data was gathered using Facebook's infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it - but the data was not authorised for them to share with others. The other key point is that even the people directly taking part in the personality quiz would have had no idea that they were potentially sharing their data with Donald Trump's election campaign. Facebook say when they learned their rules had been breached, they removed the app and demanded assurances that the information had been deleted. Cambridge Analytica claims that it never used the data, and deleted it when Facebook told it to. Both Facebook and the UK Information Commissioner want to find out whether it was properly destroyed, as Mr Wylie claims it was not. What has the official response been? US senators have called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how Facebook will protect users. In the UK, the chairman of a parliamentary committee, Damian Collins, has summoned Mr Zuckerberg to explain the ""catastrophic failure"" to MPs. The head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very concerned"" about the revelations. Meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, saying his comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm"". And the academic who created the app at the centre of the storm, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, said he has been made ""a scapegoat"". How can you protect your data? There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.""","It's a sensational story containing allegations of sleaze, psychological manipulation and data misuse that has provoked an internationally furious response."

"By Lauren PottsBBC News Many thousands of people across the UK rely on a network of food banks for their day-to-day survival. It's easy to understand that when food is in scarce supply hygiene isn't always the top priority. But according to research conducted by the Trussell Trust, which has a 428-strong network of food banks nationwide, more than half of people using its services cannot afford toiletries. ""If you don't have enough money to cover the cost of food, it's likely you'll be unable to afford other essentials too,"" said Samantha Stapley, its head of operations for England. ""No-one should be left struggling to wash their hair, brush their teeth or afford tampons because they've been hit by something unexpected like redundancy, sickness or a delayed benefit payment. ""This is a dignity issue."" When faced with the choice of being able to afford food or face wipes the answer is obvious, says journalist Sali Hughes, who has joined forces with beauty director Jo Jones and the Trussell Trust to launch Beauty Banks. ""Some people don't have enough money to survive, so what's going to go? The thing that you don't need to stay alive. ""But I don't think having clean teeth is a luxury. Having clean hair isn't being spoiled - in 2018, in Britain, it's a right."" The pair is pooling their collective industry resources by teaming up with brands, retailers and the wider community to gather as many toothbrushes, razors and tampons as possible to help those unable to afford the basics. The non-profit aims to funnel unwanted toiletries for both men and women to five locations across the UK - a women's refuge and a food bank in Staines in Surrey, a homeless shelter in Cardiff, a food bank in Milton Keynes, and another in Ladbroke Grove, not far from Grenfell Tower. ""People really need these things and not being clean and being dirty is the difference between having a bad or good day, of feeling employable and feeling good about themselves,"" said Ms Hughes. ""These are things we take for granted. We often don't think twice about buying shower gel, but [for some] that can make the difference between being clean and not being able to eat."" Ms Hughes, who has written in the past about her own experience of homelessness, was in part inspired to launch the scheme after taking part in a recent Sleep Out event run by youth homelessness charity Centrepoint. She and others, including fellow writer Caitlin Moran, spent the night on the street and raised more than £40,000. On Instagram, she described how ""brutal"" the experience of sleeping rough was - ""freezing cold, turfed out and moved on at 6:30am, nowhere to clean my teeth or wash my face"". In another, she posted a picture of face wipes and tampons, adding: ""These are the basics I need for sleeping rough tonight and I am lucky enough to be able to just go out and buy them. People on the streets can't."" According to recent government figures, there were 4,751 people counted or estimated to be bedding down outside in autumn 2017 - a 15% rise on the year before and more than double the figure recorded five years ago. In July, the In Kind Direct charity also warned of a rise in ""hygiene poverty"" - in which families across the UK were reporting a crisis in being unable to afford essential toiletries. Coupled with increasing reports of period poverty - in which girls across the country are routinely skipping school because they cannot afford sanitary protection - Ms Hughes and Mrs Jones started to talk about how they could help. ""The thought of not being able to buy something you absolutely need to protect yourself during your period, it's such a stark reality most of us don't consider,"" said Ms Hughes. ""As women, we know we need tampons, so we chuck them in the trolley in supermarkets and that's the most you think about it. The idea you can't afford to keep clean, it's such a big part of how we feel about ourselves. ""When you feel dirty and your hair's dirty, you're constantly thinking 'do people think I'm grotty, do I smell?' People are living like this. It's monstrous, it's really shocking."" Mrs Jones said she came up with the idea of donating unwanted and surplus toiletries to food banks about six months ago after realising there was a huge demand for non-food items. She and Ms Hughes had also often talked about how much product was being wasted in the beauty industry. ""We started talking about marrying the gap between the waste in our industry and getting it into the hands of people who really need it. ""Beauty directors and writers get sent products all the time and people in our industry are really kind and generous, but they don't know what to with [surplus goods] or how to channel it to the right places."" You might also be interested in Four stories of rough sleeping in England 'I couldn't mourn my gran because of my period' Second chance careers that paid off Mrs Jones said the turning point came when she got the company she works for, Communications Store, involved. ""It's all well and good sending a lot of products to a food bank but that's only part of the solution. Who's going to sort it out and pack it up? So that's when I went to my agency and said, 'can we support this', and my boss said 'yes'. ""Our staff are packing the stuff up and we're covering the cost of sending it out, so that when it arrives [at the food banks], it's already sorted. We want to make it as easy as possible to distribute."" Donations will be parcelled up and sent to each of the five locations supported by the Trust. Though starting small, Ms Hughes hopes to roll the Beauty Banks project out to further locations and is encouraging people to get involved. ""We don't want people to donate money. But we would love members of the public to send their spare toiletries that they have lying around. ""We're looking for really essential toiletries like deodorant, we want shaving gel, razors, tampons, sanitary towels. We need shampoo, soap, baby wipes, flannels and toothbrushes. ""We would like people to throw a box of tampons in their basket and then throw in another to donate, or to donate the soap their aunts gave them two Christmases ago. ""Provided they're unused - they will find a good home.""","Most of us give barely a thought to the cost of shampoo, soap and sanitary towels when stocking up on everyday essentials in the toiletry aisle. But for those living in poverty - whether on the streets or in homes on a shoestring budget - basic hygiene has become a backseat luxury."
"The Carmichael mine, approved by the government last year, would have been one of world's biggest coal mines. Critics challenged the decision in the Federal Court of Australia because of a range of environmental concerns. The court said on Tuesday that the environment minister had failed to heed advice about threats to vulnerable animal species. The decision means the mine could not legally operate until fresh approval was granted, according to Sue Higginson, the principal solicitor for the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) in New South Wales (NSW) Two threatened species The EDO challenged the government's approval of the mine on behalf of the Mackay Conservation Group. The conservation advice describes the threats to the survival of two species found only in Queensland, the Yakka Skink and the Ornamental Snake, Ms Higginson said in a statement. ""The law requires that the Minister consider these conservation advices so that he understands the impacts of the decision that he is making on matters of national environmental significance, in this case the threatened species,"" she said. The Department of Environment said in a statement that reconsidering the decision would not require revisiting the entire approval process. ""Without pre-empting a final decision about the project, the Department expects that it will take six to eight weeks to prepare its advice and the supporting documentation, and for the Minister to reconsider his final decision,"" it said. Massive coal exports Adani, which has struggled to get financial backing for the project, had also won earlier approval to build a new coal port terminal on the Queensland coast to support exports from the mine. In a statement, the company said it was regrettable ""a technical legal error from the Federal Environment Department has exposed the approval to an adverse decision"". ""Adani will await the Minister and his department's timely reconsideration of its approval application ... Adani is confident the conditions imposed on the existing approval are robust and appropriate,"" it said. The project would have dug up and exported about 60m tonnes of coal a year, mostly to India. Environmentalists and reef scientists said work on the port could damage the nearby Great Barrier Reef. Situated in the Galilee Basin in the central Queensland region, the Carmichael project would have included open cut and underground mines. There were concerns also the mine, which would require about 12 billion litres of water every year, would drain groundwater supplies in the Galilee Basin.",An Australian court has overturned government approval for Indian company Adani's giant coal mine in Queensland.

"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News A giant database, Care.data, is being set up with anonymised records to help aid medical research and the monitoring of performance. But Healthwatch England said the way NHS England had tried to explain the system had been confusing. NHS England said privacy concerns were misplaced. The central database - to be launched after April - will enable experts to assess diseases, examine new drugs on the market and identify infection outbreaks as well as monitor the care patients get. Information is already available about what happens in hospitals, but to date it has been difficult to link those records with the information that was available about what is happening to patients when they are under the care of GPs. However, concerns have been raised about the prospect of keeping all of the information in one place, with campaigners saying that it could lead to privacy problems and data breaches. There is a proposal - to be discussed next month - which could give access to non-NHS bodies, including private firms. Healthwatch England chair Anna Bradley said nearly a quarter of the 148 local Healthwatch groups had been in contact to raise concerns about the scheme in recent days. It comes after NHS England started last month a mass mail out to every household explaining the project and giving people the chance to opt out. Not everyone has received the leaflets yet, but Ms Bradley said there had been reports of people throwing away the leaflets as they did not realise what they were, struggling to understand what they were about and cases where GPs have decided to opt out all their patients themselves. Concerns Ms Bradley said: ""Once again the NHS has decided it knows best and is ploughing ahead with plans to share this data whether we like it or not. ""To make matters worse, the communications around this have been so poor that we are now in the situation where all of us are about to be automatically opted in to a scheme we know little or nothing about. ""While we recognise that sharing the data could be of significant benefit to researchers, the NHS has a moral duty to consult with all of us and trust us to make our own decisions."" She said Healthwatch England has now written a letter to NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson asking him to put back the roll-out of the scheme so patients could be consulted more. Dawn Monaghan, of the Information Commissioner's office, also said she had concerns. ""At the moment, we don't think it is clear enough on the website or in the information that has been sent out exactly what data is going to go and what is not going to go."" But Tim Kelsey, NHS England's national director for patients and information, said patients need not have concerns as the information would not be ""identifiable"". ""This data is stripped of all the identifiers so, for example, the name and address features nowhere on this data; postcode, numbers, the data is stripped of all the identifiers and in their place are substituted meaningless pseudonyms in order that this data can be linked with other data sets. ""Can I be categorical? No one who uses this data will know who you are.""","The roll-out of a new NHS data-sharing scheme involving medical records should be delayed as patients have been left ""in the dark"", a patient watchdog says."
"Danica Roem, a 32-year-old journalist, ousted pro-Trump incumbent Republican Bob Marshall. Mr Marshall had described himself as Virginia's ""chief homophobe"". The district that elected Ms Roem, which includes outer suburbs of Washington DC, strongly supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Ms Roem championed gay, transgender and immigrant rights during her campaign, but the race mostly focused on the state's transport infrastructure. Headlines of the night Diverse politicians chosen across the US Reasons for Republicans to worry Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Democrats finally have a victory of the non-moral kind. After coming up short in a handful of special elections across the US, they went to the polls in a battleground state and posted a huge win. How the Democrats, from governor candidate Ralph Northam on down, swept through election night in Virginia should be particularly concerning to Republicans across the US. Turnout from Democratic supporters surged. They ran up huge margins with college-educated voters and residents in the wealthy Northern Virginia suburbs. The legions of rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 were a non-factor. Democrats won legislative races that were considered to be in play only in the rosiest of Democratic wave scenarios. Exit polls show a plurality of Virginians went to the polls to send a message to Mr Trump. Their top issue was healthcare. At least in Virginia, the president's dismal approval ratings translated into ballot-box poison. The stage is now set for the midterm elections in 2018. Republicans will have a year to brace for what could be an anti-Trump tsunami forming on the horizon. What they - and Mr Trump - do next could decide their fate. Mr Marshall had a strong record of opposing equality legislation. The veteran Republican co-sponsored a 2006 Virginia constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. He also introduced a bill that would have banned transgender school students from using the bathrooms of their choice. Ms Roem is not the first openly transgender state lawmaker in the United States. Stacie Laughton won a seat in New Hampshire's legislature in 2012, but she resigned before taking office. A closeted transgender woman, Althea Garrison, won a seat in the Massachusetts legislature in 1992. Ms Garrison was later outed by a conservative newspaper. Also on Tuesday former television anchor and Democrat Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was fatally shot on-air in 2015, unseated a Republican incumbent in Virginia's House of Delegates. Mr Hurst's girlfriend, Alison Parker, and Adam Ward were killed by a former employee of their station WDBJ in Roanoke while broadcasting. A year since Trump upset the odds",Voters in the US state of Virginia have elected their first openly transgender state legislator.
"Signaller Tyler Pearson, 18, of York-based 2 Signal Regt, has not been seen since going into the river in the early hours of Thursday. Police officers are searching in and around the Ouse for the soldier. Lt Col Ian Hargreaves, from 2 Signal Regt, said Signaller Pearson's colleagues' ""thoughts and prayers"" were with his family. Police were called at about 02:30 BST on Thursday after a man was seen in the river near Ouse Bridge. Signaller Pearson was seen entering the water at King's Staith near the Lowther public house, North Yorkshire Police said. 'Bright, keen and enthusiastic' Officers believe the soldier was trying to reach the far bank of the river at Queen's Staith.

"Footfall fell by more than 80% after all but essential shops closed their doors, according to Springboard. That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations. Springboard said the April slump was a ""decline of unprecedented magnitude"". Shopping centres were the worst hit by the drop in footfall, as visits fell by 84.8%. Meanwhile, the number of visits to High Streets around the country fell by 83.3% and footfall at retail parks was 68.1% lower. The presence of supermarkets and wide-open spaces, which allowed for better social distancing, meant retail parks performed slightly better than other areas, according to the retail analyst company. Shift in consumer behaviour ""What has become clear, but what is not obvious from the headline rate, is the shift in consumer behaviour away from large towns and cities to smaller more local centres,"" said Diane Wehrle from Springboard. At 20 smaller town centres, including Harold Hill, Prescot, Kenilworth and Dudley, footfall decreased by less than 60%. Meanwhile, major city centres such as Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Bristol and London were among the 20 areas that saw the biggest drops in footfall. ""The overriding focus on safe shopping and the greater emphasis on community that has come to the fore means that trips to larger towns and cities have been curtailed,"" said Ms Wehrle. ""Indeed, it is the first evidence available that suggests how consumers may respond to easing of restrictions."" She said it was a contrast to ""pre-coronavirus days"" when small High Streets faced an increasing struggle to attract shoppers. ""The path of recovery for retail may well be led by smaller high streets which can offer both safety and community benefits. ""For larger destinations, the emphasis on safety suggests that those environments that have the capability to control shopper numbers - such as retail parks and shopping centres - will be the next phase of recovery, followed by large towns and cities which inevitably face issues around pedestrian congestion.""","The number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell at its fastest rate ever in April as the lockdown forced people to stay indoors, industry figures show."
"Earlier this year the Housing Executive terminated all its its maintenance work with the east Belfast-based company. Red Sky carried out maintenance jobs on most Housing Executive properties in the city. Nelson McCausland has now asked the executive to let the contract run for another eight weeks. The Housing Executive ended all its repair contracts with Red Sky in April after it carried out an investigation into its work practices which included allegations of over-charging. It gave the company three months notice. The contract had been worth £8m a year. Red Sky strenuously denied the allegations saying they were ""without substance"". A short time later, the contract was terminated and Red Sky went into administration. Meeting requested Some politicians including the DUP's east Belfast MLA Robin Newton expressed concern about the potential loss of 400 jobs at the company. Chris Lyttle from the Alliance Party has sought an urgent meeting with Mr McCausland over the suspension. He said: ""We have written to the social development minister on a number of occasions and requested an urgent meeting with him, a number of days ago, on behalf of workers who have at no point received sufficient information on this matter. ""I hope it will be possible to meet with the minister as soon as possible to progress this situation."" On Friday the DUP minister Mr McCausland said because of a number ongoing internal investigations at the Housing Executive, he had significant concerns about the contracts process there. He has asked the Housing Executive not to terminate its contract with Red Sky and to suspend any action to appoint alternative contractors. In response, the Housing Executive said it had received no written instructions relating to the matter. ""Our commitment to address any failures in contract management has been clearly demonstrated recently with our robust actions against contractors and staff,"" it said. ""We are committed to provide the best service for our 90,000 tenants and to ensure best value for public money. ""We will of course ensure that our maintenance service operates during the period of the investigation commissioned by the minister.""",The social development minister has asked the Housing Executive not to suspend its contract with one of its main repair contractors Red Sky.
"China ''will push forward human spaceflight projects and make new technological breakthroughs'', the report said. It plans to develop next-generation rockets, new types of satellites and carry out deep-space exploration. In the long term, China is working towards building a space station and putting a person on the moon. The white paper also summarised China's space activities since 2006 and spelt out policies for international co-operation, in a move that appeared aimed at allaying concern over its space ambitions. ''China will work together with the international community to maintain a peaceful and clean outer space and endeavour to make new contributions to the lofty cause of promoting world peace and development,'' said the report. It lists collaborations with countries such as Russia, Brazil, France and Britain. China will also ''continue to make dialogue regarding the space field'' with the US, following a NASA delegation visit in October. China views its space programme as a key part of its national development and international growth. According to the white paper, the Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 spaceships will be launched to dock with the Tiangong-1 space lab module. Tiangong-1, which means ''heavenly palace'', was launched aboard a Long March 2F rocket in September. It is a prototype module for China's future space station. Last month the Shenzhou-8 spent just under 17 days in orbit - the longest Shenzhou mission to date - and rendezvoused with the space lab. Officials have indicated that at least one of the two next Shenzhou missions would be manned and that 2012 might even see the country's first female astronaut. The white paper also said China would improve its Long March launch vehicles, building next-generation rockets that used ''non-toxic and pollutant-free propellant''. It plans to upgrade launch sites and finish a new launch base in Hainan. It will also continue building its Beidou satellite navigation system, with aims to cover the Asia-Pacific region by the end of 2012 and complete global coverage by 2020. China will also launch orbiters to survey the moon, land on it and obtain samples that can be studied. Ultimately, it wants to put a person on the moon. In the next five years, the report said, China will ''conduct studies on the preliminary plan for a human lunar landing''.",China has released a white paper setting out its space plans for the next five years.
"The plan for the 366,000 sq ft (34,000 sq m) three-storey terminal are set to be submitted in the spring. The terminal currently deals with about four million passengers annually but the airport hopes to increase numbers to seven million over 10 years. LBA said the proposal would ""support our region's economic growth"". It hopes the building could be open by 2023, the original building would operate throughout construction. The current terminal was built in 1965, the airport employs about 2,500 people and deals with about four million passengers annually. Hywel Rees, the airport's chief executive, said: ""This proposal is not about growing beyond our predicted capacity, it is about meeting the same demand in a more efficient way, with a smaller environmental footprint."" The airport wanted a building ""better placed to support our region's economic growth"", he added. Analysis Spencer Stokes, BBC Look North transport correspondent It's less than a year since a government minister and council leaders donned hard hats to mark the start of work on a £12m terminal extension at Leeds Bradford Airport. But within a couple of months those first stages of construction had stopped. The airport's new chief executive Hywell Rees scrutinised the plans and decided that a completely new approach was needed. He went back to the airport's owners, AMP Capital, and negotiated a £150m investment in a brand new terminal building. Situated to the east of the current 1960s base, the building is planned to be one of the most environmentally-efficient airport terminals in the country. It'll also help the airport hit its target of seven million passengers by 2030. It's 12 years since Leeds Bradford Airport was sold off by Leeds and Bradford councils in the hope that a private company would invest some serious capital. That is now happening - but at time when questions are being asked about air travel and its environmental impact. Henri Murison, from the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the plans were ""crucial and form a key part of the wider Northern Powerhouse and national aviation strategy."" An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said: ""Despite saying the plans won't result in increased passengers, it seems likely it actually would. ""Often the number of flights do increase when work is undertaken."" The plan is subject to approval but has received backing from Paul Maynard, the minister responsible for aviation. It is to be privately funded by AMP Capital, LBA's owners, and replaces a scheme that received consent in January 2019. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"City councillors backed the scheme at a meeting earlier. It will now go before the secretary of state. English Heritage said the city council had ""significantly downplayed the adverse impacts of the development on Liverpool's outstanding heritage"". Unesco inspectors had warned approval could lead to the removal of the city from its list of World Heritage Sites. 'Vote of confidence' TheLiverpool Waters planning applicationincludes a cruise liner terminal, thousands of apartments and the tallest UK building outside London. Bidders Peel Developments said the scheme could create up to 20,000 jobs. Joe Anderson, leader of Labour-run Liverpool City Council, said the decision was ""one of the most significant and far-reaching made in Liverpool's recent history"" and ""a vote of confidence in a new beginning of a great city"". The application will now be referred to the secretary of state for communities and local government who will decide if it requires a public inquiry. Lindsey Ashworth, Peel development director, said: ""The scheme that we've put forward is the result of all the discussions we've had with English Heritage. ""Unless we move on with the scheme we've got now, we'd be talking for the next 10 years. ""Of course I'm bothered about it [World Heritage status], I just don't believe it will ever be lost. ""The reasons I made the changes to the scheme was to make sure we preserved the World Heritage Status. ""This is as far as I want to go and I want the government on-side. I think the government will say this is fine."" Liverpool was awarded World Heritage status in 2004, ranking the city alongside the Taj Mahal and Stonehenge. A report by Unesco inspectors, who visited the city in November to investigate the impact of the development, suggested it would leave the area ""irreversibly damaged"" and cause a ""serious loss of historical authenticity"". In a statement, English Heritage said: ""If the scheme in its current form goes ahead, in our view the setting of some of Liverpool's most significant historic buildings will be severely compromised, the archaeological remains of parts of the historic docks are at risk of destruction and the city's historic urban landscape will be permanently unbalanced."" Richard Kemp, deputy leader of Liverpool Liberal Democrats, said: ""Liverpool must now act swiftly to mediate between Peel and Unesco. ""Liverpool needs both the new development and heritage status."" Mr Anderson said the council had put in safeguards which could see the development ""living comfortably alongside the World Heritage Site"". He continued: ""If this application had been rejected then we would have been left with huge stretches of derelict dockland cheek-by-jowl with our World Heritage site. ""Instead we now have the prospect of one of the most ambitious schemes ever seen in this country taking shape - it is one that will transform Liverpool's fortunes for future generations.""",A £5.5bn waterfront development which could put Liverpool's World Heritage Site status at risk has been approved.
"Sam Rainsy had planned to return to lead the people's ""fight for a better life,"" describing Prime Minister Hun Sen as ""a brutal dictator"". The country's authoritarian leader has ruled Cambodia since 1985. Mr Rainsy's party has been dissolved as part of a crackdown on the opposition and he has been in Paris in exile. ""I am extremely shocked because the people need me in Cambodia,"" Mr Rainsy said at Charles de Gaulle airport after he was turned away at the Thai Airways counter. He intended to fly to Bangkok and then reach Cambodia, but he claimed the check-in desk ""said they have received from very high up the instruction not to allow me to board"". He vowed to get another flight and stick to his plan to make it to Cambodia by Saturday, the country's independence day. Hun Sen said Mr Rainsy would be arrested should he try to enter the country. He also asked neighbouring countries to bar him from transiting, and advised airlines to not accept him as a passenger. On Thursday, Malaysia briefly detained Mr Rainsy's deputy Mu Sochua, vice-president of his outlawed party, who hoped to join him in Cambodia. Cambodia's efforts to stop the opposition politicians returning was condemned by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The US embassy in Phnom Penh said the move represented ""an escalation in suppression of the political opposition"". Who is Sam Rainsy? Mr Rainsy is one of Cambodia's leading opposition figures but he has been living in Paris since 2015. He faces several lawsuits at home which his supporters say are all politically motivated. His Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) was for some time seen as the biggest threat to Prime Minister Hun Sen's rule. It was dissolved in 2017 by the Supreme Court, based on a complaint from the government that it was conspiring with the US to overthrow it. Over the past years, many of the party leadership have fled abroad to escape alleged political persecution. In 2017, fellow CNRP leader Kem Sokha was jailed in Phnom Penh on charges branded as political; after one year he was released on bail but has been under house arrest since. After Mr Rainsy announced his intent to return, Cambodia arrested dozens of opposition figures within the country. Is it realistic for Mr Rainsy to return? It's hard to see a way for him to make it into Cambodia. The government in Phnom Penh said it would arrest him and has asked all regional neighbours to bar him from entering. Hun Sen also sent troops to the border with Thailand to stop Mr Rainsy or his deputy from taking a land route. Observers also doubt whether Mr Rainsy really wants to return. ""Sam Rainsy is still very popular in Cambodia,"" Virak Ou, political analyst in Phnom Penh told the BBC, explaining that Cambodian politics is polarised between Hun Sen and Mr Rainsy. ""But this might just be a stunt to get attention. Sam Rainsy would never seriously want to come here just to be arrested."" Mr Ou said the actual goal might be to provoke the Cambodian government ""to react in a way that will prevent any compromise between Cambodia and the European Union"". The EU is currently deciding whether to introduce trade sanctions in reaction to Cambodia's increasingly authoritarian leadership. ""This would be in line with Mr Rainsy's strategy which has been consistent over the past years: to try to merit some form of international intervention,"" Mr Ou said. Who runs Cambodia? The country has been ruled by current Prime Minister Hun Sen for more than three decades. He was initially credited with economic growth and peace after the devastation caused by the Khmer Rouge regime, which was responsible for some of the worst mass killings of the 20th Century. But he is increasingly seen as an authoritarian figure who does not tolerate real political challenge. When his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) looked like it might lose the 2018 general election, the government accused the opposition of attempting a coup and had it banned, making the Cambodia effectively a one-party state under the CPP. Hun Sen shows no signs of wanting to relinquish power. Elections are held every five years - and Hun Sen has vowed he will stay in power for at least another two terms. Cambodia - a timeline Read more",Cambodia's self-exiled opposition leader - who vowed to return home this weekend - has said he was barred from checking-in for a flight from Paris.
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Amid the pomp and poetry-quoted it highlighted the transformation in British-Irish relations - a reconciliation built on the foundations of the Northern Ireland peace process. But now with Brexit straining those relations and the centenary of Irish independence looming at a time of changing demographics in Northern Ireland it is inevitable that Ireland's first citizen will have to devote more time and attention to north-south and east-west matters - if only symbolically. Like the Queen, the role of Irish president is mostly symbolic and doesn't tend to be involved in daily politics. During the state visit he spoke of the two nations in Irish as ""ar scáth a chéile"" - living in each other's shadow and shelter. And in his 2018 campaign literature he said that the ""Presidency can play a crucial role in sustaining positive relationships between our peoples at a time of political uncertainty"". It is likely that as the state commemorates its centenary he will emphasise the importance of respect, honesty and inclusion. ""The coming years will require thought and understanding as we reflect on some of the most challenging and difficult periods in our history,"" he wrote. At home he is likely to endorse the values of equality, inclusivity and a society of strong and stable communities. Michael D Higgins, a politician, poet and academic, was elected President of Ireland in 2011 at a time when the country was at a low ebb after an EU-IMF bailout resulting from a property-related banking crash. Uncertainty looms Since then the country's fortunes have dramatically reversed and with it its self-confidence. President Higgins has alluded to that during the campaign. In the next seven years the only certainty is uncertainty where British-Irish relations are concerned. Michael D Higgins will have to find fitting words and gestures as the two states meander in new and different directions.",The highlight of President Higgins' first term in office was the first state visit to the United Kingdom in 2014.

"The teacher said he had been attacked while alone in a classroom in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. But prosecutors said he had wounded himself with a box cutter and was now being questioned as to why he lied. France remains on high alert following the terror attacks in Paris on 13 November that left 130 people dead. The 45-year-old teacher - who has not been named - has been treated in hospital for superficial wounds to his side and neck. According to his account, a man had attacked him with a box cutter at about 07:10 (06:10 GMT) on Monday and had shouted: ""This is for Daesh [Islamic State]. It's a warning"". The incident sparked a manhunt in the northern suburb, as police tried to track down the alleged attacker. The anti-terrorism branch of the Paris prosecutor's office also opened an investigation for attempted murder in relation to a terrorist act. Earlier on Monday, Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem visited the scene and vowed to increase security at French schools. All classes at the Jean-Perrin preschool were cancelled. Mayor of Aubervilliers Pascal Beaudet said it was not yet known what had motivated the teacher to lie. He said the teacher had 20 years' experience and was ""appreciated"" by parents at the school. Last month, the Islamic State's French-language magazine Dar-al-Islam recently urged followers to kill teachers in France, describing them as ""enemies of Allah"" for teaching secularism. Rachel Schneider, of the French primary school teachers' union SNUipp, said many teachers had been alarmed by the threat. ""We have received many calls from colleagues, who are very worried,"" she said.

"By Alan SoadyPolitical correspondent, BBC News He told the House of Lords his party ""did not feel like being trumped"" over creating a fast north-south link by the Tories, then in opposition. Lord Mandelson said he now thought there was ""flimsy evidence"" to back the multi-billion-pound project. But the government insists it will boost the UK economy. HS2 is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033. The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock. Gordon Brown's government debated the issue before deciding in favour. 'Ardent' Lord Mandelson said: ""Frankly, there was too much of the argument that if everyone else has got a high-speed train we should have one too... We didn't feel like being trumped by the then opposition's support for the high-speed train. We wanted, if anything, to upstage them."" Lord Mandelson was a keen supporter of HS2 when he was in government, but earlier this year suggested the project should be scrapped. He told the Lords that Labour's front bench was right to have become ""more sceptical"", adding: ""I have been an ardent pro-railway supporter all my adult life. But it is precisely for that reason that I do not support HS2. ""I think the sheer cost of it will suck the very life blood out of the rest of the country's rail system."" The Labour peer said Sir Rod Eddington's report on transport in 2006 had been forgotten. It had ""firmly rejected"" HS2 and concluded that a ""wide range of incremental improvements"" would be better. He also said HS2 was a ""political trophy project justified on flimsy evidence to be about modernity and prosperity"". But Liberal Democrat Lord Greaves had backed the project as ""sensible, necessary and long overdue"". He said the rail scheme would herald a new era for Britain's railways and help close the ""regional divide"". And Labour former minister Lord Rooker hit back at Lord Mandelson's criticism of HS2, saying: ""The Labour government started this project and it will be inconceivable to withdraw support. ""I am getting cheesed-off listening to ex-ministers swanning around the political salons pouring cold water on this project."" In response to Lord Mandelson's comments, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister's position on HS2 is well stated. We need to invest in high-speed rail in this country. ""It is essential for solving the capacity crisis and research from KPMG has shown there could be a £15bn annual boost to the economy. ""The prime minister is clear in his support for HS2 and wants the process to go on and the railway to be built.""","Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has said Labour originally approved the High Speed Two rail project to ""upstage"" the Conservatives."
"By Russell HottenBBC News, New York ""I'll make the first order,"" the Republican Senate majority leader promised if Nike changes its mind. The special-edition Fourth-of July trainer features an old US flag that some people say has racist overtones. Mr McConnell said ""I think we've got a problem"" if some ""Americans find the American flag controversial"". The sportswear giant withdrew the trainer, featuring the Revolutionary War-era Betsy Ross flag, following complaints that it represented an era of slavery. Although the origins and meaning are disputed, the flag was adopted by the American Nazi Party and other extremist groups. Sportsman, activist and Nike-sponsored Colin Kaepernick was widely reported as one of those who said it was inappropriate, although he has yet to comment publicly. Nike's decision sparked a huge backlash from conservative America and the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, ordered the cancellation a $1m grant to help the company build a factory in the state. Speaking in Kentucky, Mr McConnell told reporters: ""I hope Nike either releases these shoes or some other shoe maker picks up the flag, puts it on a pair of shoes and starts selling it. I'll make the first order. ""If we're in a political environment where the American flag has become controversial to Americans, I think we've got a problem."" The heels of the trainers were decorated with the flag, known for its circular arrangement of 13 stars representing the 13 original colonies of the US. The shoes, which had already been shipped to retailers, are selling on the StockX online marketplace for more than $2,000. Nike has asked retailers to return the stock. Texas Senator Ted Cruz also dismissed Nike's move as unpatriotic, writing in a series of tweets that the shoe giant ""only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag"". ""Yep, I own lots of @Nike I've been a life-long customer, since I was kid. But they've now decided their shoes represent snide disdain for the American flag,"" he said. ""Since they don't want my business anymore, I wont buy any more."" In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal said that ""no flag of the United States is a symbol of oppression and racism"" and that the row was ""another sign of our current political insanity"". But social media was equally full of comments backing Nike and criticising the firm for thinking the flag was appropriate. Last year Mr Kaepernick, a former NFL star, became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan. The former American football quarterback had previously sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest against police violence against African-Americans. US President Donald Trump said he had shown ""disrespect"" to the US flag. Many consumers said they would never buy Nike again after it adopted Mr Kaepernick, and social media featured pictures of people burning their trainers. But in the following three months, Nike reported a rise in sales. Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at the research and consultancy group NPD, said Nike would probably also find support among its core consumers this time. ""I think it's important to understand who Nike's core demographic is here. They're really focused on teens and looking at the commentary on Twitter and so forth, I don't see a lot of teens coming out with a negative attitude here,"" he said.","US political heavyweight Mitch McConnell has waded into the ""racist trainer"" row with a call for Nike to reverse a decision to halt sales."
"Alcoholic mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton is being sentenced for the manslaughter of her four-year-old Hamzah Khan. His mummified remains were found in squalid conditions at their Bradford home in 2011, 21 months after he died. The judge is hearing submissions from the prosecution and defence before he decides Hutton's sentence. The court is also hearing details of the involvement with the family of agencies including social services and the police. Tariq Khan, one of Hutton's two adult sons, has admitted preventing the burial of Hamzah's body and will also be sentenced later. Packed courtroom The judge, Roger Thomas, the Recorder of Bradford, heard Khan told police during interviews that his mother had threatened to kill her other children to prevent him from calling the authorities after Hamzah's death. Tariq also told probation officers how his mother held a knife to the throat of one of the children two days after Hamzah's death. He also said his mother threatened to burn down the house, the court heard. The judge was told that one of Hutton's neighbours alerted social services to her concerns about the family in March 2011, but her actions did not result in Hamzah's body being found. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the woman had observed children crying and not being comforted, threatening voices towards the children, blinds never being open and children not playing outside. In a text message the woman wrote about her anonymous call to social services, she wrote: ""Better to be safe than sorry."" Mr Greaney told the judge the history of what happened after this was ""complex"", but social services, education services and the police ""were all involved to a greater or lesser extent"". He said a serious case review into Hamzah's death was under way. The prosecutor said whatever was or was not done by the relevant agencies ""should not detract from the shocking and disgraceful conduct of Amanda Hutton involving six of her children"". ""She killed Hamzah, no-one else,"" he said. BBC Look North reporter Dave Edwards said the interest in the case was such that the courtroom was ""so full that security guards have been drafted in and people are being turned away"". Hutton is being sentenced for manslaughter, child neglect and preventing the burial of Hamzah's body. The child neglect charges relate to each of Hamzah's five siblings living at the house, who were aged between five and 13 in 2011.","A mother who allowed her four-year-old son to starve to death told his older brother not to tell anyone or she would kill his siblings, a judge has heard."
"The Chesterfield striker, 27, was cleared of rape at retrial last month. Accusers do not normally have to disclose sexual history details to defence barristers, but the Court of Appeal said this case was exceptional. Home Office minister Baroness Williams said concerns ""should be looked at and we intend to deal with it"". In 2012, Mr Evans was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, the previous year. He served half of a five-year prison term. That conviction was quashed on appeal in April and he was found not guilty of the same charge at the subsequent retrial after details of the complainant's sexual history were heard in court. Baroness Williams told peers on Tuesday this was only permitted when ""a strict set of criteria are met"". She added: ""We are aware of the recent concern about the admissibility of a complainant's sexual history and wider perceptions about the law."" Lady Justice Hallett ruled Mr Evans's was a ""rare"" case in which it would be appropriate to allow ""forensic examination"" of the woman's sexual behaviour. Mr Evans, a former Wales international who was capped 13 times, always denied having sex with the woman while she was too drunk to consent. He insisted she had agreed to let him ""join in"" while she was having consensual sex with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, 27 - who was cleared of rape at the original trial - after a night out in Rhyl. At Mr Evans's retrial, two other men said the complainant used similar phrases during sex to those the defence said were used when she had sex with Mr Evans and Mr McDonald. Section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 imposes tight restrictions on details of an alleged victims' sexual past being presented in court, other than in exceptional circumstances. Calls for a report into the operation of the legislation were made during the committee stage of the Policing and Crime Bill in the House of Lords. Lord Marks, a Liberal Democrat peer and QC, said: ""The point here and the point that we seek to have reviewed is whether, as a result of the Ched Evans case, there might be cases where the restrictive nature of Section 41 has or may be watered down and we need to look at how its operating. ""It is very important that rape gets reported and it is very important that the legislation in place is certainly as restrictive as we always thought Section 41 was and as the textbooks say it is. ""And the public concern is that this case seems to have weakened that protection.""",The law protecting alleged rape victims from disclosing details of their sex lives will be reviewed in the wake of Wales footballer Ched Evans's case.

"Wolverhampton-based Care Avenues Limited could be barred from operating if it fails to improve within six months, inspectors warned. The Care Quality Commission [CQC] found low numbers of qualified staff was one factor putting people at risk, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The company said it had addressed concerns since an inspection in March. An overall rating of inadequate has been given by the CQC and the service has been placed in special measures. The commission highlighted a number of other areas it said placed people at risk. This includes unsafe care and treatment, because of inadequate assessments of care needs, and people not receiving medicine. Inspectors criticised standards of care and effectiveness and found records were not up to date and could not be easily accessed. The commission also revealed that, since making local authorities aware of its findings, two councils have suspended placing new contracts with Care Avenues Limited. A report said if the company was still rated inadequate in any key area in six months, it would start enforcement action to stop it operating its care services. Refusing to comment directly on the commission's findings, a company spokeswoman said she was confident the CQC would find improvements in follow-up inspections. Director Sania Shah said since the inspection, the company had addressed concerns and was hopeful of a good report in future.",A company caring for elderly people in their homes has been labelled unsafe and inadequate by a watchdog.

"By Kate DaileyBBC News Magazine According to the MacArthur Foundation, annual fellowships are awarded to outstanding individuals who show talent, originality, and dedication in all fields. They must also be citizens of, or resident in, the United States. But due to a popular nickname, the fellows are known by a much grander moniker - genius. The winners of the genius grants, as they're often called in the media, reflect the Foundation's broader goals. While some fellows fit the traditional idea of a genius - philosophers, physicists, composers - the grants have also gone to community organisers, journalists, and educators. For those awarded the fellowship, the $500,000, no-strings -attached prize money is much more valuable than the honorific, a mantle most winners shrug off. ""It's a joke. Do you think if you met Plato, you would have called him a genius? If you met Socrates, would you have called him a genius?"" says Ved Metha, a writer who won the award in 1982. The disdain some winners have for the title ""genius"" is both a mix of humility and a sense that the true geniuses are far ahead of their time. ""When people are doing something that's really innovative, it's not recognised for a long time,"" says former fellow Richard A Muller, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Most people think you're just wasting your time."" Unfathomable insight To call oneself a genius seems like a boast. It invites unflattering comparisons to other canonic geniuses and endless opportunities for people to point out your failings. ""It's the irony between someone getting a grant for being a genius in the popular mind and the fact that any human being is likely to have done a number of stupid things,"" says Dirk Obbink, a professor at the University of Oxford and 2001 fellow. Regardless of how uncomfortable it may make people, ""genius"" is still an often-used term. ""When people use the word 'genius,' it comes out of a mostly good place,"" says David Shenk, author of The Genius In All Of Us: New Insights Into Genetics, Talent, and IQ. ""They're really just admiring the tremendous and almost unfathomable insight or ability or aesthetic, or whatever other skill that someone else has that seems so far removed from their own ability."" The word does, however, have a slightly dangerous connotation. ""A lot of people use the word genius as a way to say these people were born geniuses, they have this amazing stuff inside and aren't they lucky,"" he says. ""That's really far from where greatness comes from."" This tendency to conflate ""genius"" with ""gifted"" can be especially dangerous for children, who have yet to learn lessons about failure and resilience. Calling child prodigies ""geniuses"" may be very damaging. ""These people end up not taking risks any more, they end up sticking to what they're good at and what people are praising them for,"" says Mr Shenk. ""The real path to being extraordinary is risk taking and a willingness to fail. A lot of kids who are labelled prodigies early on end up being mediocre or worse,"" he says. The freedom factor For successful adults, being called a genius doesn't have the same dangerous effect - in part because they know that hard work, not lofty titles, are the key to greatness. ""In my family, it became sort of a family joke, because I don't exactly pass for a genius in my family and life,"" says Robert Darnton, history professor, director of the Harvard University library, and former MacArthur fellow. ""I don't think my colleagues took it too seriously."" More important than the mantle of ""genius"", he says, was the ability to turn down teaching work to focus on his research. ""The idea of taking people of promise and allowing them to take risks is a rather good idea,"" he says. ""In my life, it made a tremendous difference."" Giving people the freedom and security to try new things, rather than declaring them brilliant, is one of the best ways to incubate genius-like ideas and execution, says Mr Shenk. Still, calling these men and women geniuses may have some positive effects. ""Society at large doesn't really understand the intricacies of whale echo-location or French medieval history,"" says Charles Bigelow, a type historian, professor, and designer who received the award in 1982. Labelling such work the output of geniuses, however, gives the public a reason to take note. ""It gives our society a way to label it, to graph it and understand it,"" he says. ""It's a useful term - maybe not for the fellows, but for society."" Plus, as far as name-calling goes, you could do a lot worse. ""It enhances one's credibility,"" says Billie Jean Young, the artist in residence at Judson college and a 1991 recipient. ""You probably already thought you were pretty smart, but it's nice to have it affirmed.""","The annual awarding of MacArthur Foundation grants means that another 22 people are going to find themselves called ""genius"". But is the title a blessing or a curse?"
"The bodies of Ceri Fuller, 35, his son Sam, 12, and daughters Rebecca, eight, and Charlotte, seven, from Gloucestershire, were found on Monday. Post-mortem tests are expected to be carried out on Mr Fuller's body later. Forensic teams have almost completed work at the quarry at Poles Coppice, Pontesbury Hill, near Shrewsbury. Det Chief Insp Neil Jamieson, from West Mercia Police, said post-mortem examinations had revealed all the children died from stab injuries. Mr Jamieson said he hoped the area could be released from police control and reopened to the public later on Wednesday or on Thursday morning.

"A ban on imports of GcMAF imposed last month has been widened to include any product which contains it or ""purports to contain it"". But the island's border agency has said it may issue licenses to import the drug ""in appropriate circumstances"". The ban was prompted by a public health warning issued after a factory in Cambridge was inspected. Peter Knee, from the Guernsey Border Agency, said import licences for individuals would only be issued with the approval of the Health and Social Services Department (HSSD), or the Home Departments. ""In practical terms the amendment does not alter the current position with regard to anyone desiring to import GcMAF, or any product containing GcMAF,"" he said. ""Such importation remains prohibited, unless an import licence is obtained."" GcMAF It is understood the drug is produced in about 10 factories around the world - with the Cambridge plant the only one in the UK. Before the import ban David Noakes, boss of producers Immuno Biotech, supplied GcMAF to island residents free of charge. The company's website claims it can be used to treat a range of conditions including cancer, HIV and autism. Ed Freestone, chief pharmacist for HSSD, said: ""All known sources of local supplies were originating in the UK and were marked as First Immune product according to information that was available."" He said the change in law provided ""a greater degree of clarity as to how the import of GcMAF is controlled"". Mr Freestone said: ""By specifically listing GcMAF products as 'prohibited imports', the authorities remain able, in appropriate circumstances, to consider a proposal to import this product from an alternative source.""","The importation of an unlicensed cancer treatment into Guernsey could resume if a ""safe supply"" is found."
"By James BadcockMadrid But after a call from Ms Ismail's father, the two set out on on a trip which they say involved death threats, escape across international borders, and a spell in a Turkish jail where, Ms Ismail says, the treatment was ""unexpected, inhumane and horrible"". 'Tricked' Safe in Ms Rico's Spanish hometown of Torrox, the couple faced the cameras to reveal a nightmarish three-week ordeal which, according to Ms Rico, began after her partner's family in Dubai had tried to separate them by force. ""I really want to tell our story because I think it could help many people who live in a situation of repression for being homosexual,"" Ms Rico told reporters who had gathered in the room to hear their story. It had all started innocently enough. According to the 28-year-old, the couple flew from London to Dubai on 14 April because Ms Ismail's father had said that her mother was ill in hospital. ""But it was a trick,"" said Jimena Rico. ""He threatened to kill us and said we could go to jail for being lesbians."" According to her partner, 21-year-old Ms Ismail was locked up by her family. But the couple managed to escape and flew to Tbilisi, Georgia, from where they were hoping to catch a connecting flight to London. But even putting more than 2,000 miles between them and Ms Ismail's family had not guaranteed their safety. Ms Ismail's father appeared at the airport and the Egyptian woman's papers, including the visa she needed to return to the UK, were torn up in the altercation. Ms Rico explained that at this point the Georgian authorities escorted the couple to the Turkish border. Spain's foreign ministry says the couple were then arrested in Samsun, northern Turkey, and taken to Istanbul. There, they were arrested on a charge ""apparently to do with terrorism"", says Ms Rico, adding that they signed papers they did not understand. Ms Rico got word to her family, who reported the situation to the Spanish police. After three days in a Turkish jail, the Spanish foreign ministry managed to secure their release - allowing them to fly home to Spain, where Ms Rico's relieved family welcomed them with open arms. ""I thought we were not going to get out of [prison],"" Ms Rico said. ""They told me I could leave but she had to stay, and I said I wasn't going without her."" Ms Ismail's father, however, tells a different version of events, although he admits travelling to Tbilisi airport and forcibly attempting to retain his daughter. ""When she arrived in Dubai, I embraced her,"" the unnamed father told Spain's Antena 3 television station. ""She said she wanted to stay in London and I asked her to come home and talk about her being a lesbian because she told us via text message. She came out of the closet like that, sending her mother a text message."" Ms Ismail's father said that he offered to take his daughter to a psychologist and that she had agreed to stay in Dubai and study there. Then, he claimed, his daughter vanished from the family home. ""I went to the police after she had disappeared. A friend told me Shaza was in Georgia and I reported that she had run away or been kidnapped."" He explained that he had gone to Tbilisi with a lawyer, but insisted the only papers he had torn up were part of an old passport belonging to his daughter. Jimena Rico accepts her partner's father is doing what he thinks is best: ""I know that [Ms Ismail's] father loves her. But his mind is so closed that he can't understand."" She is now hoping to marry Shaza Ismail, currently staying with her on a temporary visa after the Spanish government secured the couple's release.","Less than a month ago, Spaniard Jimena Rico, and Egyptian-born Shaza Ismail were just like any other young, gay couple in London, the city where their romance blossomed."
"Sabeen Mehmud was shot dead as she drove home with her mother, who was also attacked. Ms Mehmud had been the subject of death threats before. Tributes were paid to her on social media as soon as news of her death emerged. Ms Mehmud was a director of the charity The Second Floor, also known as T2F. T2F regularly holds seminars on human rights issues. It houses a cafe and book shop where Karachi's liberal activists and students can meet. The seminar on torture in Balochistan was held at T2F, having been cancelled by university authorities in Lahore, where it had been due to take place in the last few weeks. Taliban militants, Baloch separatists and other groups fight in Balochistan, which borders Iran. Shortly after leaving the event, Ms Mehmud and her mother were shot. Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported that Ms Mehmud died on her way to hospital, and that she had been shot five times. Dawn reported that her mother is in a critical condition in hospital. 'An extraordinary life' - by Fifi Haroon, BBC Urdu When you don't see that many people stand up, and you do, you are very likely to stand out. Sabeen knew that and went ahead and did it anyway. It's a huge thing when you have been told to call off an event, only to go ahead and do the same event in a public space, when it's so dangerous in Pakistan. It is difficult to believe someone so vibrant, so alive, so determined is gone. There is a disbelief in Pakistan, on social media and from young people. To me, she was someone who could have chosen to lead a very different, ordinary life. But she chose to lead an extraordinary life. Within an hour of the attack, tributes had started appearing on social media. Among the tributes was one from Siraj ul Haq, the head of the conservative Islamist group Jamaat-e-Islami, who tweeted: ""Murder of Sabeen Mahmud is shocking & horrific. It is extremely condemnable, indeed coward of them to target a woman."" No group has yet said it carried out the attack, though Ms Mehmud is believed to have been the subject of threats by the Pakistani Taliban in the past. Ms Mehmud set up T2F having already established a charity, PeaceNiche, in Karachi. She said she ""maxed out seven credit cards"" to keep the centre going. She also helped promote the importance of learning computer skills among Pakistani youth, and hosted hundreds of events at T2F. In a profile in a Pakistani media magazine in 2013, Ms Mehmud was asked what her superpower would be. She answered: ""I'd like to wave my magic wand and de-weaponise Karachi.""",A leading Pakistani human rights activist has been killed in a drive-by shooting in Karachi after hosting a talk on allegations of torture in the province of Balochistan.
"The warning came as he launched his World Wide Web Foundation's annual web index report, tracking global censorship. It suggests that 94% of the countries in the index do not adequately monitor government internet interception. Thirty per cent of countries block or filter political content, it indicates. The report concludes that the current legal framework on government snooping needs urgent review. ""One of the most encouraging findings of this year's web index is how the web and social media are increasingly spurring people to organise, take action and try to expose wrongdoing in every region of the world,"" said Sir Tim. ""But some governments are threatened by this, and a growing tide of surveillance and censorship now threatens the future of democracy. Bold steps are needed now to protect our fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and association online,"" he added. 'Appalling and foolish' Sir Tim has been an outspoken critic of government surveillance following the revelations from whistle-blower Edward Snowden. He described attempts by the spy agencies to crack encryption as ""appalling and foolish"". He has previously said that the checks and balances to oversee GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA), have failed. It is a view shared by digital forensic expert Professor Peter Sommer. ""GCHQ is a spying agency. It needs to produce good results. But how far anyone understands the techniques they are using is more unclear."" ""The things they are doing need a ministerial warrant but the ministers have a lot of other things to do. Did they have sufficient understanding of the technology? Who is doing the risk analysis?"" A Cabinet Office spokesperson told the BBC: ""The success of our intelligence agencies relies on secrecy. But secrecy does not mean lack of accountability. The United Kingdom's intelligence agencies operate under the tightest of controls and oversights. ""Our agencies only act in line with their strict legal mission, above all keeping people safe from harm. ""There is a triple lock to ensure every action is lawful, necessary and proportionate - interception underpinned by Ministerial warrants, world class internal controls and three safety nets of outside scrutiny by the Interception Commissioner, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and the Investigatory Powers Tribunal."" Measure of influence The report compiled by Sir Tim's World Wide Web Foundation ranks countries in terms of the social and political impact of the web. Sweden tops the annual web index, ahead of Norway, and followed by the UK, US and New Zealand. It found that in 80% of the countries studied, the web and social media played a role in mobilising the public on a range of issues. It also found that rich countries did not necessarily rank higher in the index. The Philippines, with a per-capita income of $4,410 per year, is more than 10 places ahead of Qatar, the world's richest country. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is outperformed by 10 sub-Saharan African countries, and Switzerland, the third wealthiest nation, is only one place ahead of Estonia. But in poorer countries the digital divide is growing ever more marked, according to the report. ""Ten years after world leaders committed to harnessing technology to build an inclusive information society, parents in 48% of countries can't use the web to compare school performances and budgets, women in over 60% of countries can't use the web to help them make informed choices about their bodies, and over half the population in developing countries can't use the web at all,"" said Anne Jellema, the foundation's chief executive.","Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned that the democratic nature of the net is threatened by a ""growing tide of surveillance and censorship""."
"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Hospitals are meant to see 95% of patients in four hours, but just 87.8% were, NHS England data revealed. That is a slight drop on the January figures, which were the worst since the target was introduced in 2004. And in another sign of growing A&E pressures, a unit in Lancashire is being forced to close overnight from next week because of a staffing crisis. Bosses running the Chorley A&E said they had to take the step because they did not have the doctors to staff the unit. There is a national shortage of A&E doctors and Chorley said this had been exacerbated by the national cap on agency staff which has been brought in. The cap limits the amount hospitals can pay for locum staff to no more than 55% above normal shift rates. It has been phased in since November as the government has demanded the health service curb the rising bill for agency staff, which has been cited as one of the major factors behind the deficits being racked. The Chorley unit - part of the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust - tried to apply the cap but found it could not fill its rotas. It relied heavily on locum staff because it did not have enough permanent doctors and so this month has stopped using the cap, under the emergency clause in the regulations, but still could not find the staff. There have been suggestions other trusts have got round it by paying permanent doctors extra to fill shifts. Trust medical director Prof Mark Pugh said: ""We simply cannot staff the rotas and it is an unacceptable risk to patient safety to attempt to provide an emergency service with no doctors available to see people."" Dr Cliff Mann, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said Chorley was not the only unit affected. ""A&E units rely on locums more than others because we have problems filling posts with permanent staff and we have to provide a 24/7 service. ""This is not a unique situation."" The news emerged as NHS England published its monthly performance report for February. As well as the problems in A&E, the 111 phone service, ambulances and cancer care also missed key performance targets. The 18-week target to see patients needing routine treatments, such as knee and hip operations, was met although a number of trusts did not submit data. Candace Imison, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""Today's figures are the very visible symptoms of a system facing both inexorably increasing patient numbers and severe financial strain."" NHS England's Richard Barker said the problems in A&E were also related to a later-than-normal spike in flu cases and problems hospitals were experiencing discharging patients because of problems accessing social care support in the community for vulnerable patients. ""Despite these pressures, for the year as a whole more than nine out of ten patients have been admitted, treated or discharged in under four hours, while long trolley waits have halved compared with last year,"" he added. Across the rest of the UK the four-hour target is also being missed, according to latest figures. Performance in Wales and Northern Ireland is worse than in England, while in Scotland just below 93% of patients were seen within target during February.

"Labour's Holly Lynch - who organised a letter of support to Meghan from 72 female MPs in 2019 - said voluntary regulation of the press had ""failed"". The MP said it might be ""harder to find very clear guidance"" on the issue. But she told the Guardian that, as legislators, ""we have a responsibility to intervene"". The newspaper reported that a number of MPs had made preliminary enquiries about a debate in the Commons in response to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey - covering topics such as racism in the media and mental health issues. The BBC understands that Ms Lynch has written to the MPs who signed the 2019 letter inviting them to a Zoom meeting on Friday to discuss what the next steps should be. During the interview that aired in the US on Sunday, Meghan said there had been times when she ""didn't want to be alive any more"" because she found royal life so difficult. And her husband, Prince Harry, said the UK press was one of the main reasons for the couple's relocation to California. The pair referenced the letter from Ms Lynch and other female MPs, with Harry saying: ""I guess one of the most telling parts, and the saddest parts, was over 70… female members of Parliament, both Conservative and Labour, came out and called out the colonial undertones of articles and headlines written about Meghan. ""Yet no one from my family ever said anything over those three years. And that hurts."" A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. ""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately."" The Palace added: ""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members."" Ms Lynch - the MP for Halifax - told the PA news agency: ""What we said in that letter was there's got to be an integrity to the British press, to know when something is in the public interest or when it is just tearing down a woman in public life for no reason. ""Some of that will be harder to find very clear guidance, legislation, to make sure that happens in reality, but clearly we cannot have a position where a woman in public life finds that she is feeling suicidal because of the relentless nature of the attacks on her and on her character. ""So we need to find ways that we can create that environment where a woman isn't hounded in the way that we saw Meghan Markle being hounded."" 'What next?' She said MPs take freedom of the press seriously, but added that it ""comes with a responsibility to not be engaged in relentless and aggressive bullying of a woman"". And while legislators have said ""time and time again"" that a voluntary approach to press regulation was the right way forward, Ms Lynch said: ""How long do you continue to let that fail before you have to recognise it has failed and say 'what next?'. ""We are in the very early stages of saying 'OK, what next?', because we are certainly at that point.""","An MP is calling for Parliament to consider action over the press ""hounding"" high profile women following the Duchess of Sussex's TV interview."

The group was set up to spearhead a project to turn the building, which is in the centre of the town, into a multi-functional community centre. It is thought the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on fundraising for the £500,000 project is behind the decision to abandon plans.

Mr Mile said: ""I think we have the club in a fairly sound position. ""It has been a very challenging period for Scottish football, in a very difficult environment.""","Fresh negotiations have taken place with the city council to end the impasse over Aberdeen FC's proposed new stadium, club chairman Stewart Milne has said."
"Fergus WalshMedical correspondent The announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO), was made at a meeting of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in New York. It follows Nigeria going more than a year without a case of wild - naturally occurring - polio. Three years without cases are required before it can be declared polio free. The decision means there are just two endemic countries - Pakistan and Afghanistan - where transmission of the paralysing virus has never been interrupted. Jean Gough, Unicef country representative in Nigeria, told me: ""This is an important milestone, but it is too early to celebrate. We need to continue the efforts at every level if polio is to be eradicated."" Polio is spread by poor sanitation and contaminated water and usually affects children. The virus attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis - usually of the legs - within hours. GPEI was established in 1988 when tens of thousands of children in more than 125 countries were paralysed by polio each year. Partner organisations include the WHO, Rotary International and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Challenge Nigeria's progress against polio has been hard-fought. In 2003, some northern states boycotted the oral polio vaccine for nearly a year after scare stories that it caused sterilisation. It led to the virus spreading to many countries that had been declared polio free. In 2013 nine vaccinators were shot dead in Kano. But instead of being a deterrent, it galvanised support at every level. The Nigerian government declared polio a national health emergency and greatly increased the number of vaccinators. And community and religious leaders voiced their support. As a result, the number of families refusing to have their children immunised has decreased sharply. Boko Haram The success has come despite the Islamist militant insurgency in north-east Nigeria. Earlier this month Unicef said half a million children had fled attacks by Boko Haram over the past five months. Vaccine teams have been focussing attention on displaced families who have moved elsewhere in Nigeria, as well as fleeing to neighbouring countries like Cameroon, Chad and Niger. I last visited Kano in northern Nigeria in 2005 and met Aminu Ahmed, and his son Umar - both of whom have been paralysed by polio. Like other children, Umar did not get the drops of polio vaccine and was infected, partially paralysing his right leg. His father - who runs a charity making hand-operated tricycles for polio sufferers - has become a campaigner for polio immunisation. I went back to meet the family. Umar is doing well at school and he now joins his father in persuading families to be immunised. Aminu Ahmed told me: ""Ten years ago, it was very common to see families saying no to the vaccine - now they all want it. ""We say you do not want your children to be unable to walk, like me."" Polio progress Wild polio Nigeria, like the rest of the world, is switching from the oral polio vaccine, given in two drops into the mouth, to an injectable, inactivated form of polio vaccine (IPV). The oral vaccine, which contains a weakened vaccine virus, can in extremely rare cases, cause a form of polio - circulation vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). There has been one case of cVDPV in Nigeria this year. I met the family of the last child to be infected with wild polio. Isau was 16 months old when he was infected in July 2014. His right arm lies lifeless at his side - the muscles have withered and he cannot use them. His mother, Kanduwa Ahmadu, has just given birth to another boy. She told me: ""I will make sure my baby son gets all the doses of polio vaccine he needs. I know that life will be very hard for Isau."" It's more than a year since there has been a case of wild polio in Africa. Eradicating the disease from the continent would be a huge achievement. But health officials fear a resurgence of the disease unless efforts are continued to immunise every child. India was declared polio free last year. So far this year there have been 41 cases of wild polio worldwide, compared to 200 at the same point last year.","Nigeria has been removed from the list of polio endemic countries in what is being regarded as a ""milestone"" on the quest to eradicate the disease."
"By Fiona BaileyEntertainment reporter, BBC News ""It's not very guitar hero. There isn't a guitar solo until the sixth track,"" he explains. The 44-year-old, who played lead guitar alongside his brother Liam in the band for 18 years, says his new material is very different. High Flying Birds features 10 tracks, which were recorded in London and Los Angeles over the last 18 months. There will be a tour shortly after the release of the album in October, with the opening gig in Dublin. A second as-yet-untitled collaboration with Amorphous Androgynous will follow next summer. Although the newly-married star says commercial success does not worry him, he admits he is slightly more anxious about how fans will take to his new material. ""I'm just assuming that fans of Oasis will like it because I was the main songwriter,"" he says. ""I wrote every song for that band so I'm assuming they will like some aspects of it [the new album]. ""But if it comes out and journalists slate it, it doesn't mean anything any more. With the internet, everybody is a journalist now, everybody is a critic, everybody reviews albums. ""I think they'll like it otherwise I wouldn't be putting it out."" While the London press conference was set up for Gallagher to talk about his solo career, it did not take long for reporters to ask about the state of his relationship with Liam. The pair fell out two years ago just before a gig in Paris and have not spoken since. ""I had a sweepstake on how long it would take,"" Gallagher laughs, when the first question was put to him just two minutes into the event. The guitarist explains how the brothers' row escalated after Liam cancelled their V Festival slot ""because he had a hangover"", although the official reason given at the time was that he was suffering with laryngitis. Tension only increased after Liam apparently demanded free advertising space for his clothing label in the band's tour programme. ""I didn't think it was right for him to be flogging his gear to our fans. There was a massive row about that,"" Gallagher says. 'Unnecessary violent act' ""That night Liam kind of stormed out of the dressing room. On the way out he picked up a plum and he threw it across the dressing room and it smashed against the wall,"" Gallagher explains. ""Part of me wishes it had finished like that because that would have been a great headline: 'Plum throws plum,'"" he laughs. But Gallagher's demeanour changes when he describes how the row suddenly took a turn for the worst and Liam returned wielding his guitar ""like an axe"". ""It was a real unnecessary violent act. He was swinging this guitar around and he nearly took my face off,"" Gallagher says. Just minutes before the concert was due to start the guitarist says he walked out and refused to return. But in hindsight Gallagher admits he regrets doing that. ""If I could have the time again I'd have gone back and done the gigs. I'd have done that gig and I'd have done the next one and we'd have all gone away and we could probably have discussed it. ""We may never have split up. Liam always said he'd bring down Armageddon, that's the kind of way he likes things to be. ""He doesn't like me in a violent way. I don't get on with him but he takes it to a [new] level. There's no point in being in a band with people you fight with. I kind of did everybody a favour."" Liam went on to launch his own band Beady Eye and the group released their debut album, Different Gear, Still Speeding, earlier this year. Although Gallagher says he has not heard the album in its entirety, he has read some of the reviews. ""I've got to say it's got better reviews that any of you gave our Oasis albums,"" he tells reporters. ""You can't begin to imagine how annoying that is. ""He [Liam] is probably better off without me because he's in charge. It remains to be seen if I'm better off without him.""

"By Martin BarberBBC News, Norfolk Dave Evans, from Weymouth, spent 35 days hand-cutting the 20ft by 8ft (6m by 2.5m) jigsaw, featuring 33 images of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. It will be displayed until 3 November and then auctioned for Help for Heroes. Video of the collapse has been viewed more than 110,000 times on YouTube. It is being moved on Tuesday and will be on show to the public shortly afterwards. Mr Evans said: ""The world record for an auction jigsaw is about £15,000 and I hope it will do better than that. ""I hope the picture itself will have international significance and these guys will benefit from it."" The artisan puzzle-maker, who has been hand-cutting jigsaws since 1952, said the air turned blue when the puzzle collapsed to the floor of his Brewers Quay workshop in April. ""I don't normally swear, but on this occasion an expletive came out,"" said Mr Evans. ""As it's turned out, it's probably the best thing that could have happened - everybody loves the fact it fell down."" Mr Evans and four helpers took more than 16 days to rebuild the 40,763 piece jigsaw. He now hopes it will gain him a Guinness World Record for the largest hand-cut, wooden jigsaw puzzle. ""A lot of people have commented to say I should have used glue, but it wouldn't be a jigsaw anymore if it was glued together."" Mr Evans said the auction could see the puzzle bought by a museum, hotel or cruise liner. ""It's got to go somewhere that has the space to display it. ""Maybe somebody will buy it with the aim of breaking it up and putting it back together… if they're mad.""","A 40,000 piece jigsaw record-attempt that collapsed after the final piece was put in place is to be transported to the Queen's Sandringham Estate, Norfolk, in 132 ""large"" puzzle pieces."
"The girl, known as Spozhmai, said her brother and father had beaten her, ordering her to put on a suicide vest. She was taken into protective custody in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah, after an Afghan soldier spotted her wearing the vest last Monday. Said to be about 10, she has appealed to Afghan President Hamid Karzai to put her in a new home. A presidential spokeswoman said she would only be returned to relatives if tribal elders guaranteed her safety. The girl is thought to be the sister of a prominent Taliban commander, who police say encouraged her to carry out the attack. 'Treated like a slave' She told the BBC's Newsday programme that she had been scared to carry out the attack, but that her brother had promised only her targets would die. She added that her father had ordered her to return home, but she refused to obey. ""I said: 'No, I will kill myself rather than go with you',"" she said. ""The same thing will happen again. They have told me before: 'If you don't do it this time, we will make you do it again.'"" The girl said she had not been allowed to learn to read and write. ""I did all the things at home, I cooked, I cleaned the whole house, and they would treat me badly as if I was a slave,"" Spozhmai said. In her appeal to Mr Karzai last week, the child said: ""I won't go back there. God didn't make me to become a suicide bomber. I ask the president to put me in a good place.""

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter, BBC News This year saw the best picture category expanded from five titles to 10 - a move aimed at ensuring more commercial movies, traditionally shut out of the annual awards hoopla, would make the cut. That said, this year's ceremony saw sci-fi behemoth Avatar pipped at the post by modestly budgeted Iraq drama The Hurt Locker. Will 2011 see another indie David slay another studio Goliath? It remains to be seen, though the best picture line-up may well feature a number of both. Here are the pictures we predict will be in the mix, plus the other prizes they are likely to be up for when the 2011 Academy Awards are held on 27 February. BLACK SWAN A heady blend of obsession, madness and high art, Darren Aronofsky's ballet opus is a bold departure for a critically acclaimed director surely due some Oscar attention. His follow-up to The Wrestler should also land Natalie Portman a best actress nod for her fearless turn as a ballerina driven to extremes after she wins the lead in Swan Lake. Barbara Hershey is in with a shot as well, her forceful portrayal of Portman's domineering mother is sure to get her a nomination for best supporting actress. It is possible, though, the movie's high-brow subject matter and operatic excesses might be a turn-off for some Academy members. Boxing movies tend to do well come Oscar time. Rocky, Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby are just a few to have enjoyed knock-out success in the past. This certainly augurs well for David O Russell's gritty biopic of US welterweight Micky Ward - a pet project for actor Mark Wahlberg he spent five years bringing to the screen. Wahlberg's lead performance may not be showy enough to earn him a shot at the best actor title. His film, though, has a decent chance in the supporting categories. Christian Bale - who lost 30 lb (13.6 kg) to play Wahlberg's crack addict half-brother Dicky - is a virtual shoo-in for a nomination. And Melissa Leo - who rose to prominence in 2009 thanks to her surprise best actress nomination for Frozen River - is also a strong contender for her role as Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Christopher Nolan's audacious fantasy thriller was both a critical darling and a box-office smash when it opened in July. Such a combination could prove hard to resist when the members of the Academy Motion Picture Arts and Pictures come to cast their votes. Inception should also get a slew of nominations in technical categories, though it is unlikely any of its cast members will be so fortunate. Nolan should be in with a shout though, especially after his Batman film The Dark Knight failed to land a best picture nod in 2009. That snub is thought to have been one of the main reasons why the number of nominated candidates was doubled the following year. This story of a lesbian couple whose family is unsettled by the return of their sperm donor is a winning combination of comedy, drama and social commentary. Same-sex marriage and gay parenting are hot-button topics in the US, dealt with both sensitively and provocatively in Lisa Cholodenko's film. Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo are all in the running for acting nods, with Bening in particular a decent bet for the best actress statuette. Cholodenko might also get shortlisted for best director, though her chances of winning the best original screenplay prize are probably stronger. This elegant period piece - an impeccably mounted costume drama about the British monarchy - is the kind of movie Academy voters love. As the US media's recent coverage of Prince William's engagement showed, there is a huge fascination with the Royal family that can only boost the chances of Tom Hooper's film. Colin Firth missed out on a best actor prize earlier this year for A Single Man. Come February, though, his touching turn as stammering ruler George VI should sweep him to Oscar glory. Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter may also have something to celebrate should they receive supporting actor nominations for their roles as his eccentric speech therapist and the future Queen Mother respectively. Danny Boyle stormed the Oscars in 2009 with Slumdog Millionaire. Could he replicate that success with his follow-up feature? That entirely depends on the Academy's stomach for a real-life story of survival against the odds with a harrowing and grisly resolution. James Franco is surely due a best actor nod for his role as a climber forced to take drastic action after his arm becomes trapped by a falling rock. Yet while Boyle's mastery of his medium is hard to ignore, voters might feel he has already been more than amply rewarded. David Fincher's account on the origins of Facebook was the most talked-about film of the year. Critics lined up to shower it with praise. Small wonder it is considered one of the strongest contenders for next year's best picture award. Fincher will be up for best director, of that there is no doubt. Aaron Sorkin's inclusion in the adapted screenplay line-up is also a cast-iron certainty. Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and a certain Justin Timberlake may also be in the running in one or more acting categories. As hip, literate and topical as The Social Network is, however, some have found it a somewhat alienating experience. And the fact there isn't anyone to root for in this tale of back-stabbing and double-crossing might put voters off. No such problem exists with the other front-runner, an animated sequel that brings Pixar's computer-animated franchise to a heartfelt, emotional and very entertaining conclusion. No animated film has ever won the best picture Oscar, and only two - Beauty and the Beast and last year's Up - have previously been nominated for one. Some believe, however, that animation's time has come and that the genre can no longer be ghettoised in the animated feature category it was rather apologetically gifted in 2001. Could history be made next February? Disney thinks so, having planned a huge promotional campaign on Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear's behalf. Joel and Ethan Coen were the toast of the 2008 Academy Awards with No Country for Old Men and got a surprise best picture nod this year for A Serious Man. It is hardly surprising, then, that their remake of the 1969 John Wayne western is being bandied about as a best picture hopeful. Having finally won an Oscar in March, Jeff Bridges has probably just an outside chance of a nomination for his interpretation of one-eyed marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn. Yet Matt Damon - a best supporting actor also-ran this year - could find himself up for the same award for his performance as a Texas Ranger on an outlaw's trail. Buzz is also building around newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, said to be excellent as a young girl seeking to avenge her father's death. Some believe Mike Leigh's mordant comedy drama Another Year has a chance of a best picture nod. Yet we suspect it will be pushed out of the running by another lauded independent made with limited means. The critics loved Debra Granik's atmospheric tale of a young woman whose dogged attempts to locate her missing father raise the hackles of her remote rural community. Leading lady Jennifer Lawrence, meanwhile, could land a best actress citation at the expense of more established talents. Are we correct? Find out when the Academy Award nominations are announced on 25 January.","With the Academy Awards just three months away, speculation is mounting about which films will be in the frame."
"Every month dozens of bikes are dumped and left at train stations. Southern used to sell them at auction, but now donates them to organisations which make them roadworthy, and find new homes for them. Last year 103 refurbished bikes were donated to NHS workers, this year four new charities in the South East will receive about 90 bikes each. The Sussex Community Development Association (SCDA) in Newhaven has already received 25 bikes. The SCDA teaches bike repair skills to unemployed people and gives them work experience. Those who take part also go away with a bike of their own. Paul Horta-Hopkins, bike technician at the charity, said: ""It's not necessarily about training these people to become bike mechanics, but about being reliable and able to take instruction - skills to help them get back into work."" Chichester-based Stonepillow is another charity set to benefit. It will refurbish the bikes and sell them to help fund its work supporting homeless and vulnerable people. Hove-based YMCA DownsLink works to prevent youth homelessness and its residents will learn to restore the bikes for their own use. Cycling UK's Brixton workshop will use the bikes to provide healthy transport to people on low incomes. Bikes are usually left at the station to be picked up by their owners for two weeks. Cycles not claimed are removed to a distribution centre in Horsham where they are kept for a further six weeks in case their owners come forward. Southern also contacts the British Transport Police to confirm they have not been stolen. Angie Doll, managing director for Southern and Gatwick Express, said: ""It's fantastic to be working with all our partners, not only to promote healthy, green transport by extending the life of previously unwanted bikes, but to support these charities who are providing truly life-changing support for the most vulnerable and marginalised people in our communities.""

Dorset Police said the fire was still ""unexplained"" and appealed for information and dashcam footage. Firefighters are likely to remain at the scene for the next two days putting out ""deep rooted hotspots"" which could reignite the blaze. More than 150 firefighters tackled the blaze overnight. Det Con Richard Evans said a joint police and fire service investigation was taking place into the cause of the blaze. ""I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and has any information as to how the fire started to contact us,"" he said. ""I would also urge anyone who was driving in the area of Bere Road and Sugar Hill between around 8am and 1pm on Monday 18 May 2020 to check their dashcam for anything relevant."" Nearby roads, including a section of the A35 at Bloxworth, were closed overnight and through Tuesday morning but have since reopened. A Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""We are still advising people to avoid the area and to find an alternative route where possible."" Seth Why, from the service, said: ""With the dry conditions there's a real danger that this fire could reignite."" He said 100 firefighters remained on site ""dealing with deep-rooted hotspots, burning roots and tree stumps"".

"The five-year project could see the renovation of historic buildings at Elvaston Castle plus a new adventure playground and camping facilities. The 321-acre estate, once home to the Earl of Harrington, has been owned by Derbyshire County Council since 1969 but has built up a backlog of repairs. Project leaders said they hoped to ""reverse decades of underinvestment and secure the estate's future"". The restoration project is a joint venture between Elvaston Castle and Garden Trust (ECGT) and Derbyshire County Council. Both organisations said they were committed to keeping the park, which has about 240,000 visitors a year, as a free attraction. 'Rising running costs' Transformation plans include renovating historic buildings and bringing them back to use, either as a work space or retail space. New catering facilities would be created along with an extra access road from near the A6, camping facilities, and the conversion of part of the house into a venue that could host weddings. A statement from the county council and ECGT said: ""During recent decades, shrinking local government budgets have meant that the council has struggled to meet rising running costs while a number of bids to provide the site with a sustainable future have unfortunately proved unsuccessful."" They said the restoration would be paid for by ""a mix of public and private investment"", including a bid for National Lottery funding. Derbyshire county councillor Tony King said: ""We believe this restoration will secure the future of Elvaston Castle and Country Park for generations to come by making it a sustainable visitor attraction that can stand on its own two feet, saving millions of pounds for Derbyshire council taxpayers who currently pay for the upkeep of the estate.""

"Princess Anne, who has lost 15 of her rare breed cattle to bovine TB in the past two years, was speaking to BBC One's Countryfile programme. Ministers say using gas is being looked at but two pilot culls aimed at cutting TB in cattle, which involved shooting badgers, are not being expanded. However, animal campaigners say culling will not stop bovine TB spreading and that gas is not a humane method to use. The interview with Princess Anne at her Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire was described by Countryfile as a ""frank and wide-ranging"" look at issues affecting the British countryside. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had originally planned to introduce up to 10 new cull areas in south-west England every year. But its own independent assessment showed that culls in two pilot areas had not been effective and raised questions about their humaneness. The pilot culls had involved contracted marksmen shooting the animals at night. Princess Anne, who has run Gatcombe Park for nearly 40 years, owns a herd of White Park cattle. In the past two years, 15 have been lost to TB, including two prize bulls. She said of gassing: ""Most of the people who did it in the past will tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it, if that's not a silly expression, because of the way it works. ""And how it works is that you go to sleep, basically."" 'Outspoken views' A senior member of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said ""farmers would welcome"" Princess Anne's comments. Andrew Guest, NFU county chairman for Gloucestershire, told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The Princess Royal is noted for outspoken views and her forthright honesty. ""I think it's an option that needs looking at. And provided we can tick all the boxes as far as humaneness goes then it would certainly be an option to consider."" Gassing badgers has been tried before. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Zoological Society for London said when gassing with cyanide was used in the 1970s it did not work, leading to the practice being banned in 1982. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If you go back to reports at the time, they are full of frustration about how it just wasn't very effective."" It was difficult to achieve lethal concentrations of gas due to the way badger setts are constructed and sub-lethal concentrations were ""inhumane"", Prof Woodroffe said. The RSPCA said it was ""strongly opposed"" to the use of gas to control the badger population. Its head of public affairs David Bowles said: ""Killing badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling. ""The government would have to undertake field trials of gassing before any decision is made and this is unlikely to occur. The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided badger cull policy."" And Badger Trust chief executive Dominic Dyer warned that because gas did not spread through setts evenly ""20 to 30% of the badgers will suffer prolonged painful deaths"" if it was used in a cull. He added: ""Many would have brain damage. Many of these animals will then move between sets. You disrupt colonies and if they're carrying TB you're then going to disperse the disease more widely."" Horse meat In a statement on Friday, Defra said: ""Initial investigations into the use of gas as a potential culling method are taking place as set out in the 25-year strategy to free England of bovine TB, which includes plans for more sophisticated TB testing, developing cattle and oral badger vaccines, tighter cattle movement controls, badger vaccination in the buffer zone and badger culling in areas where disease is widespread. ""It is not possible to say at this very early stage if or when gassing is likely to be a realistic or humane method of culling."" Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has proposed a programme of vaccination around the edges of the most badly affected parts of the country. This would create a buffer zone of immunity that would stop TB from spreading, he said. Discussing horses, Princess Anne said there were too many in Britain - thousands of which were neglected. ""An awful lot of the abandonments are because they don't perceive there to be any value in the animals,"" she told Countryfile's Tom Heap. ""So, 'okay - chuck them out, they'll survive or they'll die'. ""But the meat trade adds value to the animal, so there is some point in keeping it healthy if it's got an end point that it can go to."" Asked if she had eaten horse herself, the princess replied: ""Oh, certainly."" She added that it was ""very good, actually"". Countryfile is on BBC One on Sunday 6 April at 19:00 BST.","Gassing is the most humane way to cull badgers, the Princess Royal has said."
"Oxford City Council said Evenlode and Windrush towers in Blackbird Leys will have their rain-screen cladding replaced. It said no-one would have to be evacuated from the towers and Oxford's other three blocks do not use the material identified as being at risk. The move follows the fatal Grenfell Tower fire in London on 14 June. A spokesman for the council said the current cladding would be replaced with ""improved non-combustible material"" as a precautionary measure. The government has ordered all aluminium composite cladding on residential tower blocks be tested for fire safety. Evacuation 'not necessary' Council leader Bob Price said: ""Tenants' safety is our top concern and we will not compromise on safety standards. ""We have been working with Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service who have been involved in the design of the fire safety arrangements in the blocks. ""They completed a review of these arrangements and site inspections today, and confirmed that the fire safety measures in place are satisfactory. ""As a result I confirm that it is not necessary to evacuate the towers. ""We're arranging for the work to begin removing the cladding to start as soon as possible, and we'll let residents know more details about all of this as soon as we have finalised them."" The council said Oxford's other three tower blocks have rain-screen cladding made from non-combustible sheet aluminium, rather than aluminium composite. It added that leaseholders would not be charged for replacing the cladding.",Cladding will be removed from two high-rise blocks of flats in Oxford after it failed fire safety tests.
"Suren Gupta, from the insurance firm Allstate, revealed the figure at a major investment conference in Belfast. Delegates were addressed by a number of high-profile foreign investors who spoke about their experiences of doing business in Northern Ireland. Organisers of the two-day event hope it will help to attract new investors. Business executives from the US, France, China, Japan and Canada are attending the conference at Titanic Belfast. This is a flavour of what they have been hearing. Suren Gupta - Allstate, technology and operations executive vice president ""As a result of us being here over the last 15 years we have saved the company more than a billion dollars."" He said Northern Ireland was Allstate's second biggest base outside the US and had become its ""second home"". The company employs about 2,200 people across three sites in Northern Ireland, with many staff in software developing and testing roles. Mr Gupta said they had found the ""talent pool truly outstanding"" and said Northern Ireland was ""one of the best places to do business"". ""Every time we open our doors to work every day in Northern Ireland we save half a million dollars, and that is something that we don't take lightly,"" he told delegates. Pierre Beaudoin - Bombardier, president and chief executive officer ""I would strongly recommend Northern Ireland as a good place to do business and a good place in which to grow that business."" Mr Beaudoin told delegates Bombardier had 5,000 direct employees and an additional 1,000 support staff working at its aircraft manufacturing base in east Belfast. He told delegates that his company had bought the former Short Brothers facility in 1989, when Northern Ireland was experiencing ""much civil unrest"" and said was sure the move had ""raised eyebrows"" at the time. However, he said his firm recognised the location's potential and the ""strong work ethic"" of its people. Mr Beaudoin told the conference that Bombardier Belfast had ""grown to become one of the world's top aerospace design and manufacturing facilities"". ""Every time I visit Belfast I feel that we have made the right decision to acquire Shorts ."" Jay Roewe - HBO, senior vice president for West Coast Productions ""The success of HBO's Game of Thrones is in large part due to our presence and the collaboration with the people here in Northern Ireland ."" ""The reason I truly believe, and I think that we at HBO think it's successful, is because there's a special relationship with here with the people of Northern Ireland, and in many ways I truly believe I don't think we would have been as successful if we were shooting some place else, so this is a true partnership."" Libby Jackson - Herbert Smith Freehills, Belfast office director ""We were looking for the right location to set up an innovative, high quality, very cost competitive business to develop international legal services. ""We don't practice Northern Ireland law, we were bringing a new stream of legal work here, so the very high quality pool of qualified lawyers and legal assistants here coming out of the universities - an extremely well-educated group - was extremely important to us.""","International investors have been told that a US firm ""saved over a billion dollars"" due to its decision to locate in Northern Ireland 15 years ago."
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York ""At first it was kind of a boredom thing,"" the 31-year-old from Ohio says. ""It started to get into, 'Am I going to need this for money?' though thankfully I've kept my job."" Stormee used Poshmark, a resale platform which allows buyers and sellers to connect directly, taking a cut of each sale. It says sales this spring were up 50%. Rival UK-based Depop saw business double at the height of the lockdowns and says has growth has remained solid since. Stormee, who listed her first product for sale in May, has turned some of her Poshmark earnings over to her sister and boyfriend, in thanks for the cast-offs they contributed. She's also spent some $500 back on the site, tempted by purchases for herself. ""It's so hard not to,"" she says, adding that she's bought some Christmas presents there too. ""I like that I can prolong the use of clothes, instead of them just getting thrown away,"" she says. And, she adds, ""You can get really good prices."" The stay-at-home habits brought on by the pandemic have devastated demand for clothing and accessories stores, pushing sales down 25% or more and driving many firms towards collapse. But used fashion websites say they're seeing a different story. Fashionphile founder Sarah Davis was terrified about what the pandemic would do to her business. She had started the company, which specialises in online sales of used designer handbags, as a seller on eBay in 1997. Now it's a standalone site, handling $200m (£148m) worth of transactions in 2019 and growing some 50%. It turned out that that health or economic concerns didn't turn shoppers away. But the pandemic meant the sellers the site relies on were postponing trips to the post office. ""We were selling like crazy,"" she says. ""We were literally selling everything off the shelves and getting no product in."" Resale boom Ms Davis expects Fashionphile revenue to grow 20% this year, despite the supply hiccups. Fashions change Even before the pandemic, resale platforms were rising in popularity, as fashionistas embraced unique, any-decade looks, minimalism prompted wardrobe purges and concerns grew about the apparel industry's environmental impact. As the pandemic boosts online activity, while setting off an economic crisis, used fashion sites are poised to benefit, says Alexis DeSalva Kahler, senior analyst of retail and e-commerce at market research firm Mintel. Last year, Mintel surveys found roughly 66% of UK shoppers and more than 70% in the US had bought or were open to buying second-hand items. People worried about shopping second hand tended to cite concerns about cleanliness, Ms Kahler says. But interest in the practice actually increased during the pandemic. In June, about 20% of consumers surveyed in the US told Mintel that Covid had made them more interested in buying and selling second-hand clothing. Ms Kahler thinks wider concerns about catching the virus from surfaces like boxes and textiles have subsided since the initial panic this spring, as we learn more about how it is transmitted. She compares the interest in second hand clothes to the growth of fast fashion and flash discount sites like Gilt Groupe after the 2007-08 economic crash. ""We're a little bit wiser and more aware of the impact,"" she says. ""Consumers still want to save but there's a different way to do it."" Retail challenge In a June report for San Francisco's ThredUp, one of the leading resale sites, research firm GlobalData predicted the online market for used clothing and accessories could hit $36bn by 2024, up from $7bn in 2019, The potential growth has spooked traditional retailers, who have responded by investing in the upstarts, launching their own clothing recycling programmes and working with the challengers to sell used clothes in some of their stores. Selfridges in the UK, for example, hosted a pop-up shop with Depop last year. In the US, upmarket department store Neiman Marcus took a stake in Fashionphile, while ThredUp has worked with department sore chains JC Penney and Macy's to sell used goods in some stores. ""The retailers are going, 'Oh my god, it's a thing,'"" says Lee Peterson, executive vice president at Ohio-based retail consultancy WD Partners. ""They're of a mindset right now, 'Hey, let's fail fast. Let's try everything.'"" Some companies, including Nordstrom and JC Penney, have since ended their experiments. While they declined to discuss the experience, analysts said the decisions signal the firms' internal challenges during the pandemic, rather than waning interest in second-hand items. Indeed, in May Walmart revealed plans to collaborate on sales of used goods with ThredUp, while European e-commerce site Zalando launched a second-hand section of its site in September. ""Right now, for some retailers that are non-essential, they have to really shift their priorities,"" says Ms Kahler of Mintel. ""But there's a reason that everybody from specialty retailers to department stores is getting into the business. There's definitely demand. It's not something that's going away."" Investor doubts In recent months both Poshmark and ThredUp took their first steps towards a public share sale in the US. Sneaker resale site StockX has hinted at similar plans. The offerings are expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the companies and put their worth in the eyes of the market on a par with traditional retailers. But Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali says the listing flurry shouldn't be mistaken for proof that used clothes are the future of the fashion industry. ""The market is doing really well and people go public when the timing is right, when they think there's an appetite to raise money,"" she says. ""I don't think that it suggests there's some kind of amazing business in secondary stuff."" The RealReal, one of the few companies in the sector whose financial reports are open to the public, was valued at more than $2bn last year when its shares debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange. But shares in the luxury resale site have halved since their peak, while revenue at the firm has slipped about 5% this year, despite growth in other areas, like buyer numbers. Ms Kodali says technology has made it easier for buyers and sellers to connect, increasing the potential market of second-hand shops and making it easier to hunt down the perfect item. But the cost of listing and shipping one-of-a-kind - often inexpensive - items also makes for a challenging business model, she warns. ""[Thrift shops] have been around for ages. They're not going away but I wouldn't necessarily say they're on fire,"" she says. ""Technology enables you to direct that experience a little bit better but you can't be foolish about the costs.""","School cleaner Stormee James has made about $1,700 (£1,265) from selling used clothing this year, finding buyers for everything from bathing suits to her boyfriend's t-shirts."
"The parties agreed to back the formation of a minority Labour Welsh Government. They said it followed ""constructive and positive talks"" about ""shared priorities for the coming assembly, and future working arrangements"". The assembly will reconvene on Wednesday to elect a first minister. Both party groups met to discuss the proposals on Tuesday. ""We are pleased to confirm that the Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru groups have today contacted the Presiding Officer in order to recall the Assembly tomorrow, and proceed with the nomination procedure for First Minister,"" the parties said in a joint statement on Tuesday, entitled Moving Wales Forward. ""This will allow the successful nomination of Carwyn Jones as First Minister, and the establishment of a Labour Minority Administration. ""This follows constructive and positive talks about the parties' shared priorities for the coming Assembly, and future working arrangements. ""The First Minister will set out tomorrow the next Government's intentions for the first 100 days, including a commitment to prioritise those areas that enjoy support from across most of the Assembly."" No M4 deal Sources in Plaid and Labour say they have agreed a way for the two parties to exchange ideas and information. There was no agreement between them on the contentious issue of the M4 relief road, but the sources said the parties had ""agreed to progress what they could"". Senior figures from Labour and Plaid Cymru held two days of talks after a Senedd vote was tied 29-29 last Wednesday on whether Mr Jones or Plaid leader Leanne Wood should be first minister. UKIP and the Welsh Conservatives had backed Ms Wood, while Liberal Democrat AM Kirsty Williams supported Mr Jones. The tied vote came after Labour fell short of a majority at the 5 May election, leaving it in need of opposition support to govern. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies accused Plaid Cymru of ""locking themselves away and doing a cosy deal with their old friends in the Labour Party"". ""Plaid Cymru have shown a distinct lack of appetite and ambition in exploring a new kind of collaborative politics,"" he said. Leanne Wood, Plaid leader, said her party looks forward to offering ""robust opposition over the next five years"". ""The Conservatives failed to make a single gain, or to get a single manifesto commitment implemented during their time as the main opposition party in the last Assembly term. Perhaps that's why their seat share went down. Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams said: ""I welcome the progress that seems to have been made to securing a successful nomination for First Minister tomorrow. ""For my part, I shall engage constructively with others, seeking to do the best for Wales based on Welsh Liberal Democrats policies and priorities."" David Rowlands UKIP is intending to force a vote on the first minister nominations by putting one of their own ranks forward - although assembly sources say this can not be done under Senedd rules. But it has emerged that the party plans to nominate neither its UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill or UKIP Welsh Assembly group leader Neil Hamilton. David Rowlands, an AM for South Wales East, is instead the intended nominee. A source said: ""If they put up Neil Hamilton he would have had four votes. That's the reality. A spokesman for the UKIP group said: ""It was Neil Hamilton's idea to put Nathan Gill forward, but then Nathan Gill recommended David Rowlands. Neil accepted his recommendation. There was never any consideration that it might be Neil."" On whether the plan could go ahead, the spokesman said: ""The standing orders are not clear and they do not say there cannot be any more nominations. That will be up to the presiding officer however.""",Carwyn Jones is set to be re-elected first minister after Labour and Plaid Cymru AMs backed a deal to end the week-long deadlock over the post.

"Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms in England from Monday, according to the government. However, in Selby a local outbreak has seen infection rates rise to the fifth highest level in the country. Local director of public health Louise Wallace said students and staff should continue mask-wearing until half term. Selby currently has 69.5 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 9 May, with the England average being 23.3 per 100,000 people, according to the latest BBC data. Ms Wallace said the Covid infection rate in the town is ""slowly"" going down, but it is still the highest in North Yorkshire. She added: ""Our public health advice for secondary schools in Selby is to continue the use of face coverings for staff and students in classrooms and/or communal areas until May half term."" Selby High School principal Nick Hinchliffe said the government's change in guidance will not apply at his school, which has seen eight recent cases of coronavirus among students and staff. Ms Wallace said asymptomatic testing was under way and she was ""optimistic"" about the future, especially with the roll out of vaccines. Schools in Derbyshire could also see the continuation of face coverings because of an outbreak in Erewash, which now has the second highest case rate in the country with 181 cases per 100,000 people.

"The UK Independence Party has, as its name implies, one key policy - to leave the European Union. It is a simple, understandable message, which has led to the party gaining bigger shares of the votes in European elections. But it is also one which means people often dismiss it as a single issue party, unlikely to become a force in Westminster politics. It has spent considerable effort on broadening its appeal. And judging from recent opinion polls its wider policies - grammar schools, curbing immigration and opposing gay marriage - seem to have struck a chord with disenchanted voters from the ""big three"". In successive Westminster by-elections - and now in local elections - it seems to have become the party of choice for the anti-government and anti-politics vote. Defying predictions It has proved capable of causing upsets in Tory and Lib Dem heartlands in the South of England and, as the South Shields by-election demonstrated, Labour strongholds in the North. It has - to an extent - set out to emulate what the Lib Dems did in the 1980s and 1990s by building a network of local councillors as a springboard to success on the national stage. It has realised the hard way that it is not enough just to pitch up at a by-election with a loud hailer and some media-friendly stunts, it requires months, even years, of groundwork in the local area. The party's campaigning effort has become far more professional and well-funded in the past two years as a result. It is learning the highly specialised discipline, once the domain of the Lib Dems, of winning elections. The party has yet to make a breakthrough into Westminster politics - it does not have a single MP - but it came agonisingly close in the Eastleigh by-election last month, where it came within 2,000 votes of victory. And by establishing the beginnings of a power base in local government, something which had so far eluded it, it can concentrate on its aim of winning next year's European elections and its first representation at Westminster in the 2015 general election. But UKIP is no overnight success or, as it can sometimes seem from the ubiquity of leader Nigel Farage on the airwaves, a one-man party. It has had more twists and turns - and splits and schisms - in its 20 year history than a soap opera, with an equally colourful cast of characters. Small parties have a habit of disintegrating into internal warfare or being wiped out by the vagaries of the electoral system and political fashion - British politics has seen a few come and go over the years. UKIP has - so far - managed to keep its show on the road and defy the predictions of those who were ready to write the party off as, in the often quoted words of David Cameron, ""fruitcakes and loonies"". Modest beginnings The party was founded on 3 September 1993 at the London School of Economics by members of the Anti-Federalist League, which had been founded by Dr Alan Sked in November 1991 with the aim of running candidates opposed to the Maastricht Treaty in the 1992 general election. UKIP's early days were overshadowed by the much higher profile and well-financed Referendum Party, led by Sir James Goldsmith, which was wound up soon after the 1997 election. The new party's initial successes were all in the proportional representation elections for the European Parliament - winning its first three seats in 1999 with 7% of the vote. It built on that in 2004, winning 12 seats and pushing the Lib Dems into fourth place. The 2009 poll saw its total grow to 13 seats, pushing Labour into third place with 16% of the vote. General elections, however, with their first-past-the-post voting systems, have been a very different story and the party has failed to make the breakthrough it has been hoping for. In 2001 it saved its deposit (that is, got at least 5% of votes) in just one seat. In 2005 it saved its deposit in 38 seats but lost its deposits in 451 others - costing about £225,500. Even its then leader, former Tory MP Roger Knapman, could only poll 7% of the votes in Totnes, Devon.] Kilroy was here In 2010 it was led into the general election by Lord Pearson of Rannoch but again lost out, with just 3% of the vote across the UK, although there were signs of progress as it saved its deposit in 100 seats. The party had hoped to make headlines after Nigel Farage stood down as leader so he could take on Speaker John Bercow in Buckingham at the 2010 election - he did make the headlines but it turned out they were about a plane crash that almost cost Farage his life, rather than election success. Farage recovered from his injuries and returned to head the party later in the year, in the latest instalment of the colourful story of UKIP's leadership. Original leader and UKIP founder Alan Sked quit before the 1999 European elections, after arguing the party should refuse seats in the ""gravy train"" of the Strasbourg Parliament. Shortly after that, the national executive lost a no confidence vote and leader Michael Holmes resigned, although he remained an MEP. Mr Knapman took over the role of leader in 2002, but in 2004, a new pretender to the crown - former Labour MP and chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk - arrived in a flurry of publicity to shake things up once again. Before long he was openly jockeying for the leadership and was the media face of the party for its 2004 European election success - but when Mr Knapman refused to stand aside for him, Mr Kilroy-Silk quit and formed his own short-lived rival party. Some thought that without ex-TV host Kilroy's recognition factor the party might struggle. Farage returns In 2006, the lower-key Knapman retired, to be replaced by Nigel Farage, a confident media performer, who pledged to make UKIP a ""truly representative party"", ending its image as a single-issue pressure group. He spearheaded its success at the 2009 European elections and raised UKIP's profile, but then surprised his own party conference in September 2009 by standing down as leader. Mr Farage said he would instead run for a seat in the Commons - specifically the seat of Commons Speaker John Bercow, which, by convention, other major parties do not fight. Mr Farage said it was ""very important that UKIP gets a voice in Westminster"". It did not achieve this in 2010 but the party has seen its poll ratings rise since the general election, overtaking the Lib Dems on a number of occasions, and putting in strong showings in recent by-elections. David Cameron's historic pledge to hold and an in/out referendum on UK membership of the EU if the Conservatives won the next election was interpreted by some as an attempt to halt the rise of UKIP, which senior Tories feared could prevent them from winning an overall majority in 2015. 'Engaging geezer' If that was Mr Cameron's plan, it does not appear to have worked. Mr Farage criticised the decision to delay the vote by five years, he claimed the prime minister's promise showed ""we have changed the political agenda in this country"" calling it ""our proudest achievement to date"". Asked what he would do if the British people voted to remain in the EU, Mr Farage joked that he would have to get a ""proper job"". But the party's success in local elections suggests it might have a future even without the European issue, as a libertarian, right wing alternative to a centrist Conservative Party. UKIP appears to have struck a chord with many voters on the issue of immigration, campaigning against the relaxation of working restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians due to come into force in January. It has rejected claims by cabinet minister Ken Clarke and others that it is simply ""against"" foreigners, arguing that it is in favour of a sensible ""managed"" migration policy, something Mr Farage argues is not possible while Britain remains in the EU. UKIP took a calculated decision to ramp up its efforts in this year's local elections, an arena in which it has previously struggled to make an impression. Rapidly increasing its number of candidates to more than 1,700 - three times the number that stood in the same contest in 2009 - did not come without problems. Farage admitted the party had not had time to properly vet all of its new recruits and he was forced to suspend a handful of them following newspaper reports of alleged racist comments. It has been a key part of his strategy to distance the party from the far right - its constitution bans former BNP members from joining. But the gamble appears to have paid-off with gains being made across the Conservative-dominated councils up for election. Mr Farage's maverick style - his fondness for a pint of beer, disarming frankness and ability to laugh at himself - has given him a similar kind of appeal to voters as Boris Johnson, who has described the UKIP man as ""a rather engaging geezer"". He claims to have no ambition for high office - and with the party still lacking representation at Westminster that is not going to happen soon - but it has, against all the odds, established itself as a genuine force. The question now, for Farage's nervous rivals in the big three parties, is what next?","Winning council seats across England, challenging for victory in Westminster by-elections, overtaking the Lib Dems in the polls - how did UKIP go from the fringes to a force in British politics?"
"The plan should be launched in the autumn of next year. Under it, authorised companies will pay for the insulation work and homeowners will repay the money, plus interest, through additional charges on their energy bills. The government hopes people will repay loans of up to £10,000, over 25 years. Climate change minister Greg Barker said: ""The Green Deal is the government's flagship energy saving plan to transform the country's homes to make them warmer and cheaper to run. ""From next year, people will be able to access up to £10,000 upfront to pay for energy efficiency work, repaying the costs through savings on energy bills."" Legal changes The scheme still requires a lot of work before it is ready to start. A few firms such as Marks & Spencer, B&Q, Tesco and British Gas have expressed an interest in marketing the scheme and providing the finance. But the law will need to be changed so that energy firms will be obliged to collect the repayments from homeowners via their energy bills. The law will also need to be altered so that anyone who buys after the work has been done, but before the bill has been fully paid, is obliged to take on the debt and repay it. These legal changes are included in the current Energy Bill, which is going through parliament and should receive its Royal Assent this July. It has also not yet been decided just how much interest will be added to the loans. How will it work? The firms who eventually market the Green Deal will employ assessors to estimate just how much a householder can save through various insulation or heating measures. These may include loft insulation, condensing boilers, draught proofing, solar panels and double glazing. Once the work is assessed and agreed, the installation work will be contracted out to accredited installers. Then the homeowners will have to start paying. A key feature is that homeowners must be able to save more on their energy bills than they pay back. What is the attraction for the big firms that the government hopes will market the scheme? ""Companies will see it as a marketing opportunity to sell other things,"" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Anne Robinson, of the price comparison website Uswitch, said: ""People who have the Green Deal will be paying a lot less for their energy after a year or two."" But Richard Lloyd, of the consumers' association Which?, warned against the dangers of shoddy workmanship. ""Our latest research into cavity wall insulation uncovered inadequate inspections and poor advice,"" he said. ""For this scheme to be a success, Green Deal assessors need to be held to the highest standards.""",The government has revealed more details of its Green Deal scheme to help people pay for home insulation and other energy saving measures.

"The statue was offered to South Kesteven District Council after plans to erect it in London were rejected. The Conservative-led authority agreed to fund the launch event in Grantham and said it ""fully expected"" the money to be recouped in donations. An independent councillor has asked a committee to scrutinise that decision. Ashley Baxter has requested the call-in of the scrutiny committee, which could reverse the decision by the Conservative leadership, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. He said: ""The decision has been taken entirely by local members of the Conservative party without even a proper opportunity for discussion, let alone a vote. ""There is no clear outline business plan explaining how third-party funding will be acquired, let alone why the council has somehow taken on responsibility for the fundraising."" At the start of December, council leaders agreed to set aside the £100,000 to unveil the statue in Grantham town centre. The authority hoped to raise the money for the event, and then fill any gaps. Council leader Kelham Cooke previously said the launch event ""provides a fantastic opportunity for the Grantham community to celebrate its heritage and to promote the district"". The bronze statue was acquired for £300,000, mainly through public fundraising, private donations and supporters of Grantham Museum, and is currently stored at ""a secret location"". The council agreed to put it on a 10ft (3m) high plinth to prevent vandalism, making the entire structure more than 20ft (6m) overall.

"The pull cord alarm used in emergencies by elderly, disabled or vulnerable residents, will end in September. The Conservative-run council said it was part of plans to reduce its Supporting People budget by £7.6m by 31 March 2016. Opposition councillors and unions said ending the alarm system could increase costs in the long term. The council said the full-year cost for the alarms was £529,200. About 50 contracts offering the service will end on 30 September. The service covers residents in sheltered housing in Basingstoke and Deane, East Hampshire, Havant, Eastleigh, Fareham, Gosport, Hart, Rushmoor, Test Valley, Winchester and the New Forest. Cllr Liz Fairhurst said: ""We know how much people value these services and it's always difficult to make changes to provision, but we are facing significant budget pressures which mean we can no longer sustain the current level of funding."" The council said people currently using the alarm service would be assessed for social care support or offered a self-funded option. 'Most vulnerable' Liberal Democrat councillor David Harrison said: ""If someone falls over and they are on the floor for four or five hours for want of an alarm, that's likely to be a bigger burden on the NHS and the county council and a lot of human misery which could be avoided."" Trade unions said the cuts were ""unnecessary"". Tim Cutter of Unison said: ""There is £419m in council reserves - those reserves should be used to help the most vulnerable."" Residents of the Alma House in Aldershot, one of the homes using the alarm system, previously said losing it would have a ""big effect"". Other changes include the development of a new community-based support service and help for people to access services provided by the voluntary and community sector. The council said it had to make £43m in savings overall in adult services by the end of 2015/16.","A sheltered housing alarm service will be switched off under budget cuts, Hampshire County Council has confirmed."
"On Saturday the Home Office asked defence chiefs for help to make crossings in small boats ""unviable"". The Home Office says 18 Syrian migrants in a boat were picked up by Border Force on Monday morning. More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the Channel from France in small boats so far this year. Pierre-Henri Dumont, the National Assembly member for Calais, told the BBC: ""What is the British navy going to do if it sees a small boat? Is it going to shoot the boat? Is it going to enter French waters? ""It's a political measure to show some kind of muscle but technically speaking it won't change anything."" In response to Mr Dumont's comments, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) source said: ""To imply that the UK navy would operate outside of UK and international laws and norms is dangerous and misleading. ""The military will support the Home Office in their work to combat Channel crossings."" Mr Dumont said the French authorities needed to monitor about 300 miles of coastline if they were to stop migrants launching small boats from French shores. ""We are already trying to do whatever we can. We can't have a camera and police officer every 10 metres."" The MoD says it has sent an RAF Atlas aircraft with spotters on board to help Border Force operations in the Channel. Home Secretary Priti Patel was in Dover on Monday and was seen disembarking from a police boat that had been in the English Channel earlier in the morning. A spokesman for the Home Office said she joined Kent Police to see first-hand Border Force operations at sea and witness CPV Hunter and HMC Protector on patrol in the Dover Straits. She also met with Chief Constable of Kent Police, Alan Pughsley. Ms Patel said: ""The number of illegal small boat crossings we have seen recently is totally unacceptable. ""Our operational partners are dealing with complex challenges associated with them and collectively with the French we need make this route unviable. ""Across Government we are absolutely committed to shutting down this route and we will bring down the criminal gangs that facilitate these illegal crossings."" Analysis: Helen Catt, BBC News Since the demolition of the infamous ""Jungle"" nearly four years ago, French authorities have been successful in stopping other large scale camps from forming. But migrants do still arrive in Calais, they are just more scattered. Greater security measures - including a wall built along the motorway with UK funding - have made it more difficult for migrants to stow away on lorries. In response, people smugglers have increasingly turned to the equally risky method of crossing in small boats. The French and UK governments have worked closely on this for something approaching two decades; the Treaty of Le Touquet which effectively moved the UK border to Calais (and the French border to Dover) to allow checks to happen before crossings, was signed in 2003. But they can't change geography. Calais remains a magnet because it is only 20 miles from the UK - on a clear day in Dover, you can see the headlights of French traffic on the other side of the sea. No amount of planes, walls or navy deployments can alter that. Quite apart from the humanitarian issue, there is added political pressure for the UK government. David Cameron was pretty roundly criticised for suggesting in 2016 that Brexit would mean the French would pull out of bilateral agreements and ""Jungle-style"" camps would appear on the south coast of England. There's certainly no indication of that but there's no doubt that the images of dinghies landing on Kent's beaches will be a difficult one for a government that has set huge store by its promise to ""take back control"" of immigration. More than 700 people were intercepted crossing the English Channel last week, including 235 - the record for a single day - on Thursday. Immigration minister Chris Philp is due to go to Paris this week to demand stronger measures from French authorities. He said he wanted to make the route ""completely unviable"" so migrants ""will have no incentive to come to northern France or attempt the crossing in the first place"". Mr Philp added he also wanted to ""return as many migrants who have arrived as possible"", adding there were ""returns flights planned in the coming days"". Sir David Normington, former permanent secretary at the Home Office, told the BBC the ""only solution"" was to work with French officials to ""persuade them to intensify their efforts"" to stop the migrants leaving France. ""If it takes money to help the French increase their resources and their manpower then that will have to be done,"" he said. Sir David said he was ""sceptical"" about the deployment of the Royal Navy. ""If the navy is going to push boats back, it will have to go into French water to do that, and then you can only do that with the permission of the French government."" The prime minister said he wanted to work with the French to stop the activity of ""cruel"" criminal gangs taking migrants across the English Channel. ""We need to look at the means by which they are coming here, we need to stop them, working with the French, we need to stop them from getting across the Channel,"" Boris Johnson said. ""But number two we need to look at the legal framework that we have, all the panoply of laws that an illegal immigrant has at his or her disposal that allow them to stay here and we need to look at what we can do to change that.""

"Up to 10 adults will now be able to attend sessions if their babies are under a year. However, the five-parent limit remains in place where the children are over 12 months old. The change has been welcomed but business owners say they want the rules to be relaxed even further. Some parents and businesses had previously warned of the impact of the restrictions and called for them to be eased. 'Very little return' Louisa Fairley, who runs Moo Music activity classes in the Highlands, said the change did not go far enough. ""The fact we can now have 10 adults in our baby class is better, but not good enough when we usually run at double that,"" she said. ""It does mean we might be able to run a few baby classes, although with very little return. ""The fact that it's limited to under 12 months is baffling."" Louise Fraser, from Physi-ball Inverness, said she could not resume her activities because the youngest children she caters for have to be 18 months old. She said: ""If I was allowed to have 10 adults that would be absolutely ideal because the smallest halls I hire are for groups of 10 anyway."" Jennifer Neil is regional franchisee of children's activities business Wow World Group, covering an area in and around Glasgow. She said: ""The news is fantastic for our baby sensory classes, changing them from unviable to manageable. ""We should be able to get lots of isolated babies into a class where both they and their mums can start socialising with others. ""As a business we will not make a great deal by the time costs are covered, but we will not need to make any of our baby sensory staff redundant."" 'Strike a balance' She added that the rules remained ""inconsistent"" and that she would love to see the restriction relaxed for those over 12 months old. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing on Monday that clinical advice had been sought before revising the rules. She said the government had considered the concerns that limits on numbers could have a ""disproportionate"" affect on the wellbeing of new mothers and their babies. ""What we hope is that this change, while I am sure not satisfying everybody, will strike a balance between supporting the wellbeing of new parents and in particular perinatal mental health, while also making sure we are taking appropriate steps to stop the virus spreading,"" she said.",Moves to relax Covid-19 restrictions for parent and baby groups in Scotland have received a mixed reaction from childcare businesses.
"People referred for assessment by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) should be seen within 28 days. NSPCC Cymru said it was a worrying picture. The Welsh Government said there had been a 44% decrease in people having to wait for six months, compared to 2015. Des Mannion, the head of service for NSPCC Cymru, said that, while some improvements had been made, it was clear there were still problems. ""These figures lay bare the true scale of delays in accessing mental health services for children and it's a worrying picture,"" he said. ""It does seem pretty shocking that we're having some young people waiting for more than six months for their first appointment. That can't be good. ""Investment in these sort of services for children and young people is actually money that's well spent both in terms of outcomes for them but also in terms of preventing them needing further intervention support in their adult lives."" Another charity has also expressed concern about the delays. Changing Minds is a project run by Newport Mind for 14-25 year olds in Newport. It works on early intervention strategies for these young people but said the delays had increased pressure on services. Project manager Jules Twells said: ""I think because CAMHS is struggling with the resources it has, what tends to happen is that when people are on their waiting list, they need additional support so we're getting the referrals that CAMHS and primary mental health care should be dealing with. ""It's putting a strain on our referral mechanisms because we can't support the early intervention because we're dealing with the treatment of mental health issues."" Abi Larcombe, 17, has suffered with mental health issues since she was about 11. She only received support from mental health services after she tried to take her own life. ""I knew I needed help but I was refusing to acknowledge that there was an issue. I didn't want to accept the fact I was ill,"" she said. 'Backlog' Aneurin Bevan health board said: ""We have had a backlog of cases due to us having experienced a shortfall of clinical staff available to undertake first assessments. ""However, since 2015-16 we have addressed this issue with the provision of additional clinical sessions and a successful recruitment programme which occurred as a result of additional investment by the Welsh Government."" Betsi Cadwaladr health board said its team had seen an increase in demand but it expected to meet its target of seeing 80% of first referrals within 28 days by the end of January. Powys Teaching health board said that no-one had waited for more than six months since October 2015. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Statistics show that in the 12 months to October 2016 there has been an increase of 16% in the number of referrals to CAMHS, compared with the previous 12-month period. ""Comparing the data from October 2015 with October 2016, there has been a 31% decrease in those waiting over four weeks and a 44% decrease in those waiting over 26 weeks.""","More than 1,000 young people out of 18,000 referred to mental health services this year waited more than six months for a first appointment, a children's charity has said."

"Anne Marie Waters, who founded the Sharia Watch pressure group and has called Islam ""evil"", has been allowed to stand in UKIP's leadership election. Mike Hookem said he was not prepared to ""turn a blind eye"" to extremism. He resigned after UKIP chief whip Stuart Agnew declared his support for Ms Waters. In a letter to interim UKIP leader Steve Crowther - sent before Ms Waters was passed by the party's national executive as a leadership candidate - Mr Hookem said he was ""disturbed"" by Mr Agnew's support. In a later statement, he elaborated: ""I strongly disagree with the views Ms Waters and Mr Agnew promote and I would like to put as much distance between me and them as possible."" He said he was not a racist and would not support someone ""who seeks to single out a section of our society simply due to their religious beliefs"". 'Doesn't make sense' Mr Hookem subsequently told the BBC News Channel: ""I believe she should not be in the party and she should not be standing as a candidate. ""She could not stand for a Westminster seat because she was not a member of good standing. ""She could not stand as a Police and Crime Commissioner as she was not a member of good standing - and now suddenly she's standing for the top job."" Mr Hookem continued: ""It doesn't make sense. God forbid she does become leader."" He said he would not quit the party if Ms Waters was elected, but he would not support her. Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on the burka, the closure of all Sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will strike a chord with many voters. But fellow MEP Nathan Gill has said he would leave the party if she became leader. ""She shouldn't be a member of this party, but we are where we are,"" he said. ""If she was elected, I would have to leave."" Former leader Nigel Farage has warned that UKIP will be ""finished"" if it becomes an anti-Islam party. But the party's deputy leader, Peter Whittle, said it was right that Ms Waters be allowed to stand. Mr Whittle - who is also competing to be leader - said she had passed the vetting process. ""If you get through that then you should be allowed to stand,"" he said. Mr Whittle told the Today programme he was concerned by the number of Sharia courts in the UK. ""There is one law in this country and that is British law,"" he said, denying it was an anti-Islamic viewpoint. He added that he was for a ""cohesive multi-ethnic society ... united under British values and British laws"", adding that multiculturalism had led to ""a more fragmented society"". Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay, held on 29 and 30 September. Mr Whittle and Ms Waters are among 11 candidates vying to be leader after Paul Nuttall - who has previously said Ms Waters' views made him ""uncomfortable"" - stood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election.

"By Paul HarrisonBBC UGC and Social News The tweet, which suggested the sitting president should be ""shot into the sun"" from a cannon should the ""Dow Joans"" drop significantly, was posted minutes after US stocks suffered their worst fall for more than six years on Monday. Since he took office in January 2017, President Trump has tweeted a number of times about the increasing value of US stock markets, highlighting the gains as evidence of economic improvement under his presidency. However, social media users often look through Trump's previous tweets to find statements and claims he made in the past which contradict his current stance. There is even a Reddit index called r/TrumpCriticizesTrump where users flag up old Trump tweets and post inconsistencies. So when British author Shaun Usher posted a screenshot of what looked like a tweet from the president on Monday, using Trump's characteristic style and dated from February 2015, it did not take long to generate interest. Almost 20,000 people retweeted Usher and 41,000 have liked his tweet in 14 hours. It, and his string of tweets in response have generated tens of thousands of comments. Fifteen minutes after his initial post, Usher expressed his surprise that many people thought the tweet was ""genuine"". Ten minutes after that, he realised his tweet had gone ""everywhere"" and later described the situation as ""wild"". Usher said the Washington Post and fact-checking site Snopes have been in touch with him to discuss the tweet. You might like this: Many people are criticising Usher for sharing his fake tweet, but he said the tweet went beyond his control and deleting it ""felt wrong"". While others are saying the tweet is ""fake,"" and that Usher has added to the confusion around ""fake news"". However, some appreciated the point they believe Usher's tweet was trying to prove.

"By Nick ServiniPolitical editor, Wales Accountants Deloitte said a consultant was given the specifications for a tender two days before his competitors. It also recommended rule changes to its declarations of interest after considering a research firm contract. Sport Wales - whose chairman and vice-chairwoman remain suspended amid concerns its board was dysfunctional - accepted the report. But the body, which promotes and distributes money for elite and grassroots sport, said Deloitte found no impropriety. Sam Whale, managing director of a firm called Unforgiving Minute, won a £33,600 contract in April 2016 to mentor Sport Wales staff. The Deloitte report said he was given the tender specification by Sport Wales chief Sarah Powell on 4 April, two days before other bidders. Emailing Sport Wales staff members on 4 April, Ms Powell said she was in the process of confirming Mr Whale's contract. The email is one of a series seen by BBC Wales, including correspondence between the two discussing the terms of the contract, including work locations, timelines and prices, nearly a month before it went out to tender. It culminates in an email, two days before the rest of the tender emails were sent, from Ms Powell to Mr Whale which said: ""I'm still not 100% sure how we are going to finalise this tender but if you could provide us with a submission based on this I can at least get this moving in our system here. ""I was thinking if we did this I can send to a couple of people and apologise for the short notice but this is where we are and see who comes back?"" Unforgiving Minute was the only tender as the other companies were unable to respond within the required time frame. Deloitte's report, leaked to BBC Wales, said: ""There is a risk that there may be a perception of some bidders being given undue advantage during the tender process which may be perceived as undermining the spirit of transparency for public procurement."" There was no response from Mr Whale when contacted by BBC Wales. There was also no suggestion of impropriety by him in the report. Deloitte also looked at four contracts, worth a total of £71,000, awarded to Beaufort Research since 2011. The accountants said three out of four relevant tender evaluation forms could not be located, meaning Deloitte was unable to determine who was involved in assessing the tenders. 'Transparency and fairness' Deloitte described the lack of documentation as an oversight but said there was evidence elsewhere that proper procedures were being followed. The managing director of Beaufort Research is Fiona McAllister, sister of the then chairwoman of Sport Wales, Laura McAllister. Deloitte said there was no evidence the chairwoman was involved in the decision-making process but that, while earlier declarations of interest were made by Laura McAllister, she had not done so since 2013. However, Sport Wales staff are only asked to declare interests of immediate family members, which does not include siblings, and Deloitte said Sport Wales may want to consider using a broader definition. Beaufort Research also failed to make any explicit declaration of interest, even though the tender document asked it to make known any relevant conflicts of interest. The report said: ""There is a risk that the principle of transparency and fairness may be perceived to be undermined, resulting in reputational damage to Sport Wales if perceived conflicts of interest are not declared."" Laura McAllister said: ""As confirmed by the internal auditors, all declarations of interest were made by me as chair in accordance with guidelines, in full at all times. ""Clearly, there would be no involvement from a board chair in contract awards of any kind."" Fiona McAllister said Beaufort Research ""submitted a large number of tenders to Sport Wales, winning some contracts and losing others, but always via a competitive and rigorous procurement process"". ""I was not involved in the bid team for the four contracts awarded since 2011 or in carrying out any of the research for these contracts,"" she added. ""Beaufort has always dealt with the Sport Wales research and evaluation team on tenders and projects, never with the chair or any of the board members. ""Therefore we did not believe there was a need to declare a conflict of interest."" A Sport Wales spokesman said: ""This report made a number of recommendations relating to the procurement of external consultants across the organisation and identified a number of areas where procedures could be improved. ""As a result of these recommendations a set of management responses were provided to and accepted by Deloitte. ""Those responses were endorsed by the Sport Wales audit and risk committee at their meeting on 10 March 2017. ""At no point in this report do Deloitte suggest any impropriety on the part of staff within Sport Wales."" Welsh Conservative spokesman on sport, Russell George, said Sport Wales reputation was being ""harmed by each revelation"", saying ministers had to ""consider its future very carefully"".","Sport Wales risked damaging its reputation in the way it awarded contracts, an internal audit has found."

""Last week, alone, five young people that I know of have come through my office. ""On Friday afternoon I pleaded with a young man on the telephone not to go and get shot. ""His view was that it might be easier to take a flesh wound than to go through all of this."" On Saturday more than 200 people attended a rally in Guildhall Square in Derry to protest against RAAD. RAAD has been linked to a number of shootings in the city in recent months, and it claimed responsibility for the murder of Andrew Allen in February. On Thursday, RAAD was blamed for shooting a man in both legs in Creggan. The organisers of the protest claimed the attack was deliberately timed to coincide with the rally. The latest punishment-style shooting took place in Rinmore Drive at about 22:00 BST on Thursday. The mother of the 18-year-old victim described how she had been ordered to bring him to an alleyway close to Creggan shops.

The woman, who did not want to be named, said her son had been targeted because of his involvement in drugs. Saturday's rally was organised by an anti-vigilante group known as RAAD - Not In Our Name. It insisted that the latest shooting would not deter the protestors, but could result in encouraging more people to come out onto the streets.","Five men have fled Londonderry in the past week after being threatened by the vigilante group, Republican Action Against Drugs."

"Renovation work is now taking place on Church Cottage in Tutshill, close to the banks of the River Severn. The author lived there between the ages of nine and 18 and in 2011 bought the cottage through a property company in her married name. She paid about £400,000 for the house, which is said to have inspired key elements of the young wizard's story. Land Registry records show in September 2011, Edinburgh-based Caernarfon Lettings Ltd, which lists the author's husband Neil Murray as a director, bought Church Cottage. The property was sold by BBC producer Julian Mercer, who himself had bought it off the Rowling family in 1995. At the time of the 2011 sale, the cottage was said to have elements of the Harry Potter story within its walls, including a cupboard under the stairs similar to the one where the Dursley family made Harry live. The author also left her mark on Church Cottage with ""Joanne Rowling slept here circa 1982"" scrawled on one wall.

"The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB), known as ""the mother of all bombs"", is the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in a conflict. The Pentagon said it was dropped from a US aircraft in Nangarhar province. The news came hours after the Pentagon admitted an air strike in Syria mistakenly killed 18 rebels. It said a partnered force had mistakenly identified the target location as an IS position, but the strike on 11 April had killed rebels from the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is backed by Washington. How powerful is 'mother of all bombs'? 'Many militants killed' The strike in Afghanistan follows last week's death of a US special forces soldier fighting IS in Nangarhar. The GBU-43/B bomb was dropped in Achin district on Thursday evening local time, the Pentagon said. It is more than 9m (30 feet) in length. It was first tested in 2003, but had not been deployed in combat before. ""We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely, making it easier for them to target US military advisers and Afghan forces in the area,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, using another name for IS. He said necessary precautions were taken to prevent civilian casualties and ""collateral damage"". Achin district governor Esmail Shinwari told the BBC there were no civilian casualties because no civilians lived in the area. Earlier Mr Shinwari told the AFP news agency that the explosion was the biggest he had ever seen and that huge flames ""engulfed the area"". The US has not yet confirmed the results of the strike in detail, but a local official told the BBC that many IS militants were killed, allegedly including the brother of a senior leader. US President Donald Trump called it ""another successful job"". 'A huge weapon' - Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent The clue is in the ungainly name - the MOAB or GBU-43/B massive ordnance air blast is the US military's most destructive conventional (that is non-nuclear) bomb. It is a huge weapon and is GPS-guided. It was dropped from a MC-130 aircraft - the US Special Forces variant of the Hercules transport. The weapon is carried on a special cradle inside the aircraft from which it is extracted by a parachute. Its principal effect is a massive blast over a huge area. It is a larger version of weapons used during the Vietnam War. The Trump administration's policy towards Afghanistan remains under consideration but the use of this weapon sends a powerful signal that IS is top of the administration's target list wherever its offshoots may be found. Gen John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, said the jihadist group's ""losses have mounted, they are using IEDs, bunkers and tunnels to thicken their defence. ""This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive."" Mr Shinwari said clearance operations by Afghan special forces with US air support had begun in the area nearly two weeks ago. Many IS militants had been killed or injured, he added. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency. IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? However, experts say it has struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan. It has also steadily lost territory and fighters to US air strikes and an assault by Afghan forces on the ground Estimates about IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from several hundred to a few thousand fighters. US forces say their number has been cut in half since early 2016 due to military operations.","The US military says it has dropped a 21,600lb (9,800kg) bomb on a tunnel complex used by Islamic State militants in Afghanistan."
"The Fianna Fáil motion against Frances Fitzgerald comes over her handling of a police whistleblower controversy. Her party, Fine Gael, passed a motion to support her at an emergency party meeting on Thursday night. Fianna Fáil front bench members lodged the motion for debate next Tuesday. Fine Gael lead the minority government with the support of Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil, the main opposition party, agreed to back a Fine Gael minority government after the 2016 general election did not return a majority government. Under the terms of the confidence and supply arrangement, Fianna Fáil agreed not to vote against the minority government in confidence motions and to support it for three budgets, two of which are now past. Now, the government looks likely to collapse, forcing a snap election next month, unless Ms Fitzgerald resigns before the no confidence motion is debated. Sinn Féin, the country's third largest party, had tabled their own no confidence motion on Thursday. It is due to be debated and voted on next week. Ms Fitzgerald has been under pressure over her handling of an ongoing controversy around a Garda (police) whistleblower when she was Irish justice minister. Analysis: Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Dublin correspondent What we are witnessing is a game of call my bluff, involving three political parties. The decision by Sinn Féin to put down a motion of no confidence in Frances Fitzgerald was aimed at calling Fianna Fáil's bluff. That's because Fianna Fáil has an agreement with the minority-led Fine Gael government whereby they were prepared to support them in a confidence-and-supply arrangement. But Fianna Fáil called Sinn Féin's bluff by deciding to put down their motion of no confidence which will take precedence over the Sinn Féin one - at a time when Sinn Féin is undergoing generational change. Fine Gael is now calling Fianna Fáil's bluff by saying they are prepared to go to the country over this issue. Once TDs go back into their constituencies they will face questions from the public: How can you bring down a government over a missing or forgotten email by Frances Fitzgerald during key Brexit talks, when many thousands of people are homeless and there are huge hospital waiting lists? Fine Gael normally prides itself on putting the country before the party. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the coming days, Frances Fitzgerald fell on her sword. Ms Fitzgerald has faced questions in the Dáil (Irish parliament) about what she knew about what lawyers were going to put to a whistleblower at a commission of enquiry. In particular, she has been questioned over her account of an email she received about the legal strategy of the former Garda commissioner in the case of Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald has recently admitted that she was made aware a year earlier than she had previously stated, that lawyers for the Garda were going to attempt to discredit Sgt McCabe. The email was initially sent to Ms Fitzgerald in May 2015, but she told the Dáil earlier this week that she could not remember reading it. Speaking to Irish national broadcaster RTÉ, Fianna Fáil justice spokesperson Jim O'Callaghan said that Ms Fitzgerald ""should go"". He said that party leader Micheál Martin had expressed this view to Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTÉ that the government would continue to support Ms Fitzgerald and that calls for her resignation were ""built on sand"".",The Republic of Ireland could face a general election after the country's second largest party tabled a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister.
"Pranab Mukherjee's remarks came after a meeting with Ms Lagarde. Ms Lagarde was in Delhi on Tuesday on the latest leg of a world tour aimed at drumming up support for her bid. Emerging economies have voiced their concerns over the continuing hold of European nations over the IMF. Former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned amid US sex assault charges. Ms Lagarde met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee during her day long visit to India. ""There is no assurance [on supporting Christine Lagarde]. We are working on a consensus,"" Mr Mukherjee was quoted as saying by the state-run Doordarshan News after his meeting with Ms Lagarde. Mr Mukherjee said India ""wants election of managing director of IMF to be on the basis of merit and competence and to be held in a transparent manner and not on any particular nationality"". Ms Lagarde, however, said she had ""excellent"" meetings with the Indian leaders. ""We had excellent meetings and we were able to review quite a few issues concerning the current status of the Indian economy as well as my own perspective to the candidacy for the post of managing director of the IMF"", she told reporters. Ms Lagarde started her tour in Brazil on Monday, and is expected to visit China. The balance of global financial power has changed drastically in the past few years. Economies like China and India have grown at a much faster pace that those in the developed world, making them increasingly important players on the world stage. However, their influence in global bodies like the IMF has not altered greatly during the same period.","India's finance minister has said there is ""no assurance"" the country will support French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde's bid to head the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"By Helier CheungBBC News, Bergen In November 1970, the badly burnt body of a woman was found in a remote spot in Norway's Isdalen valley. Someone had cut the labels off her clothes, and scraped distinctive marks off her belongings - as if to stop her from being identified. And as police started investigating her death, they uncovered a trail of coded messages, disguises, and fake identities - but never cracked the case. Forty-six years later, Norwegian police and NRK journalists have decided to reopen the investigation. This is the story of the Isdal Woman - and the perplexing trail of clues she left behind. WARNING: This article contains one graphic image Clue one: The body in 'Death Valley' On the morning of 29 November 1970, a man and his two young daughters see a body in Isdalen Valley. The corpse is sprawled across some rocks - with its arms extended in a ""boxer"" position, typical of bodies that have been burnt. Isdalen is known to some locals as ""Death Valley"" - it was a site where people committed suicide in medieval times, and, in the 1960s, some hikers had fallen to their deaths while trekking in the fog. But the woman does not appear to be a normal hiker. ""It was out of the way - it was an unusual place to walk,"" Carl Halvor Aas, a police lawyer who was one of the first officers to be called to the scene, recounts to the BBC. He remembers ""a strong smell of burnt flesh"". ""The body was burned all over the front,"" including ""the face and most of her hair"", he says - but strangely it was not burnt on the back. ""It looked like she had thrown herself back"" from a fire, he says, adding that she was so badly burnt they could not imagine what she originally looked like. The scene is cold by the time Carl arrived, so he cannot tell how long the body has been there for. And how did the woman end up on fire? Clue two: The objects Police find a number of objects at the scene, including jewellery, a watch, a broken umbrella and some bottles. But it is the positioning of the objects that leaves the strongest impression on Tormod Bønes, one of the forensic investigators. The woman is not wearing the watch or her jewellery - instead, they have been placed beside her. ""The placement and location of the objects surrounding the body was strange - it looked like there had been some kind of ceremony,"" he says. Police also find the remains of a pair of rubber boots and nylon stockings. ""She had been wearing a lot of clothes - of synthetic materials - and all the clothes had been heavily burned,"" says Tormod. Adding to the mystery is the fact that the production labels have been cut off her clothes and rubbed off the bottles at the scene. Police find nothing at the scene to indicate who the woman was. Police issue an appeal for eyewitnesses. They say the woman was about 164cm (5ft 4.5 inches) tall, with ""long brownish-black hair"", a small round face, brown eyes, and small ears. She appeared to be aged between 25 and 40 years, and wore her hair ""in a ponytail tied with a blue and white print ribbon"" at the time of death. Without a name, the woman becomes known as the Isdal Woman. The story is big news in Bergen - a peaceful town with a low crime rate. A few days later, police find a clue. Clue three: The suitcases They find two suitcases at Bergen railway station's left luggage department. One of the suitcases contains prescription-free glasses - and a fingerprint on one of the pairs matches the woman's. The suitcases also contain: Initially, police ""were very optimistic because they thought the suitcases would help them identify the body,"" says Tormod. But soon, they realise that ""all the labels that could have identified the woman, her clothes or belongings, had been removed"". Even the prescription sticker on the eczema cream, which would have shown the name of the doctor and the patient, has been scraped off. Police try hard to trace the woman's belongings. They even contact several major department stores abroad, including Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to see if the stores recognise any of packaging on the woman's make up. None of the department stores can find a match. There is also a mysterious coded note in the case - which police will not crack until a while later (see clue five). There is one important piece of evidence in the suitcase - a plastic bag from Oscar Rørtvedt's Footwear Store - a shoe shop in Stavanger. The owner's son, Rolf Rørtvedt, remembers selling a pair of rubber boots to ""a very well dressed, nice-looking woman with dark hair"". The boots he sold her appear to match the boots found on the body in the Isdalen valley. Police believe that the umbrella found near the body was also bought from the store. Rolf says the woman had made an impression on him because she ""took a long time"" choosing her boots - much longer than the average customer. She spoke English, with an accent, and had ""a calm and quiet expression"", he tells the BBC. He also recalls a strong smell emanating from the woman - which, later, he thinks may have been garlic. Using his description, police are able to trace the woman to St Svithun hotel nearby - where she checked in as Fenella Lorch. The problem? Fenella Lorch wasn't her real name. Clue four: The hotel forms It emerges that the woman had stayed in several hotels in Norway - using different aliases. And since most hotels required guests to show a passport and fill in a check-in form, this means she would have had several fake passports. Police find the woman had stayed in the following hotels, under these names: The woman left a strong impression on Alvhild Rangnes, who was a 21-year-old waitress at Hotel Neptun at the time. ""My first impression of her was one of elegance and self-assuredness,"" she tells the BBC. ""She looked so fashionable - I wished to be able to mimic her style. In fact, I remember her winking at me… from my perspective it felt as though she thought I had been staring a bit too much at her."" ""On one occasion while I was serving her, she was in the dining hall, sitting right next to - but not interacting with - two German navy personnel, one of which was an officer."" Police question several hotel staff who met the Isdal Woman - including Alvhild. They learn that, in addition to speaking English, the woman also used some German phrases. They also learn that the woman often requested a change of room - on one occasion, she asked to change rooms three times. Clue five: The note By now, there are several rumours that the woman was a spy. There weren't too many foreign tourists in Bergen then - and the fact the woman seemed wealthy, and well-travelled, sparked a lot of speculation. ""This was during the Cold War, and there were definitely a lot of spies in Norway, including Russian spies,"" says Gunnar Staalesen, a Bergen-based crime author who was a university student at the time. There were also Israeli agents operating in Norway - as shown three years later, when Mossad agents killed a man in Lillehammer they had mistaken for a terrorist, he adds. Norwegian intelligence services are investigating too - but will not admit it until decades later. According to NRK, security services were interested in reports that the woman had been seen observing the military test out new rockets in western Norway - but there weren't any clear conclusions from their investigation reports. Police eventually crack some of the coded note - but it doesn't provide any evidence that she's a spy. Instead, it appears to be a record of the places the woman visited. For example, O22 O28 P are dates (22-28 October) she was in Paris, O29PS is the day she travelled from Paris to Stavanger, O29S matches the date she arrived in Stavanger (29 October), and O30BN5 matches her stay in Bergen from 30 October to 5 November. Police send a description of the woman, and sketches of what she may have looked like, to several police forces abroad. But none of them say they can identify the woman. Clue six: The autopsy Meanwhile, investigators complete an examination of the woman's body. They find an unexplained bruise on the right side of her neck, that could have been the result of a blow or a fall. There are no signs that the woman had been ill. The autopsy also finds that the woman had never been pregnant or had a child. Her death is likely to have been a painful one. ""There were smoke particles in her lungs… which shows that the woman was alive while she was burning,"" Tormod says. He found a trace of petrol in the ground below the woman's body, which means ""we can state with certainty that petrol had been used"" to set her alight. She had a high concentration of carbon monoxide in her blood. Experts also establish that there were about 50-70 sleeping pills, from a foreign brand called Fenemal, in her stomach - although they had not been fully absorbed into her bloodstream before she died. The autopsy concludes the woman died from a combination of carbon monoxide poisoning, and ingesting a large number of sleeping pills. The cause of death is announced to be a probable suicide - a view supported by Bergen's chief of police. But many people find this hard to believe. ""We talked about it in the police, but as far as I remember very few thought it was suicide,"" Carl Halvor Aas says. Both the remote spot where her body was found - and the method of suicide, by fire, strike him as strange. Without any further leads, the case is closed, and the woman is buried in February 1971. Police think the woman may be Catholic, and organise a Catholic funeral for her. According to a police report of the funeral, the coffin was decorated with lilacs and tulips, and the priest conducted a simple ceremony for ""the unknown woman, who was put to the grave in a foreign country without any family present"". Police still hope to find the woman's family - she is buried in a zinc coffin that won't decompose - and keep an album of photos from the funeral for her relatives. Harald Osland was one of the investigators reluctant to let the case go. ""My father could never put this case away,"" his son, Tore, says. ""He never could accept that they had to close down the case."" His father kept several of the police documents, and Tore eventually wrote a book about the Isdal case. Over the years, the case has also inspired several crime writers and illustrators. ""What intrigues people is that it is an unsolved mystery - it is almost like following a crime novel,"" says Gunnar Staalesen. Then, in 2016, the possibility of solving the case rears its head again. Clue eight: The teeth The Isdal Woman had distinctive teeth - 14 of them were filled - and she had several gold crowns. This was especially unusual for someone in her age range - and is not the type of dental work seen in Norway. Gisle Bang, a professor of dentistry, keeps the woman's jaw, in the hope that other experts will recognise the dental work. After his death, everyone assumes the jaw has been destroyed. Forensic doctor Inge Morild, who inherited the Isdal Woman files, says he was told the jaw had been ""thrown away because it was smelling"". But after investigative journalists at NRK make queries about the Isdal Woman, Prof Morild finds the jaw - deep in a cellar in Haukeland University Hospital's forensic archives. The find gives Norwegian police the opportunity to re-open the case, and use the latest forensic techniques to try and identify the woman. The Norwegian Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) and University of Bergen start conducting isotope analysis on her teeth - looking at the chemical ""signature"" left by the elements that made up her teeth as they were being formed. The tests involve: It's the first time Norwegian police have conducted isotope analysis on teeth - but they hope the findings will help them pinpoint the region where the woman lived. Clue nine: The tissue samples DNA analysis is now one of the key tools police use in forensic analysis and identification cases. It didn't exist back in 1970. But it turns out several tissue samples from the woman's organs, including from her lungs, heart, adrenal gland and ovaries, have been stored at Haukeland University Hospital. Prof Morild says it ""has been a custom in most of Norway"" to keep tissue samples from post mortem examinations. The samples are ""useful for repeat examinations, and as a source of DNA"". NRK and local police agree to send the samples off for DNA analysis. Nils Jarle Gjøvåg, head of forensics at West Police District, says it's important to pursue the woman's identity because ""somewhere in the world, there may be some relatives wondering where she went"". ""We try to identify every unknown body, so that relatives can have an answer."" While they wait for DNA results, NRK publish a documentary into the investigation - and receive more than 150 tip offs from people interested in the case. ""In Norway, this case is a big enigma for people… there's a lot of people who want some sort of closure in the case,"" says journalist Ståle Hansen. After months of work, scientists have an extended DNA profile of the woman. The latest results, published on Friday, show the woman was of European descent - making the theory that the woman was an agent from Israel much less likely. Norwegian police are set to issue an Interpol black notice - which seeks information on unidentified bodies - with the new information. European police forces will be asked to check their DNA databases to see if they find a match. ""If someone in her close family is in a DNA registry somewhere, we will get a hit,"" says Ståle Hansen. ""That would be really exciting."" The Isdal Woman case has been unsolved for the last 46 years. But now, modern science has reopened the possibility of this elusive Nordic mystery being solved. Readers who recognise the Isdal Woman or want to share tips about the case of the Isdal Woman can contact the NRK investigative team via their website.

"A report revealed the financial impact of the contract termination on Dumfries and Galloway Council last year. A BBC Freedom of Information (FOI) request about the deal was refused by the local authority in December. The council was asked to look again at that decision, but a review has ruled the details should not be released. In November, a best value assurance study of the local authority prepared for the Accounts Commission highlighted the financial impact of ending the PFI deal. 'Breach of confidence' The BBC's FOI request asked for details of why the council faced such costs when it was the private company who wished to end the contract. It also asked if the authority expected in future to face similar losses to those incurred by the firm which had been running the service. The council rejected the request, saying it did hold the information but its release could ""prejudice substantially"" the ""effective conduct of public affairs"". The BBC asked it to review that decision but it reached the same conclusion. In addition the council concluded that releasing the details would ""constitute a breach of confidence"".",A council review has concluded it was justified in withholding details of why it cost it £6.5m to end a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) waste deal.
"Taylor Patterson, 22, was also slashed in the neck with a machete outside a shop in Rumney, Cardiff, in April. Keiron Hassan, 32, of Ely and Kamal Legall, 26, of Fairwater, are accused of attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing a sawn-off shotgun without authority. They both denied the charges at Newport Crown Court. Mr Legall also denies failing to provide a key to protected information. Prosecutor Christopher Rees described it as a ""murderous attack"" outside a Lifestyle Express store in Harris Avenue in broad daylight. He said the defendants hid the shotgun in a children's playground in Cardiff Bay and used ""cloned"" number plates on a Nissan Pathfinder to hide its identity. ""It was professionally planned and executed in a gangland-style hit where the clear intention was to the kill the victim Taylor Patterson,"" he said. ""The attackers took advantage of the pandemic in that they wore masks to hide their identity. ""Two lethal weapons were used, a machete used to strike blows to the neck and a sawn-off shotgun fired at close point-blank range."" He said the fact it took place ""in broad daylight"" may have been to ""send a message to others and to strike fear into a local community"". Mr Patterson had driven to the shop to buy two bottles of Lucozade, when he saw two men running towards him. ""He was struck with a machete and fell face down, it looked like the man was aiming to kill him. Patterson was screaming for help,"" Mr Rees said. The other man shot Mr Patterson before driving off in his car, jurors were told. 'Life-saving surgery' The victim was taken to the city's University Hospital of Wales, and treated for injuries, including a five-inch neck wound, and fractures to his left femur. He underwent surgery for five hours, which included blood transfusions that saved his life, the court heard. During a video interview with police, Mr Patterson said he recognised his attackers as Mr Hassan, with the machete, and Mr Legall with the shotgun, adding Mr Hassan had shouted at him: ""Where's my watch?"" Mr Legall's DNA was linked to shotgun cartridges, fragments of blue latex gloves, the shotgun and pistol and Hassan's to the false number plates. Following their arrest Mr Hassan and Mr Legall both denied their involvement. They said they had been in the Nissan Pathfinder, following the shooting, after being approached by a man named ""Paddy"" who asked them if they wanted to buy the vehicle. Both defendants said they agreed to test drive the car but later returned to an agreed spot and told Paddy they did not want to buy it The trial continues.","A man was shot at close range with a sawn-off shotgun in a ""gangland-style hit"", a court has heard."
"Despite the rain, shoppers were queuing up as stores reopened across the country. Dundee A bustling Dundee city centre welcomed the reopening of many businesses with steady queues at larger stores including Zara and Primark, writes Graeme Ogston. Linsey Christison and Lori Fraser were among the mid-morning Primark shoppers. Linsey said: ""We queued for about 15 minutes to get into the shop and it moved quite quickly. We've been looking forward to it. Lori said: Everyone is in great spirits, nobody's stressed looking. Normally nobody speaks when they're out, but everybody's been saying hi."" Louise Brown, co-owner of Forever Curves clothing boutique in the Nethergate, said she was ""excited"" to reopen after a three-month ""nightmare"" closure. She said: ""We're quite prepared for it, but just a wee bit worried about how quickly it's going to pick up. ""We've been trying to update people through Facebook, but we've not done any orders through it, we've just been completely closed. ""We've got a few regulars who said they might pop in later in the week."" Dumfries Bustling is not an adjective many people would associate with Dumfries town centre on a Monday morning in June, writes Giancarlo Rinaldi. However, there was definitely a steadier stream of shoppers on the high street than there has been for some time. Instead of the head-down, hurry past of the early days of lockdown, people actually appeared willing to stop and chat. Loreburn Centre manager Jim Ireland said things had been ""pretty torrid"" for stores in his retail complex over the past few months so this was a welcome situation. ""It is the busiest I have seen it,"" he said. ""I have been out and about every day since lockdown just walking up and down the street checking on the numbers seeing what is going on. ""It is very, very noticeable today there were a lot more people about first thing this morning. It is starting to pick up."" There were few queues outside stores but, nonetheless, the main thoroughfare and side streets did have a bit of a buzz. And, for anyone out of practice in the art of shopping, there were town centre ""ambassadors"" on hand to help them get to grips with the ""new normal"". Edinburgh Shoppers in Edinburgh said they were ""ecstatic"" as non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen, writes Angie Brown. Some said they felt relief that normality was returning to their city while others hoped to snap up bargains. But torrential rain seemed to have stopped people forming large queues outside shops on Monday morning, and some shoppers were disappointed that not all stores had reopened. Olaf Zarzyka, 17, from Edinburgh, said he had gone to bed early so he could get up and be in the city centre by 0700. ""It's cool because it feels like normal life is coming back,"" he said. ""I wanted to come into town to see what there was and it has made me feel happy and good. ""I've texted all my friends to tell them to come as there are no queues."" However, 65-year-old Eleanor Cotter said she was disappointed that all shops were not open in the city centre. She said: ""I came to buy make-up that you can only get in some shops. ""I was dropped off at John Lewis but it was shut, so my next port of call was Harvey Nichols - but it was closed too. When I looked through the windows it was completely empty. ""I'm not able to get the make-up brands I want. I got some food at M&S, but now I've had enough because all the shops aren't open so I'm going home again."" Glasgow A queue formed outside Glasgow's Primark store on Argyle Street at about 05:50 even though it was not due to open its doors until 08:00. BBC Scotland reporter Graham Stewart said there were about 100 people waiting for the store to open. He said: ""Many customers said they were shopping for essentials like underwear and socks - others were just happy to get out the house and back to some normality. ""No-one I have spoken to has health concerns, although a small number are wearing masks."" Colin McLean, general manager of Debenhams said: ""There has been a lot of work over the last few weeks to follow the guidelines. ""We have hosts at the entrances and social distancing measures. We have screens at the till points and yellow and black signage throughout the store. ""As a chain we have purchased 11,000 units of PPE to make sure our colleagues are safe, secure and confident. ""I was happy to see how positive the staff were. They are wearing visors because they are much more comfortable."" Aberdeen In Aberdeen, queues outside Primark formed early for an 08:30 opening. The store was able to reopen because it has an on-street entrance and exit. However, shops inside shopping malls have to wait a bit longer as they are unable to open until 13 July.","After 14 weeks of lockdown, Scotland's non-essential retailers emerged from the coronavirus lockdown on Monday."
"Guidelines published on Thursday said BBC News employees shouldn't attend marches about ""controversial issues"". Some were reportedly told that meant they may not be able to join Pride events, which support LGBTQ+ rights. But Mr Davie has said journalists could attend if they were not ""taking a stand on politicised or contested issues"". Aimed at maintaining the broadcaster's impartiality, the new guidance said employees should not ""express a personal opinion on matters of public policy, politics, or controversial subjects"". Mr Davie told staff on Friday: ""There is no ban on attending Pride parades. ""The guidance that we published yesterday made it very clear that staff outside of news and current affairs and factual journalism may attend marches, demonstrations and protests as private individuals... ""There are different considerations for staff who work in news and current affairs and factual journalism (and senior leaders) but I want to be clear that there is no issue for these staff attending community events that are clearly celebratory or commemorative and do not compromise perceptions of their impartiality. ""If news and current affairs staff are participating in such events they must be mindful of ensuring that they do not get involved in matters which could be deemed political or controversial. There is no ban on these staff attending Pride events. ""Attending Pride parades is possible within the guidelines, but due care needs to be given to the guidance and staff need to ensure that they are not seen to be taking a stand on politicised or contested issues."" 'Created ambiguity' Mr Davie said commentary in the press and online on Thursday saying staff would be banned from Pride was ""inaccurate"". BBC LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte said many people on social media were left ""questioning why it took so long for the BBC to provide this reassurance to staff and audiences"". Hunte said: ""LGBT staff at the BBC have told me that they are concerned that this statement has come far too late to undo the anger, resentment and confusion that was allowed to take hold for nearly 18 hours."" In response to Mr Davie's statement, the organisers of Pride In London said Mr Davie's message had ""created ambiguity"". The event's director of communications Rhammel O'Dwyer-Afflick told the PA news agency: ""While we welcome the news that all BBC staff can attend Pride events, we are concerned that the handling of this announcement and the policy itself have created ambiguity about the degree to which BBC employees can publicly show support for the rights of LGBT+ people. ""The rights of trans people, queer people of colour and black trans individuals in particular should not be up for debate. ""All BBC employees should be able to freely attend events in support of trans communities, such as Pride, as well as Black Lives Matter protests without fear of repercussions."" 'Much distress' Broadcasting union Bectu said the new rules had caused ""confusion and distress"". Bectu head Philippa Childs said: ""We are frankly dismayed that unions were not properly consulted prior to the publication of such an important document. ""There is a huge amount of confusion and conjecture regarding what the guidelines mean and this is causing much distress amongst the Bectu membership and the workforce more generally."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has called for an urgent meeting with Mr Davie to discuss the guidelines. General secretary Michelle Stanistreet said she wanted to ""address our members' concerns about the changes which could constrain individuals' ability to meaningfully participate and engage in issues that matter to them - whether that's in their trade union, their communities or in events such as Pride"". The new guidance also covers the use of social media, whether professionally or personally, in an attempt to avoid perceptions of bias; and said a new register of external and corporate work done by presenters, and how much they were paid, would be established.

"By Bill WilsonBusiness reporter, BBC News Now it faces a new challenge, as US based activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital, which owns just over 10% stake in the firm, has been pressing for a seat on Rolls-Royce's board. While ValueAct describes itself as driving ""value-creating strategies"", management at Rolls-Royce has previously called the investor an ""opportunist"". ValueAct, which is now Rolls-Royce's biggest shareholder, is also reported to want the British firm to focus on its main aero-engine business, which accounts for about half of profits, and to offload its unit which makes marine engines. The marine business makes engines and nuclear reactors for ships, submarines and the offshore oil and gas industry, while the aero business makes engines for passenger jets built by Boeing and Airbus. 'Undervalued' companies' Based in San Francisco, ValueAct was founded in 2000 by Jeffrey Ubben, its chief executive and chief investment officer, ""to manage the capital of its founders, along with the capital of a limited number of outside investors"". Mr Ubben is an ex-mutual fund manager at Fidelity and has served as a director at more than 20 companies, including Sara Lee. ValueAct says it manages more than $19bn (£12.6bn) on behalf of some of the world's most respected institutional and individual investors. The fund usually makes about three to four new investments a year, and has a reported $3.3bn (£2.2bn) stake in Microsoft. It says it ""concentrates on acquiring significant ownership stakes in companies it believes are fundamentally undervalued"". ValueAct explains that ""such companies may be temporarily mispriced for a variety of reasons, including perceived unfavourable industry conditions, poor business performance, changes in management or ownership, reorganizations, or other external factors. ""These conditions can often result in fundamentally ""good"" businesses that are available at depressed valuations."" Which is no doubt how ValueAct would say it sees Rolls-Royce. Last week ValueAct nearly doubled its holding to 10.01%, making it by far the largest investor in Rolls-Royce, and giving more impetus to its request to take a seat on the board and cut costs. 'Farm team' On its website, the San Francisco-based fund says it ""works constructively with management and the company's board to implement value-creating strategies"". Some major Rolls investors are reported to be supportive of ValueAct, believing its presence could provide insight that it is lacking at present. As well as profit warnings seeing its share price fall by close to 40% in 2015, Rolls-Royce still has Serious Fraud Office investigations into bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world, hovering over it. Despite this the firm is obviously of interest to ValueAct, which at any given time has a portfolio of ten to 18 core company investments, as well as a small ""farm team"" of additional investments in development. But running such a diverse operation is not without potential pitfalls. On Monday, ValueAct said its fund had fallen by 8.3% during the third quarter, erasing its gains for the year. It had been hit by a drop in shares of a main portfolio company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.","UK engineering firm Rolls-Royce has faced a number of problems over the past two years, having found itself making five profit warnings as its stock price has taken a hammering."
"By Greg CochraneNewsbeat music reporter For Little Mix that means a contract with Simon Cowell's record label and, now, a decent chance of securing a Christmas number one with their cover of Damien Rice's Cannonball. Seventeen-year-old Amelia Lily finished third in the competition with Marcus Collins the runner-up. They may not have lifted this year's crown, but new figures from the Official Charts Company show that making it to the final is often all you need to launch a successful career. Albums success The most successful X Factor graduate in terms of UK album sales has been Leona Lewis, the competition's winner in 2006. Between her two albums (2007's Spirit and 2009's Echo) the 26-year-old Londoner has sold 3,730,000 records in the UK. But winning isn't everything. Only twice has the winner sold more albums than another finalist in the competition's seven-year history. Last year's winner Matt Cardle told Newsbeat: ""There's a lot of pressure releasing singles and albums anyway. ""Even more so off the back of X Factor and especially being a male and given the male track record. I just want to do the best I can."" Since Leona Lewis's win (2006) a runner-up or third placed contestant has gone on to sell more albums than the champion, including the last four years in a row. Those acts are Rhydian (runner-up 2007), JLS (runner-up 2008) Olly Murs (runner-up 2009) and One Direction (third place 2010). Covers But, that's not to say the careers of the winners have faltered. For example, JLS may have come second to competition winner Alexandra Burke in 2008, but her debut solo album Overcome has still sold 800,000 copies in the UK. Figures from last year's final three are still changing. To date Matt Cardle's album Letters has sold 160,000 copies and One Direction's Up All Night 220,000. Understandably sales of singles and other tracks paint a different picture - an important reason being the boost the winner's single initially gets heading into the Christmas period. Going back at the start, runners-up in the first series of The X Factor in 2004 G4 may have sold more albums, but victor Steve Brookstein has sold more singles. The same goes for 2005 winner Leon Jackson. He sold more than 15 times the number of singles as second place Rhydian. Alexandra Burke, winner in 2008, has sold more singles than runners-up JLS by a margin of more than 100,000. And Matt Cardle, who released a cover of Biffy Clyro's Many Of Horror following his victory last year, has sold almost double the number of singles as teen heart-throbs One Direction. Of course, it's not just the finalists who can go on to fashion successful recording careers. Cher Lloyd and Diana Vickers, neither of which reached the final in their years, have both scored UK number 1 singles. The day after the final, that's the kind of encouragement that suggests we may still see more from the likes of Misha B, Amelia Lily and Marcus Collins yet.","In front of a live crowd of 10,000 and a TV audience of millions, Little Mix became the eighth winner of The X Factor on Sunday night (11 December)."
"Developer Stanhope said the delay at Old Market was due to ""exceptional weather"" earlier in the year and the subsequent impact on building works. Waitrose, Debenhams and TK Maxx will now open on 9 May, with other retailers and restaurants to follow. Stanhope added the centre would deliver 18 big-name retail brands, eight restaurants and a six-screen cinema. It said Old Market was 93% let and under offer. Retail landlord British Land, which has funded the centre, will manage the scheme from the opening of the first stores, Stanhope added. The revamp of the old market site also includes a car park for 600 vehicles and new public squares.","The first stores in a new £90m shopping centre will open in Hereford next month, three weeks later than planned."
"Fiona Hyslop was speaking as the prime minister started a second day of talks in Brussels. Mr Cameron is trying to secure the deal he wants ahead of holding an in/out referendum on the UK's EU membership. But Ms Hyslop said the focus should be on the EU's ""positive influence"" rather than the ""minutia"" of the summit. Mr Cameron has said he would be ""battling for Britain"" during the Brussels summit, which started on Thursday and has now resumed for a second day. But he has stressed he would not agree to a deal that ""doesn't meet what we want"". European Council President Donald Tusk said there had been ""some progress"" but ""a lot still remains to be done"" despite Thursday's negotiations going on through the night. Mr Cameron's Eurosceptic critics have branded the process a sham, saying that even if the reforms are agreed they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or affect the scale of EU migration. The SNP government and all four opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament want the UK to remain a member of the EU. And polls have suggested the EU is more popular in Scotland than elsewhere in the UK. Ms Hyslop told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""This is high stakes by David Cameron, but I think it is probably low impact in terms of the changes he will get. ""He is risking putting Scotland at the exit door of the European Union and that is just not acceptable."" Analysis by Struan Stevenson, former Scottish Conservative MEP If this is political theatre, it is certainly putting David Cameron through the ringer - the talks went on until about 05:00 Brussels time. I have sat through some of these all-night meetings in Brussels before. Tempers get increasingly frayed and they were going to go back into a session at about 10:00 Brussels time this morning. They will have had very little sleep, they will be a bit grumpy and many people are saying this is the last opportunity for getting a deal. If we don't get a deal today we are going to have to come back to a special summit, probably later this month, or there is a scheduled summit on 17 March. People will come back to those summits and they are going to be increasingly angry with Britain for creating this hiatus. This is history in the making, and I really hope that they do come to a decision today. Many people speculated that it would be what they call a two-shirt summit meeting, some even said it could go on until Saturday and be a three-shirt summit meeting. But I think they will probably come to their senses later today. Ms Hyslop added: ""At the end of the day what is going to be on the ballot when we get to the referendum will be about whether we want to remain or whether we want to leave. ""And it is the bigger picture that I think is far more important in terms of the future. ""We have had 40 years of being part of the European Union and we think that is a positive influence not just for us but for the rest of the world, and we should be getting on to that agenda rather than the detail, the minutia, of the negotiations."" Ms Hyslop said she believed that everybody involved in the Brussels talks wanted a deal to be done. But she defended the Scottish government's refusal to campaign alongside Mr Cameron for the UK to remain in the EU, saying its vision of Europe's future was ""very different"" from that of the prime minister. And she denied there was a contradiction between wanting to remain a part of the EU while wanting to leave the United Kingdom. UKIP has pledged to campaign in Scotland for a so-called Brexit, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has predicted could spark a second referendum on Scottish independence. Earlier this week, a leading expert on the EU said Holyrood would be handed a raft of new powers over areas such as the environment, agriculture and fishing if the UK was to leave the EU. What does Mr Cameron want from the summit? The key parts of the UK's proposed deal include:","David Cameron is playing a high stakes game that risks leaving Scots ""at the exit door of the EU"", Scotland's external affairs secretary has said."
"She described the support provided for terminally ill children, by the centre in Kuala Lumpur, as ""life-changing"". The duchess and her husband travelled to Malaysia from Singapore, where they had begun their nine-day tour of South East Asia to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. She said the couple were ""hugely excited"" to be in Malaysia. They were given a guided tour of the hospice, meeting staff and patients. The duchess sat with 15-year-old leukaemia sufferer Zakwan Anuar, who had postponed a blood transfusion in order to meet the royal. Asking him about his treatment, she said: ""You must be very, very brave. Are you in pain? You're a brave boy. Thank you so much for coming to see me."" Zakwan told the duchess that she was ""very pretty"", to which she replied: """"Thank you. You're very handsome."" Afterwards, the boy's mother, Norizan Sulong, said: ""Zakwan is normally very sleepy and in pain, crying, almost giving up hope, but today - my God - it was as if the leukaemia had gone."" She added: ""God bless her. I cannot repay that kindness."" 'Special place' In her speech, the duchess said she had learned the importance of the care provided by such centres through her role as patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices. ""Providing children and their families with a place of support, care and enhancement at a time of great need is simply life changing,"" she said. ""With effective palliative care lives can be transformed. Treatment, support, care and advice can provide a lifeline to families at a time of great need. ""This is a very special place and so much has already been achieved"". Institutions dedicated to providing palliative treatment for those with terminal illnesses are rare in Malaysia and across the Far East. Doctor Ednin Hamzah, the chief executive of Hospis Malaysia, said the presence of the duchess and the duke at the hospice would send a message across the region about the importance of such facilities. 'Warmth and connection' He said: ""I think the duchess could become the champion for the hospice movement worldwide if she wants to take on that mantle. ""She is very natural with the patients, you can see a warmth and connection there"". The royal couple arrived in the country on a scheduled Malaysian Airlines flight, before meeting Prime Minister Najib Razak at his official residence. Their last engagement in Singapore was to visit a memorial for Commonwealth casualties from World War II, where they laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The couple are scheduled to visit a Malaysian tropical jungle, on Borneo island, before heading to the Solomon Islands on Saturday. They will finish their tour in Tuvalu.","The Duchess of Cambridge has given her first official speech abroad, while visiting a hospice in Malaysia."
"It includes £330bn in loans, £20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines is also being considered. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told a press conference it was an ""economic emergency. Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one."" And he promised that if this package was not enough, he would go further. From the hospitality industry to the airline sector, companies have warned that their long term survival is under threat. Mr Sunak said: ""This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy, this is a time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this. ""That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms. ""And if demand is greater than the initial £330bn [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes, and I meant it,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the same media briefing that ""we must do whatever it takes to support the economy"". He added: ""This a time to be bold, to have courage. We will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses... We will do whatever it takes."" Mr Sunak said: ""Some sectors are facing particularly acute challenges. In the coming days, my colleague the Secretary of State for Transport and I will discuss a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports."" The chancellor said he was extending the business rates holiday to all firms in the hospitality sector and funding grants of between £10,000 and £25,000 for small businesses. And Mr Sunak said that for those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three-month mortgage holiday. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz said it was important for borrowers to remember that they would have to make up the payments at a later date. ""The result is that you have some breathing space but when you resume payments the amount will be adjusted to be slightly higher, because the missed interest payments have been added to the loan,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean the mortgage holiday is a bad idea."" 'No time for ideology' The chancellor unveiled the measures after the government's chief scientific adviser said about 55,000 people in the UK now have Covid-19, as the NHS moved to cancel all non-emergency surgery and 71 people are now known to have died. ""Whatever it takes"" was the promise from the chancellor to support businesses, families and individuals through the coronavirus crisis. It was a phrase successfully used by a European central banker eight years ago - and effectively calmed a significant eurozone crisis. But this intervention is a bigger bazooka than that, because the challenge of coronavirus and the measures to contain it pose to peoples livelihoods and wellbeing are more significant. The extraordinary figure here was £330bn in state-backed loans for all businesses through the banking system with the help of the Bank of England. That is 15% of the value of the economy. Normally economic announcements are worth a fraction of a percent of national income - this move is about a fraction of our entire GDP. And that is because the self-isolation and suppression moves announced yesterday will remove a chunk of our economy. At a stroke, every single forecast number in the Budget the chancellor gave less than a week ago are out of date. We are in an entirely new world. A wartime effort, with wartime deficits to cover it. It's not just there will be less tax and more income support required, which typically causes deficits to spike in recessions. Now we face the need for subsidy and provision of incomes in these very tough times. This is not a bailout. It's a very expensive bridge that the government cannot afford to fail to build. Companies and trade bodies welcomed the announcement, but said they needed to work through the fine print. Like several sectors, the aviation industry has warned it is in a fight for survival as travel bans are put in place and travellers delays bookings. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of Easyjet, said Mr Sunak's measure were welcome, but added: ""Airlines are facing significant pressure and without government action there is a real risk to the industry. It will be important to work through the detail, but we are already talking to government."" 'Not well targeted' Retailers, too, have warned the future looks grim without help. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the new measures would help ease the burden. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The business rates holiday, together with the announcement of a loan package, represent a vital shot in the arm for a sector facing enormous uncertainty. We still need to see the details and make sure that retailers can access cash with the minimum of delay, but it is a welcome and necessary first step to protect jobs. Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely important . is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said the business rates holiday was targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. But he warned: ""This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go."" He said it may be necessary to cut employer national insurance contributions, delay increases to the National Living Wage, and increase support for individuals through Universal Credit.

"Bridget Jones's Baby, says the Mirror's David Edwards, is ""a laughathon"" that fans should ""watch at all costs"". Renee Zellweger plays Helen Fielding's perennial singleton for the third time in the film, which this time sees its scatty heroine become pregnant. Zellweger joined co-stars Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey at Monday's launch. The pair play romantic partners of Zellweger's character, either of whom could be the father of her unborn child. Emma Thompson and pop star Ed Sheeran also appear in the film, which is out in the UK on 16 September. According to The Guardian, Bridget Jones's Baby is ""a better Bridget than the last movie"" - 2004's Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. It is, Peter Bradshaw's review continues, ""something resembling a likeable, good-natured one-off TV holiday special"". Jamie East in The Sun writes: ""The third in the Bridget Jones series has everything we love about her films. ""Nearly all the cast is back, jokes are razor-sharp and cultural references are on point."" One notable absentee is Hugh Grant, who chose not to reprise his role as the caddish Daniel Cleaver. His absence, says Variety's Catherine Bray, ""is certainly felt"" in ""a mixed bag"" that ""doesn't quite hit the heights"" of 2001's Bridget Jones's Diary. ""Depending on which side of the age divide viewers fall, Bridget Jones's Baby will either be viewed as charmingly retro or irredeemably irrelevant,"" writes Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan. The film, she continues, ""works best as a nostalgia piece, to help viewers recall where they were in the late 1990s when the world thought it was charming for a woman to be so prettily inept"". Meanwhile, Leslie Felperin writes in The Hollywood Reporter: ""There are crisply folded lines, and pleasingly peppery performances from the supporting cast.""

"He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"". But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn. Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer. Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor, Czech prime minister and Estonian prime minister next week. Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it."" 'Positive sign' Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled. And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. ""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on."" But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed. Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure."" The 'no deal' talk continues Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"". But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless. Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue. He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said. Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade."" Earlier, Mr Raab suggested to the Sunday Telegraph that he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about £39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. 'Additional burdens' Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis. The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, told the Sunday Express the government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans.","A deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said."
"Families at the Empire Cinema in Ipswich said their children were left in tears after seeing adverts for psychological horror Ma and scary superhero flick Brightburn. Parents removed their children from the auditorium until the trailers stopped. Empire Cinemas has apologised for ""any distress caused"" and said it is investigating. The trailer for Ma features dead bodies, sexual violence and a man being hit by a car, while Brightburn features a child with a scary mask as well as blood and violence. 'Confused and crying' Charlie Jones, from Manningtree in Essex, took daughter Annie, two, for her first cinema trip, along with 10-month-old Fred. Mrs Jones, a BBC journalist, said Annie had been subdued since the experience and had asked about a mask seen in one of the trailers. She said: ""Normally I would expect her to be singing and dancing when watching something like [Peppa Pig] but she was just really subdued. ""I tried to cover her eyes during the trailers and told her they were silly films for mummies and daddies, but there were lots of kids crying and she was very confused and started crying too."" Mrs Jones, 34, said: ""I went mad at [the manager]. It was meant to be a special day for Annie. I don't think he understands the impact of it. ""Annie is very imaginative and scared of monsters and things like that at the moment. ""You go to the cinema and you expect it to be a safe family day out, you don't expect her to be exposed to anything which could do harm."" A spokeswoman for Empire Cinemas said: ""As soon as the staff on site were made aware of the situation, the programme was stopped and trailers were taken off-screen immediately. ""We do sincerely apologise for this and for any distress caused and will be reviewing our internal procedures to ascertain how this came to be.""

"By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter The Social Mobility Commission warns of many ""treadmill families running harder and harder but standing still"". It points to an unfair education system, a two-tier labour market, a regionally imbalanced economy and unaffordable housing. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to tackle social inequalities. The commission's State of the Nation 2016 report, laid before Parliament on Wednesday, says young families now can no longer expect to do as well as their parents' generation. It highlights that home ownership is in sharp decline, particularly among young people. New homes The commission urges the government to commit to building three million homes over the next decade and to expand the sale of public sector land for new homes. It should also allow targeted housebuilding on green-belt land and modify the starter home initiative to focus on households with average incomes. Analysis By Hannah Richardson BBC News education and social affairs reporter Alan Milburn paints a depressingly familiar picture of a ""them and us"" Britain divided along the fault-lines of wealth and opportunity. But the conclusion of his report - most families are now doing worse than their parents' generation - is staggering. It means social mobility is going backwards not forwards, despite successive attempts to tackle it. Phrases such as: ""Huge swathes of Britain feel left behind,"" and: ""The chickens have now come home to roost,"" pepper the report. ""So many families are struggling to get by, let alone get up,"" Mr Milburn said. He highlights that of the 65 parts of the country identified by his commission as ""social mobility coldspots"", only three voted to remain in the EU. Mr Milburn, himself immersed in issues surrounding the social mobility conundrum for six years, clearly feels the country's mood is now becoming dangerous. And with a nod to 1930s Europe, he told reporters: ""We know from the history of our own continent, when people feel they are losing out unfairly, the mood can turn ugly."" The commission notes that a child living in one of England's most disadvantaged areas is 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged areas. And young people from low-income homes are one-third more likely to drop out of education than better-off classmates with similar GCSEs. The report says the government should have ""as its core objective"" the narrowing within the next decade of the GCSE attainment gap between poorer children and their better-off classmates by two-thirds. It also urges the government to rethink its plans for more grammar schools and more academies. The report says grammars are ""at best, a distraction, and, at worst, a risk to efforts aimed at narrowing the significant social and geographical divides that bedevil England's school system"". The report notes a growing gap between the generations, warning that those born in the 1980s are the first post-war cohort not to start their working lives on higher salaries than their immediate predecessors. It says the government must work with large employers, local councils and Local Enterprise Partnerships to bring high-quality job opportunities - backed by financial incentives - to Britain's social mobility ""coldspots"". The report also calls for an end to unpaid internships, arguing that work placements lasting more than four weeks should be paid at the minimum wage. The commission says the problem is not just social, but also geographical, with a widening divide between the big cities - particularly London - and the many towns and counties being ""left behind economically and hollowed-out socially"". It says that in London, the number of top-end occupational jobs has increased by 700,000 in the past 10 years compared with just under 56,000 in the north-east of England. 'Deeply corrosive' The report warns: ""The growing sense that we have become an us and them society - where a few unfairly hoard wealth and power - is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a society. ""The EU referendum in June this year exposed deep divides that go well beyond the box that people crossed. ""Public concern - even anger - about issues of identity, immigration and inequality found a voice on 23 June and a target to aim at. ""Of the 65 parts of the country we identified as being social mobility coldspots - those with the poorest education and employment prospects - only three areas voted to remain in the EU."" Other concerns raised by the report include: The chair of the Social Mobility Commission, Alan Milburn, said the rungs on the social mobility ladder were growing further apart. ""It is becoming harder for this generation of struggling families to move up,"" he said. ""Whole sections of society and whole tracts of Britain feel left behind. ""As the EU referendum result showed, the public mood is sour and decision-makers have been far too slow to respond."" Theresa May took over as prime minister in July with a promise to lead a ""one-nation"" government that worked for all, not just the ""privileged few"". Mr Milburn said the commission applauded her determination to further social progress but warned this was a ""big ambition"" and should be the ""holy grail"" of public policy. A government spokeswoman said ministers would consider the recommendations in the report. ""We want to make this a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few - whether it's education, jobs, or housing, this means giving families more control over their lives and doing more to help those who are just managing. ""As the prime minister said on the steps of Downing Street, this government is committed to fighting injustice wherever it arises and ensuring that everyone in our country has the opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them."" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the report should make ""sobering reading"" for the Conservatives. ""Since they came to power in 2010, we have seen our country go backwards on the progress the Labour government made on social mobility,"" she said. ""The educational attainment gap between lower-income children and their wealthier classmates is getting bigger, and these children still have little chance of going into high-level professions. ""And under Theresa May we can expect more of the same: grammar schools for a select few, overcrowded classrooms for the many."" The report was published as a survey of 1,655 British adults for the commission found nearly half believed where people ended up in life was mainly down to their background and parentage. Fewer than a third (29%) of people questioned thought Britain was a country where everyone could get as far as their talent and hard work would take them. One-third of those surveyed said they could not save any money each month.

"Unlike executable program files, Javascript documents do not always trigger a security warning on Windows or require administrator access to run. Named RAA, the malware is disguised as a document and starts encrypting files immediately when opened. One security expert said the approach was likely to fool many victims. ""It's an interesting approach to ransomware,"" said Ken Munro of security company Pen Test Partners. ""Using Javascript as an attachment to an email is likely to result in many victims accidentally installing it."" The RAA ransomware was discovered by security researchers known as Benkow and JamesWT.

If opened, the ransomware sets about encrypting the victim's files and displays a ransom note written in Russian. It demands a fee of $250 (£171) for the files to be restored. In April, Microsoft reported that it had seen an increase in malware being spread through Javascript email attachments. ""It is interesting to note that an Office attachment with malicious macros typically requires two or more clicks on the document to run it. One click to open the document and another click to enable the macros,"" the firm said in a blog post. ""On the other hand, the Javascript attachments only take one or two clicks to start executing."" Protection Mr Munro said people should avoid opening attachments from unknown sources to stay safe. ""The .js (Javascript) file type is automatically blocked in some email packages, particularly Outlook,"" said Mr Munro. ""But interestingly Gmail doesn't appear to block it. Don't open unknown attachments, particularly those with a .js extension. ""While we're there, don't open macro enabled Office docs either (such as .docm and .xlsm files) - and keep your anti-virus right up to date."" Additionally, Windows can be instructed not to start the ""Windows Based Script Host"" when a .js file is double-clicked.

Often, restoring files from a back-up copy is the only way to get files back without paying - although some examples of ransomware have been cracked.","Security researchers have discovered a new strain of ransomware coded entirely in Javascript, which could increase its chances of being activated."
"The 50-year-old told The Big Issue recent health scares and time spent in prison shocked him into changing his life. Michael has made no secret of his long-time use of cannabis and has a history of drug-related arrests. However he said he had ""completely stopped"" using the drug. ""I decided to change my life and I haven't touched it,"" he said in his first print interview in five years. The Wham! star received an eight-week prison sentence in 2010 after pleading guilty to driving under the influence of drugs, following an incident where he crashed his car into a photographic shop in London. ""Jail wasn't great. I just thought, get your head down and get on with it. It turned out to be easier than I was expecting because I knew I deserved to be there,"" he said. Soap watching A year later Michael suffered from life-threatening pneumonia while on tour in Austria in November 2011. ""It was very frightening... I was just so grateful to come out alive,"" said the singer, who added it was ""a pretty horrible experience"". He had another scare last May when he fell of out his car while travelling on the M1 and was airlifted to hospital with a head injury. The star said he was now living a much more sedate lifestyle and enjoyed watching ITV soap Coronation Street. ""I watch Corrie especially because it's more of a laugh. Even when life is tragic on Coronation Street, it's still funny,"" he said. But he criticised EastEnders' for its treatment of gay characters. He said: ""I hope for their sakes and the sake of gay kids in this country, regardless of their cultural background, that EastEnders gets a clue and begins to acknowledge their responsibility and provide us with gay characters that have no reason to live in fear. We do exist."" A live album recorded during Michael's Symphonica tour is released this week, ahead of a new studio album next year. Meanwhile, BBC One is to broadcast highlights from a charity concert the singer performed in Paris in September 2012. Airing in April, it features some of Michael's favourite tracks accompanied by a 40-piece orchestra. BBC Radio 2 will also broadcast a two-part documentary going behind the scenes of the Symphonica tour on 18 and 25 March.","Singer George Michael has said he has stopped his drug-taking lifestyle and not used cannabis for ""well over a year-and-a-half""."

"The hoard of around 25 wooden writing tablets was discovered by an archaeological team at Vindolanda on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland. Consisting of letters, lists and personal correspondence, the items had been discarded towards the end of the 1st Century. Work is under way to conserve the tables and decipher the messages. A few names in the texts have already been deciphered, including that of a man called Masclus who seems to have been applying for leave (commeatus). Dr Andrew Birley, director of excavations at Vindolanda Trust, described the find as ""truly exceptional"". He said: You can never take these things for granted as the anaerobic conditions needed for their survival are very precise. ""I was fortunate enough to be involved when my father, Dr Robin Birley excavated a bonfire site of Vindolanda tablets in 1992 and I had hoped, but never truly expected, that the day might come when we would find another hoard of such preserved documents again during a day on our excavations."" Dr Robin Birley added: ""Some of these new tablets are so well preserved that they can be read without the usual infrared photography and before going through the long conservation process. ""There is nothing more exciting than reading these personal messages from the distant past.""","""Personal messages from the distant past"" have been unearthed at the site of a Roman fort."

The show also features 50 works by the late Roger Oram, who produced the Arbeia Society magazine and was an archaeologist with Tyne Wear Archives and Museums. Lindsay Allason-Jones, of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, said: "" If everybody laughed during planning meetings then the cartoon was in the exhibition. ""Many of the them are just funny, but what we also found was that for some of them you need to know the context. ""For example there's one of Trump looking like Emperor Hadrian and talking about building a wall."" Ken Hutchinson, chairman of the Friends of Segedunum and project manager, said: ""It was great fun choosing what to exhibit - the laughter of everyone during the research process has been very encouraging.""

"The incident occurred on Monday evening outside a hospital in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province. CCTV footage showed an explosion inside the sinkhole shortly after the bus and bystanders fell inside on Monday evening. Several deadly sinkholes have been reported in China in recent years. The footage from the latest incident shows the moment people waiting at a bus stop are forced to flee as the ground underneath the bus starts to cave in. A number of people gather to try to rescue the bus passengers, but are engulfed by the sinkhole as it suddenly widens. According to state media, the sinkhole stretched nearly 10m (32 feet) in diameter. It is unclear how many people were inside the bus at the time of the incident. Sinkholes in China are often blamed on construction works and the rapid pace of development in the country. In 2018, four people were killed after a sinkhole opened up on a busy pavement in the city of Dazhou, south-west China. In 2013, a similar incident killed five people at an industrial estate in the southern city of Shenzhen.",At least six people have been killed and 16 injured after an enormous sinkhole swallowed a bus and a number of pedestrians in central China.
"Murdo Fraser, Scottish Conservative finance spokesman ""The finance secretary has chosen to set the Scottish rate of income tax at the same level as elsewhere in the UK. ""We applaud this decision - we do not believe that hard-pressed families in Scotland should pay higher taxes than those elsewhere in Britain."" Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour public services and wealth creation spokeswoman ""This is the most important budget since devolution, delivered by a party who promised to stand up for Scotland against Tory austerity. ""But it doesn't deliver fairer taxes, a long term plan for Scotland or an anti-austerity alternative. Local services like our schools, roads and care of the elderly will face massive cuts."" Willie Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader ""The deputy first minister has spent his entire political life campaigning for more tax powers. And what does he do when he gets them? The answer is nothing, no change, same rate and the same as in England. ""John Swinney cannot tell Scotland that he is rejecting austerity when he is not raising a penny more even though he has the new tax powers to do something about it. Patrick Harvie, finance spokesperson for the Scottish Greens ""The decision to keep the Scottish rate of income tax the same as the UK makes sense as this devolved power does not allow a more progressive approach."" Councillor David O'Neill, Cosla president ""A cut of 3.5% is catastrophic for jobs and services within Scottish local government - because the harsh reality is that it actually translates to real job cuts that hit real families, in real communities throughout Scotland. Everyone will be hurt by this."" Andy Willox, Scottish policy convenor of the Federation of Small Businesses ""FSB has pushed hard for the reform of the out of date Scottish business rates system. Mr Swinney must be applauded for grasping this thistle and promising to deliver a tax more appropriate for the 21st century. ""Communities and businesses need help to get back on their feet. This welcome support must see local firms getting their fair share."" Ian McDougall, of Business for Scotland ""The UK has for some time lagged behind our European partners in terms of productivity levels and we are delighted that the Scottish government will continue to invest heavily in the main areas that can increase productivity, namely digital infrastructure, transport and a continued investment in the innovation sector."" Mary Alexander, deputy Scottish secretary of Unite ""The debate on the future of local government should dominate the forthcoming election campaign because we can't wait until after May to see how hard and fast the axe is going to fall. ""We have two options to try and sustain jobs and services - centralisation or local democracy. John Swinney has indicated that over the lifetime of the next parliament his party would lean towards the former so we need to know what the impact will be. Alex McLuckie, regional officer of GMB Scotland ""GMB Scotland find this budget predictable. It is the same recipe as previous budgets which have seen local government take the brunt of the cuts to budgets. Yet again services to the less fortunate within society will be under real threat. Despite the statement from the Scottish government about health, education and social work being protected every area will be affected by this budget. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium ""We are delighted that the Scottish government has listened to the retail industry and the growing chorus from across business and commercial life in Scotland who have spoken up in favour of fundamental reform of business rates, and we very much welcome the promised review of business rates."" ""The hike in the large firms rates supplement is concerning, and it now appears that larger firms operating in Scotland will be paying more in business rates than firms operating in comparable premises down south."" Ian McCall, tax partner at Deloitte in Scotland ""The Scottish government may have decided to remain with the status quo for its Scottish rate of income tax, but there are still important changes which both individuals and businesses need to prepare for ahead of next April. ""As Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) looks to define those liable to pay the SRIT, individuals should be proactive in making sure that HMRC has up-to-date information about their circumstances - it's possible that it doesn't have your most recent address, for example.

Ashley Campbell, policy and practice officer at Chartered Institute of Housing Scotland ""We welcome the Scottish government's commitment to increase the budget for affordable housing by £90m in 2016-17.

""We welcome proposals to increase land and buildings transaction tax for second homes and buy-to-let properties but would like to see more details of where the additional revenue raised will be invested. Our preference would be for these funds to be re-invested towards increasing housing supply.""

"By Catrin NyeBBC Asian Network The UK project is based on the Community Security Trust's model, which records anti-Semitic incidents. 'Tell Mama' is run by interfaith organisation Faith Matters, which says victims who have come forward range from a five-year-old to an 89-year-old. They say women are targeted more than men and the majority of incidents are online abuse. Mama stands for Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks and Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters, said he wants to see a notable change in what is considered acceptable behaviour in the UK. ""By highlighting these incidents we want people to realise that Islamophobia is equally as disgusting and poisonous as anti-Semitism and I think that people do not take it at that level right now - at least some people don't,"" said Mr Mughal. ""We need to reduce the volume of online hate towards Muslim communities, but we also need to create some framework for the police and other institutions to get them to up recording and prosecutions in this area,"" he added. Smartphone app This week Tell Mama is launching a free smartphone app to support access to the service. Three-quarters of the incidents recorded by Tell Mama occurred online, with Twitter particularly highlighted as a source of abuse. In cases of verbal or street-based abuse those behind the project say it is Islamic clothing, like hijabs, that singles people out. Other incidents include direct attempts to offend those of Muslim faith. In January a pig's head was left in the garden of an Afghan family in London. There have been a number of incidents involving pork-based items being left at mosques and in December a cross wrapped in ham was left outside the home of a Muslim family in Bingham, Nottinghamshire. Murad Alam, 39, moved his wife and two young sons out of the area following that incident. He says he was happy to deal with the police himself but he said Tell Mama was vital in bringing attention to what had happened. ""I looked online and found the service so called and told them what had happened. They contacted the media about it which was great for me; I needed people to know what had happened,"" said Mr Alam. ""To be honest I don't think Islamophobia is taken very seriously - it feels like if what had happened to me happened to a Jewish family there would have been outrage,"" he added. ""There's a sense that because of our history as Muslims, terrorist atrocities and such, people feel like we deserve the abuse,"" said Mr Alam. The 2011 census revealed there were 2.7 million Muslims in England and Wales (4.8% of the population) - compared to 1.5 million in the 2001 census (3%). The Home Office has also recently started publishing statistics for all hate-crime in England and Wales. In 2011-12 43,748 hate crimes were recorded by the police, of which 35,816 (82%) were race hate crimes and 1,621 (4%) were religion hate crimes. Comparisons The comparison with anti-Semitism is frequently mentioned when discussing this work - the Jewish community is much smaller in the UK, but has for years recorded anti-Semitic attacks. The Tell Mama project wants to carry the same weight as the Community Safety Trust (CST), which has for almost 30 years been recording incidents of anti-Semitism in the UK. The CST published its annual statistics in February and recorded 640 anti-Semitic incidents across the country in 2012, compared to 608 incidents in 2011. Of these there were 69 'violent anti-Semitic assaults' in 2012, including two classified as extreme violence; 53 incidents of damage and desecration of Jewish property; 467 incidents of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, anti-Semitic graffiti and one-off cases of hate mail; 39 direct anti-Semitic threats; and 12 cases of mass-mailed anti-Semitic leaflets or emails. Mark Gardiner of the CST said he was pleased their work could inform Tell Mama. ""CST is glad that our work countering anti-Semitism has helped Tell Mama provide the Muslim community with a proper mechanism for reporting and understanding anti-Muslim hate crimes,"" said Mr Gardiner. He said: ""It has taken CST nearly 30 years of focus and professionalism to get to where we are today, so what Tell Mama has achieved in just one year is very impressive. ""We wish Tell Mama every success for the future; and if our joint co-operation helps break down barriers between British Muslims and Jews, then all the better."" Mr Mughal is encouraging more people to report: ""We need to send a clear, straight message that this is not acceptable because to be honest those working on this project feel that in some instances Islamophobia has actually passed that dinner-party test that Baroness Warsi talked about and we think it's a bad place that we're in right now."" You can hear more on this story on the BBC Asian Network on Monday, 11 March at 13:00 GMT and 17:00 GMT or listen back on BBC iPlayer.",A government-backed project set up to monitor anti-Muslim hate has recorded 632 incidents in its first year.
"By Del CrookesNewsbeat reporter at Sonisphere Festival The Surrey band, who played this weekend's Sonisphere and T in the Park festivals, will play seven dates across the UK starting in Preston and finishing at Brixton Academy. ""It's just about getting back out there,"" said guitarist Max Helyer. ""We're looking forward to getting stuck in again and playing shows and touring for the next 18 months."" Guitarist Max Helyer said it was quite scary playing to a metal crowd: ""This is the highest we've ever been on a festival in the UK on the main stage so we're super excited."" You Me At Six released their second studio album, Hold Me Down, last year. 'Distraught' They played third on the main Apollo stage at Sonisphere before Weezer and Saturday headliners Biffy Clyro and only arrived on site a few hours before their slot. ""We flew in from Portugal this morning,"" said Max Helyer. ""We were meant to be playing a festival called Optimus Alive yesterday but that got pulled. ""It was too windy by the beach and there was too much heavy equipment on stage, so they had to pull the show. Bassist Matt Barnes added: ""Basically, the stage was going to fall down on top of us if we played, so we didn't play. They brought in two fat cranes and got the stage up just in time for 30 Seconds To Mars to play."" The band also said they were ""distraught"" after blink-182 cancelled their European tour this summer meaning their support slot was binned. Max Helyer said: ""I'm a strong believer that things happen for a reason. We're all bummed because they're one of our idol bands who we all grew up listening to. ""But, as we had to do in Australia, we had to pull out due to album reasons and that was their same reason as well. Hopefully in the near future there'll be another opportunity for us to do something like that."" The band is visiting Australia in August and September with We The Kings to make up for the cancelled shows earlier this year, when they were due to perform with Aussie metal group Parkway Drive. Deaf Havana and Lower Than Atlantis have been announced as the support acts on the You Me At Six tour of the UK.

"His lawyers had been reassured he was not a target in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, he said. Talks in Congress about wall funding - the issue behind the recent government shutdown - were a ""waste of time"". Mr Trump was interviewed by the New York Times, a paper he repeatedly described as ""failing"" in the past. The paper's interview with Mr Trump came after he contacted its publisher, AG Sulzberger. Mr Sulzberger asked the president to stop his attacks on the media last year, saying they could ""lead to violence"" against journalists. The interview with Mr Trump covered a wide range of topics: 1) The border wall ""I'll continue to build the wall, and we'll get the wall finished,"" the president said, dismissing the talks between congressional Republicans and Democrats over the impasse and implying he could declare a national emergency to ensure the barrier is built. Tapping into emergency presidential powers could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access the money and resources needed to complete the project. Critics have said the situation at the border does not constitute a true emergency and invoking one would be an abuse of power. Mr Trump has sought $5.7 billion (£4.4bn) for a wall on the southern border. The Democrats refuse to provide it, arguing it is immoral and ineffective. The divide led to the longest government shutdown in US history, which will resume on 15 February if no budget can be agreed. Mr Trump slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the interview over the border wall. ""I've actually always gotten along with her, but now I don't think I will any more,"" he said. ""I think she's doing a tremendous disservice to the country."" Ms Pelosi told reporters on Thursday there would be no money for a wall in planned border security legislation. 2) The Russia inquiry Speaking to two New York Times reporters in the Oval Office, the president said he had received assurances from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. ""Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation,"" Mr Trump said. He then suggested that he may not have spoken to him in person, adding: ""The lawyers ask him. They say: 'He's not a target of the investigation'."" It is not clear when Mr Rosenstein made the comments attributed to him by Mr Trump. Mr Rosenstein oversaw Mr Mueller's investigation until last November, when the president transferred control to acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker. Mr Rosenstein and Mr Mueller have not said whether Mr Trump is a target in the investigation. Some reports have suggested that the term ""target"" would not be used for Mr Trump because sitting presidents are immune from prosecution. Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. The president also insisted he ""never did"" speak to his long-time associate Roger Stone about stolen Democratic emails published by Wikileaks in 2016. Mr Stone has been charged with seven counts in the Mueller inquiry related to the emails - charges he denies. President Trump did however attack the FBI raid on Mr Stone's home, calling it ""a very sad thing for this country"". ""I like Roger, he's a character,"" Mr Trump said. 3) Trump's Moscow project The president said his lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been ""wrong"" to say that talks over a project to construct a Trump building in Moscow had continued up to the 2016 US election. Mr Giuliani had already rowed back on the comments, saying that he had been mistaken. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress at least three times about the project - including telling Congress that the project was dissolved in January 2016. In fact, negotiations continued through June 2016, when Mr Trump was already the Republican presidential nominee. Last month Mr Mueller's office disputed a claim in a Buzzfeed report that said Mr Trump had told Cohen to lie to Congress about when the Moscow project had ended. The Buzzfeed report also said Mr Trump had allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Mr Trump told the New York Times his last conversation about the project had been in ""early to middle"" 2016. He said Cohen might have been involved with the project ""a little bit longer than that"". ""I was running for president; I was doing really well. The last thing I cared about was building a building,"" he added. 4) His political future ""I love this job,"" Mr Trump insisted, dismissing talk he might not run for re-election in 2020. He did however tell the paper he had lost ""massive amounts of money"" working as president. He also spoke of Democratic candidates in next year's vote. California Senator Kamala Harris has had ""the best opening so far"", he said. She announced her plan to run for president last month. But another possible candidate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, had been ""hurt badly"" by Mr Trump's mockery of her claims to Native American heritage, he said. Last year Mr Trump described her as a ""fake Pocahontas"" and challenged her to take a DNA test. She did and the subsequent DNA report concluded that ""the vast majority"" of Ms Warren's ancestry was European, but ""the results strongly"" supported a Native American ancestor. ""I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility and now all of a sudden it's gone,"" Mr Trump told the New York Times.",US President Donald Trump has dismissed the federal investigation into alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 election and talks about a proposed border wall.
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter But Warren Smyth warned there will be problems if the government changes the rules at short notice. ""If we get a change of tack the day before, the impact on business and customer confidence will be significant,"" he said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has called on the government to give a week's notice of any new restrictions that may apply when the shutdown ends. The organisation - which represents more than 70,000 firms employing six million people - said the government must give businesses adequate time to prepare to reopen. ""Nine months into the pandemic, business communities are still crying out for timely information and a clear strategy from government so that they can survive and rebuild,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall. ""Delays and imprecision mean people lose their livelihoods."" Recovery The lockdown in England will run from 5 November to 2 December, but Cabinet Minister Michael Gove warned it could last longer if infection rates do not fall. Meanwhile, ministers are reviewing the tier-system that was in place before the shutdown amid suggestions that the rules may change. ""We have worked hard to support our customers to keep healthy and active which is even more important than ever this year,"" said Mr Smyth, who employs 600 people at Abbeycroft Leisure in Suffolk. ""We need clarity and a plan to help with our recovery and the future health of both our communities and our businesses."" Kym Morris and Sian Jaoko, co-directors of Earth Florists in the Wirral, are worried about whether they can reopen in time for the crucial Christmas period. The business would need to order extra flowers a week before opening the shop again to make sure they have them in stock, but they are not yet sure if they can reopen on 3 December. ""Christmas is the busiest time of the year for florists,"" Kym said. ""Opening on 3 December is a really important opportunity for us to claw back some of the revenue we've lost."" If they have to delay their reopening they fear customers will buy their seasonal wreaths from larger stores that have continued trading. The BCC has asked government to explain why businesses in sectors such as leisure, non-essential retail and beauty have been forced to close despite their efforts to comply with Covid-secure guidance. ""Businesses have played their part by working hard and spending hundreds of millions of pounds to become Covid-secure, in line with official guidance,"" said Mr Marshall. ""We must see the evidence for why many were forced to close again on 5 November, and absolute transparency on what may happen from 2 December.""","The boss of a not-for-profit social enterprise plans to reopen 19 leisure and fitness centres on 3 December, the day after lockdown in England ends."

"Its US owners say the internet has made nudity outdated, and pornographic magazines are no longer so commercially viable, the New York Times reports. Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000, official figures show. However, the magazine will still feature women in provocative poses - though not fully nude. 'Battle won' The decision was apparently taken last month at a meeting attended by Playboy founder and current editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner. Magazine executives admitted that Playboy - which was founded in 1953 - had been overtaken by the changes it pioneered, according to the New York Times. ""That battle has been fought and won,"" Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders is quoted as saying by the newspaper. ""You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free.

"Emergency crews were called out to rescue residents in Broxburn who were stranded following Thursday's heavy rain. Firefighters used boats to remove residents from their flooded homes. Many cars in the area were also up to their roofs in water. More than 20 homes in the area are believed to have been flooded. This is thought to include 17 social housing properties on Pyothall Court, and six private homes on Nicol Road. Emergency services said residents concerned about flooding had phoned in from Broxburn, Ratho and Linlithgow on Thursday evening. It said the evacuations were a ""precautionary measure"", and that no one had been injured. Water levels receded after several hours, a spokeswoman confirmed. West Lothian Council said it had assisted emergency services after a number of properties and roads, particularly in Broxburn, were affected. A council spokesman added: ""The community centre at Strathbrock Partnership Centre was opened as an emergency respite for centre for those impacted by the flood waters however no one in the end required accommodation through the night. ""A number of local roads remain closed with officers continuing to work with the emergency services this morning."" A spokesman for Scottish Canals said the Union Canal had been inspected, and that the flooding was a result of the heavy rain. His comments followed speculation on social media that the canal had burst its banks. He said: ""After carrying out inspections of the Union Canal we are confident that the flooding which took place in Broxburn last night was the result of heavy rainfall and surface water runoff that overloaded local water courses and was not caused by water leaking from, or overtopping, the canal."" Waist deep water Broxburn resident Aimee Miller said that about 19:00 on Thursday she looked out her window to see her garden completely under water. By the time her family was rescued by firefighters, she said the water was waist deep. She told Good Morning Scotland that water got into her house and was quarter of the way up the wall. Ms Miller and her partner are going to return to their home on Friday morning to assess the damage. She expected a lot of cars on the street would be written off as they had been submerged in water. Jean Hendrie, 70, had to leave her home in Pyothall Court after water came over a flood wall and poured into the property. She has gone to stay with her daughter. She said: ""Everything in the living room is ruined, the water was up to our knees. The carpets are ruined, the floors are ruined. ""The rain came on really heavy at about 17:00 and there is a burn behind the flood wall and the water came right over the wall. ""One of my neighbours was flooded and the water came right up to her kitchen worktops, and there are cars that are written off. ""We will not be able to stay here as the electricity is off, the carpet is soaked, there is silt everywhere."" She said nothing like this had happened in the 21 years she had lived there. Elsewhere in the central belt, trains were cancelled and roads closed. ScotRail warned that services across the country would be delayed or cancelled due to ""extremely heavy rain flooding"". On Friday, the rail company tweeted that all lines affected by Thursday's heavy rain have now reopened, and services are able to run again. Floodwater also closed some roads in the east end of Glasgow. Traffic Scotland said the A77 near the A751, Cairnryan, Dumfries and Galloway, were restricted in both directions due to surface water affecting the carriageway.",A clean-up operation has begun after homes were flooded in the West Lothian area.
"Earlier this month NHS Lanarkshire identified the site on a shortlist, along with Gartcosh and Glenmavis. It has now confirmed that the board's recommendation has been approved by Health Secretary Jeane Freeman. The next stage of the Monklands Replacement Project (MRP) will be the outline business case before construction of the hospital can begin. Gartcosh and Glenmavis were already being considered when Wester Moffat was identified through a public site nominations process run by the health board. Neena Mahal, chairwoman of NHS Lanarkshire, welcomed the decision and hailed the involvement of staff and the public during the selection process. Dr Rory Mackenzie, University Hospital Monklands chief of medical services, said: ""It is a crucial step forward on the road to a new Monklands that will be essential in supporting the ideal model of care for our future healthcare challenges, including the rising elderly population. ""We will use the latest technology to deliver Scotland's first digital hospital and clinicians remain at the heart of the process, ensuring our new, ultra-modern hospital is designed to tackle public health issues such as the current coronavirus pandemic."" MRP director Graeme Reid said: ""We look forward to detailing the significant clinical and economic benefits that the construction of the new hospital will bring to the people of Lanarkshire in our outline business case later this year.

"The Netflix trailer shows Robin Wright, who plays Spacey's screen wife Claire, speaking at Frank's grave. ""I'll tell you this though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. When they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line."" Spacey was dropped from the show following sexual assault allegations, which he denies. The trailer gave no details of how Underwood dies in the show but Netflix has said the final series will focus on Wright's devious character, who became US president at the end of season five after Spacey's character quit the Oval Office. Last year, Spacey was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. Spacey claimed to have no memory of the events but publicly apologised. He has since issued an ""absolute"" denial of the other allegations that later emerged. On Wednesday, it was announced that Spacey will not be prosecuted over an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said the alleged incident was outside California's statute of limitations. Officials confirmed in April that an allegation involving Spacey and an incident with a man in West Hollywood in 1992 was being investigated. Another case concerning an alleged incident in 2016 remains under review. Police in London are investigating six criminal cases against him. The final season of House of Cards will drop on Netflix on 2 November with eight episodes rather than the usual 13. In an interview with Net-A-Porter's digital magazine, Wright said the show came ""very, very close"" to being cancelled after its fifth season, ""because of the climate at that time"". ""The air was thick, you know. Harvey Weinstein... People were [saying], 'We have to shut everything down or otherwise it will look like we are glorifying and honouring this thing that's dirty',"" she said. Wright said the political thriller itself ""is not dirty"" and that she believed it should be finished for the ""people that loved the show"". She said it would not have been fair on all the people who worked on the show if it had been cancelled. Asked if she thinks Spacey deserves a career reprieve, she said: ""I don't know how to comment on that, I really don't... I believe every human being has the ability to reform. ""In that sense, second chances, or whatever you are going to call it - absolutely, I believe in that. It's called growth.""

"By Owain ClarkeBBC Wales health correspondent The four nations of the UK are failing to learn from each other, with the NHS instead used ""to batter each other over the head"". Helen Howson, director of the Bevan Commission, said each nation is missing opportunities to share ideas. These include tackling a surge in care demands from an ageing population. Ms Howson said each nation and its health service had ""a bit of the answer"" but there needed to be a way of sharing the best ideas and approaches. Speaking to BBC Wales, Health Secretary Vaughan Gething conceded that politics did sometimes ""get in the way"" of sensible conversations and that there was ""room for improvement"" The Bevan Commission, named after the architect of the NHS, was founded in 2008 on its 60th anniversary. The health and care think-tank is based at Swansea University. Ms Howson said the NHS had ""tended to be used as a political football and that is to nobody's advantage"". Mr Gething said he welcomed the Home Office changing its mind about visas to allow every nation within the UK to recruit doctors and nurses without an artificial cap. ""It would have been much more helpful if we would have been able to have a conversation between the four governments about what we are all finding to be able to make a sensible decision for the future of the service,"" he said. Mr Gething said sharing of information happened between civil servants and within the medical profession but there could be improvement at the political level. The relative performance of the four health systems in recent years has been the focus of intense political debate. There was a row only last week when Theresa May challenged the spending per head on the health service in England and Wales. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, visiting Tredegar on Sunday, launched an attack on the ""massive inequality in even the wealthiest parts of our country"" while praising the efforts of the Welsh Government in protecting health and social care spending. Prime Minister David Cameron in 2014 described the Welsh NHS's performance as a ""national scandal"" and said Offa's Dyke ""has become the line between life and death"". But influential international analysts the OECD later said ""no consistent picture emerges of one of the United Kingdom's four health system performing better than another"". In fact, one senior OECD official told BBC Wales that the quality across the UK is ""not that good"" and ""fairly mediocre"" with great policies not being translated into great practices. At a Bevan Commission conference in Newport on Tuesday, Jennifer Dickson, chief executive of research charity the Health Foundation said no one system in the UK was superior to the other. But she said the discussions about health systems being shaped by politicians were ""very thin, it's not a very good debate, very heated and irrelevant in many respects"". There was a more meaningful level of discussion about modernisation of hospitals, practices and community services.","Serious problems facing the NHS are not being tackled because politicians too often use it as a ""political football,"" a think-tank has warned."
"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent Or at least to be more articulate and confident in speaking up for themselves. Pupils at School 21, a free school in Newham, were also given some very different perspectives on finding your own voice - from Princess Beatrice. The princess is co-founder of a charity, Big Change, that supports young people with skills outside a traditional academic curriculum. This is not one of the capital's wealthier areas. It is not the stamping ground of yummy mummies. Instead, there is the Mummy Yum chicken and kebab shop on the corner near the school. But Princess Beatrice says the idea of learning such life skills is important for anyone growing up, regardless of their background. And everyone has had their own inner struggle with trying to communicate. ""For me, school was a nightmare, I struggled,"" she said, speaking after a workshop with a class of 11- and 12-year-olds. Dyslexia was her big barrier. ""My earliest memory is trying to read Beatrix Potter and the words were literally jumping off the page,"" she said. And ""exams were terrifying"", despite the support of her teachers. Princess Beatrice said it wasn't until secondary school, when she could take part in events such as public speaking, that she felt able to do well. She said lessons in communication being tried at School 21 were ""not just about learning for a test, it is learning for your life"". ""It is good to be pushed out of your comfort zone,"" she said. Also taking part in the project is Karl Lokko, who as a teenager had been a south London gang leader. He said the day before he had taken his GCSEs, one of his friends had been killed. ""He was murdered by my side,"" he said. But even being able to ""denounce gangsterism"" had meant having to learn a vocabulary and way of communicating he had never acquired growing up. Mr Lokko, who read one of his poems to the pupils, said he had deliberately set about learning 10 new words a day - underlining words he had not understood in books or articles and then looking up their meaning in a dictionary. Another co-founder of the charity taking part in the school project was Holly Branson, daughter of Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson. She said that young people from very different backgrounds all faced their own ""struggles to find themselves"". ""No matter what walk of life, all children face their own pressures, you can't just say that privileged kids don't have issues,"" she said. And lessons could be learned from failure as well as success - a message reinforced by her entrepreneurial father. ""I remember when I was doing my driving test and rang my dad to say I'd passed... and there was disappointment in his voice,"" she said. ""Oh no, really. I just really wanted you to fail at something,"" he had told her. Ed Fidoe, who helped to set up School 21, said schools needed to be able to create more of those experiences, where young people could be ""pushed very hard"" and succeed after overcoming difficulties. The school's head teacher, Peter Hyman, said speaking skills represented a major barrier to disadvantaged young people. Mr Hyman, a former speechwriter for Tony Blair, warned of a ""speaking deficit"", adding the skills of ""oracy"" were at ""the heart of social mobility"". Too often poorer youngsters and their families lacked the confidence to speak up for themselves, he said. Mr Hyman said schools should focus much more attention on helping young people express themselves verbally, not least in terms of improving their job chances. The Big Change charity is raising funds for projects to ""help young people thrive in life, not just exams"". And Mr Hyman links speaking skills to children's sense of wellbeing. There have been many recent concerns about the wellbeing of young people and worries about increasing problems with mental health. Holly Branson links it to the relentless pressures to conform with the artificial world of social media, saying young people needed to be shown the ""online world is not the real world"". Princess Beatrice. said: ""It's a really important thing to tackle. ""We can do something that focuses on the symptoms of stress - but it's better to get to the root causes. ""What is this extra pressure? Why do we have young people leaving school not equipped for life? How are we letting them down? ""We live in a world where everything is moving at such a fast pace. ""You have to find an identity that's true to yourself. ""You really have to find your own voice.""",Pupils might often get told to stop talking in class - but a project in an innovative school in east London has been encouraging them to talk more often.

"Their remains had been identified and exhumed from mass graves, and they were laid to rest in the village of Kocho near Mount Sinjar in Ninevah province. Thousands of men were killed and women and children enslaved and raped when IS overran the Yazidis' homeland. The UN says IS carried out genocide against the community. The 104 were all men who had been killed by IS militants in August 2014, the head of the Yazidi Organisation for Documentation, Khairi Ali Ibrahim, was quoted as saying. A funeral was held for them at the Unknown Soldier memorial in Baghdad on Thursday before they were brought home to Kocho. Each coffin was adorned with a photo of the man who had been lost. ""This is a first step in respecting the remains of these victims and it will be also a step of transitional justice that the other victims, the women, the children, who survived the genocide will be compensated,"" said Yazidi human rights activist Mirza Dinnayi. ""I hope that we can do far more in protecting the Yazidi and to say never again for the future."" Yazidis practise a form of religion which combines elements of ancient Iranian religions with parts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. They were considered heretics by IS, a Sunni jihadist group. There were believed to be an estimated 550,000 Yazidis living in Iraq before IS invaded on 3 August 2014. Some 360,000 Yazidis escaped and found refuge elsewhere.

"Ineos wants to conduct seismic surveys at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire to see if there is potential for fracking. The firm said the charity had blocked any contact for almost a year and it was considering seeking a court order. The National Trust said it opposed any activities leading to the extraction of fossil fuels, so rejected requests. Moves to look for shale gas in the Sherwood Forest area have proved controversial due to environmental concerns over extraction - known as fracking - and expansion of fossil fuel use. Ineos said it already had permission from nearby landowners for the the non-invasive survey and its ability to extract gas would be ""significantly limited"" if it could not get on to Clumber Park. ""If the National Trust refuses to change its position, Ineos will have no choice but to write to the Oil and Gas Authority, asking for permission to seek a court order enforcing its rights to carry out these surveys on National Trust land,"" it said in a statement. The company said government licences gave it a legal obligation to investigate shale gas deposits around the country and criticised the charity's position as ""overtly political"" as shale gas had lower carbon emissions than either oil and gas. A National Trust spokesman said: ""The National Trust is opposed to fracking on its land and will reject any fracking requests or inquiries. ""Consistent with this, we say no to surveying on our land for fracking purposes.""",A petrochemical company is threatening legal action over the National Trust's refusal to allow testing for shale gas on its land.

"The fire at Woodmill High School in Dunfermline has been fought by 15 fire appliances since the alarm was raised at about 17:05 BST on Sunday. There are no reports of injuries but Fife Council said the school would be closed and pupils should stay at home.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has asked people to avoid the area to allow access by the emergency services. Deputy assistant chief officer Stuart Stevens, the incident commander, said: ""We have worked through the night in challenging conditions to contain this fire and prevent further spread within the building. ""Through effective planning, we have now surrounded the fire and we are working to extinguish the flames.

Deputy Brehaut said: ""As long as all departments have an awareness that there's things that they can do to lessen the effects, that's the important thing."" He said while the committee's ideas like more CCTV cameras and alcohol free zones had been adopted, it was still keen for ideas such as a mobile CCTV units and a graffiti wall at the proposed new skate part to be investigated.

"Six nations called the situation ""unacceptable"" and warned it ""decreases the credibility of the vaccination process"". Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia urged the EU to apply pressure on Pfizer-BioNTech. Pfizer said the reduced deliveries were a temporary issue. In a statement on Friday, the drugmaker said shipments were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes designed to boost production. ""Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,"" Pfizer said. The company said its production upgrades would also have a ""short-term impact"" on the delivery of vaccines to the UK. Despite this, the UK government said it still planned to hit its target of vaccinating all priority groups by mid-February - about 15 million people. The vaccine from Pfizer is not the only candidate available in the UK, with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca jab also currently being rolled out. The EU is not wholly reliant on the Pfizer jab either, having approved a vaccine manufactured by US company Moderna for use. Still, the development is expected to slow the pace of vaccination programmes. The German health ministry called Pfizer's announcement surprising and regrettable, noting that it had committed to binding delivery dates until mid-February. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had been assured by Pfizer's chief executive that all orders guaranteed for delivery in the first quarter of the year would arrive. Last week, Ms von der Leyen said Pfizer had agreed to supply the EU with 600 million doses this year, double its initial order. The pledge may do little to soothe European governments battling to subdue a fast-spreading Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK. About a third of the 27 EU governments reported having ""insufficient"" vaccine doses at a meeting this week, Reuters reported, citing a participant. Lithuania said it would now get only half as many Pfizer vaccine doses as promised until mid-February. Belgium said it expected to receive about half the planned doses in January. Canada is also affected, because its vaccine supplies come from a Pfizer factory in Belgium. Norway, which is not an EU member, said on Friday that Pfizer was temporarily reducing the number of vaccine doses delivered to the country as of next week. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement that it could supplement the loss using ""emergency stock"". ""The stock we now have will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead,"" it said. Which other vaccines is the EU buying? As well as Pfizer-BioNTech, the European Commission has reached agreements with five other pharmaceutical companies to purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, once they pass clinical trials: The Commission concluded initial talks with another company, Novavax, for up to 200 million doses. Elsewhere in the world, Turkey said it had vaccinated half a million people in two days with vaccines developed by China's Sinovac Biotech. The figures suggest Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its roll-out than France did in almost three weeks. The French government faced a storm of criticism after it emerged that only 500 people had been vaccinated in the first week of the roll-out, which began in late December. Vaccination efforts have since stepped up, though, with 388,730 people receiving at least one dose so far, according to CovidTracker. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden on Friday unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations against Covid-19 when he takes office on 20 January. Mr Biden said his administration would set up new mass vaccination centres and hire extra health workers to achieve his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office. The incoming president made the announcement as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a stark warning about the spread of a highly transmissible coronavirus variant in the US. India, meanwhile, launched the world's largest vaccination campaign on Saturday. Efforts are under way to inoculate 1.3 billion people against the disease, starting with healthcare and frontline workers. Two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Covaxin - are being used in India.

We have a modern, new building and it is designed to be able to help with that kind of thing,"" he said. 'Looked dramatic' Mr Crofts added students were very calm and lessons continued as normal. ""We had a few parents call but there was no suggestion of stress from students,"" he said. He said by break-time at 10:55, the police had given them the all-clear and pupils were let outside as normal. ""It looked dramatic in the street because of the number of armed officers - you would not have known anything was happening inside,"" he added.

"Hemali Modha made the discovery last year after talking to neighbouring shop-owners on Cotham Hill, Bristol. After she complained, the rates for Amulet Boutique were reduced from £3,955 a year to £334 a year. Ms Modha is due to receive a refund dating back to 1 April 2017 but said she has lost more than £20,000 and is unlikely to get any of that back. 'Really struggling' ""When I think about what I could have done with that money to boost my business... well, it makes me quite angry and deeply disappointed in the system,"" she said. A spokesperson from Bristol City Council said business rates were ""based on the individual circumstances of a commercial property"" and were ""periodically revalued"" by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA). The last evaluation for Ms Modha's business premises was on 1 April 2017. The council said any request to change the rateable value before this date required the business owner to contact the VOA directly to request a review. ""It is not a decision the council can make,"" the spokesperson said. Ms Modha said the system needed to change as the ""High Street is really struggling and retailers face enough challenges as it is without being overcharged by the local councils which are supposed to be supporting us"".",A boutique owner who was overcharged thousands of pounds in business rates for years has closed her shop.
"But Marichka Padalko, a news anchor in Ukraine, faced an unusual problem this week when part of her front tooth fell out. However, like a true professional, she simply put the tooth in her hand and continued. ""Honestly, I thought the incident would go unnoticed,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""But we underestimated the attention of our viewers,"" she added, under a video of her losing the tooth. Ms Padalko revealed that she required a tooth repair around a decade ago after her daughter smashed it accidentally while swinging a metal alarm clock. Despite the network initially not posting the video to YouTube, Ms Padalko said she had been impressed by the amount of support she had received. She added: ""In any situation, keep calm, See you tomorrow morning.""","Live TV can throw up all sorts of potential hurdles - technical glitches, unpredictable guests and knowing that there is no take two."
"The company is extending many of its premium services, including an iPhone and iPod app, to non-paying members. It is also encouraging customers to import their music collection into Spotify, rather than Apple's system. However, analysts have questioned how much impact the service can have, given iTunes' dominance and its close integration with Apple devices. At the heart of the update is an attempt to make Spotify a mobile platform for its 10m members. 9m of those use the free version of the service and until now did not have access to their music libraries via mobile devices such as iPods and mobile phones. The update will allow them to synch all of their MP3 collection, including songs purchased from iTunes, from the desktop to a range of iPods, iPhones and mobiles using the Android operating system. But streaming music, which is at the heart of what Spotify does, will still only be available to those who pay a monthly fee of between £5 and £9.99. Restrictions The move will be widely seen as an attempt to placate fans who were angered by restrictions recently imposed on the service. The limits saw the amount of music that free users can listen to halved. It also reduced the number of times an individual track can be played to to five. Gustav Soderstrom, chief product officer at Spotify, denied that there was any link between the new service and recent restrictions. He said that it was a response to customer demand for a greater tie-up between the music they owned the service they used to create playlists. ""Users are juggling two products at the same time and they said they really wanted to synch their playlists with their iPods and iPhones,"" he said. Ultimately, he agreed, the aim was to make iTunes redundant as a music player. ""We think this is a better experience. If it is not, people will go back to iTunes,"" he added. For this ambitious plan to work Spotify will need to encourage users to download songs from Spotify rather than from iTunes. Spotify has hammered out a deal with record labels which centres around the creation of bespoke playlists. It will now offer bundles of tracks, with prices falling as more are bought. Ten tracks will cost £7.99, 15 tracks £9.99, 40 tracks £25 and 100 tracks £50. Spotify hopes the innovation will breathe new life into its download service, which it admits has ""been a bad experience"" for users. New clothes However, Mark Mulligan, an analyst with Forrester Research, was underwhelmed by the changes. ""They don't sound like great discounts to me. All it is doing is applying album pricing to playlists. You might even be able to do that on iTunes already,"" he said. ""I can see what Spotify is trying to do, it wants to acquire the clothes of the more robust music services by offering ways of buying as well as listening to music and creating an alternative music management platform."" He suggested that Spotify would always lack the clout of Apple. ""iTunes is a very bloated music management service but people use it because it is tied to their devices. Apple offers access to the cloud, it has a billing relationship with users. ""Managing music from Spotify doesn't really do much. People will still have to go back to iTunes to buy new tracks. It is hard to see significant numbers of people using it,"" he said.",Online music service Spotify is turning up the heat on Apple as it aims to create an alternative to iTunes.
"Unless they pay £3 to stop for five minutes outside the terminals, bus and train stations, from June their passengers will have to catch a free shuttle bus from about a mile away. Up to 10 minutes' parking will cost £4. Regular taxi drivers will be offered a discount while pick-up fees remain the same - £4 for up to 30 minutes in the airport's multi-storey car parks. Airport officials claim ""extreme congestion"" has left its terminal forecourts ""broken"". Their research estimates that increased passenger numbers next year could see the ""kiss and fly"" lanes experience 20-40% more cars than they can handle. At peak times, one in five drivers has to do an extra lap of the airport before they can find a drop-off space, even though 84% stay for less than five minutes. The free ""drop-off and ride"" service will be introduced in the long-stay Jet Park 1 in Thorley Lane. This add seven minutes to passengers' journeys to cover the half mile to Terminal 2, and 12 minutes to Terminals 1 and 3, which are more than a mile away. Chief operating officer Tricia Williams said: ""As passenger numbers have grown, we have increasingly experienced major congestion problems on our terminal forecourts, exacerbated by a high percentage of visitors repeatedly re-circulating at peak times. ""The simple fact is our forecourts were not designed to handle the number of vehicles they do today and do not have the capacity to cope with any further growth in the number of people being dropped-off immediately outside our terminals.""","Manchester Airport says it is scrapping its free ""kiss and fly"" drop-off lanes in order to ease traffic congestion."
"A spokesman said Mr Duterte missed four scheduled events on Wednesday because he was ""catching up on sleep"". Mr Duterte and other world leaders are in Singapore attending the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) meeting. The 73-year-old defended his actions, saying: ""What's wrong with my nap?"" Mr Duterte has previously missed events at other international summits as well as in the Philippines. His health has been a constant source of speculation over the year, and he revealed in October that he had had a cancer scare. 'In top physical shape' Spokesman Salvador Panelo said the president had ""worked late and had only less than three hours of sleep"". When asked if he was fully rested, Mr Duterte added that the naps were ""still not good enough, but enough to sustain the endurance for the last days"". Mr Panelo also clarified that Mr Duterte's absence had ""nothing to do with his health"". ""The president's constantly punishing work schedule is proof that he is in top physical shape,"" he said in a statement. Mr Duterte has previously admitted that he is tired and ready to quit, but says he had not found a suitable successor yet. But he wasn't the only official caught napping at this year's Asean meetings. A Washington Post columnist captured a picture of South Korean president Moon Jae-in, in which he appeared to be asleep. Josh Rogin later reported that Mr Moon ""woke up from his nap"" after US Vice-President Mike Pence arrived. Bloomberg reporter Toluse Olorunnipa also reported that Mr Moon had fallen asleep after ""waiting 15 minutes"" for Mr Pence to arrive. Mr Duterte and Mr Moon are attending the annual Asean meeting alongside other world leaders including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The meetings end on 15 November.","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte missed several meetings at a regional summit because he was taking ""power naps"", said the presidential office."
