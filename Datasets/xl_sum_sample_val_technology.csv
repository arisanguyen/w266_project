"The company insists it is still committed to launching the smart glasses as a consumer product, but will stop producing Glass in its present form. Instead it will focus on ""future versions of Glass"" with work carried out by a different division to before. The Explorer programme, which gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (£990) will close. The programme was launched in the United States in 2013. It was then opened up to anyone and was launched in the UK last summer. It had been expected that it would be followed reasonably quickly by a full consumer launch. From next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass. New home The Glass team will also move out of the Google X division which engages in ""blue sky"" research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross. She and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago. He said the project had ""broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike"" and he was excited to be working with the team ""to integrate those learnings into future products"". Google says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of any new version. Restaurant ban The Glass project received the enthusiastic backing of Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. He presided over a spectacular unveiling which saw skydivers jump out of an aircraft wearing Glass and beam what they were seeing to a conference in San Francisco. Early users of Glass were very excited about the product, which enabled them get information in a small screen above their right eye, take photos and videos, and get directions. The technology blogger Robert Scoble said he could not now imagine living a day without the product, and was even photographed wearing it in the shower. But he and others soon tired of Glass, complaining that it was not evolving in the ways that had been promised. There were also concerns about privacy and safety, with some bars and restaurants banning the use of the smart glasses on their premises. Other companies have launched smart glasses and various other forms of wearable technology. But no single product has yet proved the major hit that technology companies are looking for as they seek out the next big thing. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Google has tried to present this announcement as just another step in the evolution of an amazing innovation. But make no mistake - Google Glass is dead, at least in its present form. As I found when I spent a couple of months wearing Glass, it has a number of really useful aspects - in particular the camera. There is however one huge disadvantage - it makes its users look daft, and that meant that it was never going to appeal to a wide audience. But Google will now have to deal with a disgruntled community of Explorers who paid a large sum for a device which they must have believed would eventually evolve into something more useful. The Glass team can at least continue its work out of the spotlight without the pressure of deadlines. Tony Fadell, the former Apple designer Google acquired with his smart thermostat firm Nest, will oversee the future of the product. Both he and the Glass team leader Ivy Ross, who has come from the fashion world, will know that form as well as function will have to be at the centre of any successful piece of wearable technology.",Google is ending sales of its Google Glass eyewear.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter If accepted, it would mean government-proposed rules, allowing those living in remote areas to demand broadband, were unnecessary. BT says it would invest up to £600m and coverage would be universal by 2022. About 1.4 million households currently cannot get speeds above 10Mbps, according to Ofcom. This figure is disputed by a group of MPs who say there are a further 5.3 million who have not chosen to take up faster broadband services, some of whom may also not be able to get 10Mbps speeds. In a recently published report, they called on regulator Ofcom to more clearly distinguish between the take-up and actual availability of fast broadband. The government has proposed a universal service obligation (USO), designed to help remote households get fast broadband more quickly, by granting them the right to request broadband speeds of at least 10Mbps - speeds which the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says would ""meet the typical needs of a family"". That proposal is currently under consultation. BT's alternative proposal would see the company rolling out the necessary infrastructure ""proactively"" rather than waiting for a request. The investment would be recouped through customers' bills. 'Warm welcome' The government will now consider whether to abandon the USO in light of BT's offer. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it would consult on BT's proposal, adding that, if the offer was accepted, it would be legally binding. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ""We warmly welcome BT's offer and now will look at whether this or a regulatory approach works better for homes and businesses. ""Whichever of the two approaches we go with in the end, the driving force behind our decision-making will be making sure we get the best deal for consumers."" But Labour's shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said that the 10Mbps target was low and warned that customers must not be forced to pay more. He said: ""Families and businesses in areas without the minimum speed may see some hope in this announcement, but they will be rightly wary that they will be forced to pay the price in extra or hidden charges. That would not be acceptable and the government must take that into account. ""Businesses will also be concerned that the 10 Mbps minimum broadband speed will be outdated and inadequate before it is even fully delivered. Rather than choose an ambitious broadband speed the government went with the cheapest, which will leave us running to catch up with digital developments for years to come."" The telecoms firm claimed that by using a range of technologies, including fibre and fixed wireless, broadband can reach 99% of the UK by 2020. By 2022 BT suggests less than 1% of customers would receive broadband via satellite, rather than built infrastructure. It added that it was already well on the way to offering fast services around the country, with 95% of premises able to access speeds of 24Mbps or faster by the end of 2017. 'A right to broadband' It estimated that the rollout would cost between £450m and £600m and would largely be delivered by BT's spun-off network firm Openreach. ""Our latest initiative aims to ensure that all UK premises can get faster broadband, even in the hardest to reach parts of the UK,"" said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. There have been criticisms that the UK was falling behind other nations in both the availability and speed of broadband services. The universal service obligation (USO) - which the government planned to roll out in 2020 - would have meant that everyone, regardless of where they live, would have the right to request a broadband connection, and BT would have to provide the infrastructure. It was seen as a way to speed up broadband rollout to remote areas which for years have languished on slower net speeds because providers such as BT and Virgin Media saw no profit in offering services to areas with small populations. BT's announcement comes after figures were released by the British Infrastructure Group of MPs showing the worst areas in the UK for broadband. Telecoms regulator Ofcom forced BT to legally separate its broadband infrastructure division Openreach in March. The move was intended to shake up UK broadband, with the view that an independent Openreach would deliver better customer service and investment in broadband. Since the split, Openreach has pledged to offer super-fast fibre broadband to 10 million homes by 2025, using technology known as fibre to the premises (FTTP) which it had previously said was too expensive for wide rollout. 10 worst constituencies for download speeds Percentage of connections below 10 Mb/s",BT has offered to provide the infrastructure for 99% of premises in the UK to get broadband speeds of at least 10 megabits per second by 2020.
"Robot Boris featured on Russian TV and was apparently able to walk, talk and dance. But soon after its appearance journalists began to question the bot's authenticity. In a picture published afterwards on social media, the neck of a person was clearly visible. The robot is in fact a 250,000 rouble (£2,975) costume called Alyosha the Robot, made by a company called Show Robots. While the organisers of the Proyektoria technology forum - which was aimed at youngsters - had not claimed the robot was real, the TV coverage on Russia-24 suggested it was. Russian website TJournal raised concerns about the robot asking a series of questions: On the website of the firm behind the Alyosha robot costume the product is described as being able to create ""an almost complete illusion that you have a real robot"".",A robot on show at a Russian state-sponsored event has turned out to be a man dressed in a costume.
"The change will mean lots of new words will appear to the right of the dot where people usually expect to see .com, or .net. Run by Icann, which oversees the net's addressing system, the scheme gives organisations that can afford the $185,000 registration fee the chance to run their own domain. No longer will they have to search to see if a .com is available. Instead, big companies such as Microsoft, Coca Cola or Nike could run a domain based on their company name. New territory More than 1,900 domain name applications have been received. As well as business names, applications are in for city-based domains such as .NYC and .Berlin, industry sectors such as .cars and even web slang like .lol. There are known to be some duplicates in the list. For instance, there are at least two applications for .africa and for .eco. However, if only 10% of the total go live next year the number of domains on the net will more than double. ""It's the biggest shake up of the domain name space ever,"" said Lesley Cowley, chief executive of Nominet which oversees the UK's net addresses. Nominet has applied to run the .wales/.cymru domain. It is not the first time that new domains have been added to the net. That has been done twice before in 2000 and 2004, said Ms Cowley. ""However,"" she said, ""not all of those domains have been a resounding success."" Icann may have approved the .museum and .coop domains but few were using those suffixes, she said. Others such as .biz and .info had prospered. ""What's different this time round is that instead of having one new extension every few years we will have hundreds coming out in one year,"" said domain investor and blogger Michael Berkens. Group identity The attraction of gaining control of an entire domain had boosted interest, said Mr Berkens, with lots of groups submitting applications. The potential returns meant some of the bigger groups bidding for domains had won serious backing. A start-up called Donuts Inc claims to have raised about $100m (£65m) to pay the registration fees for the 307 domains it has applied to run and to create the computer infrastructure to run those domains. Sizeable investments have also been won by others such as Directi and Minds and Machines to fund their applications. ""However,"" he said, ""not all of them are great ideas, not all of them will succeed."" Mr Berkens said some registrars of current domains had started to take reservations for names that could be popular when the new domains go live. Even though, he said, there were no guarantees that anyone applying to reserve a domain name, such as cats.lol, would get it. ""It will take quite a bit of education and marketing to make the behavioural change,"" he added. ""People will need help with that learning curve."" What that means, he said, was that .com would remain the domain of choice for some time to come. Ms Cowley from Nominet said that large businesses, like Microsoft, would be able to see the benefit of applying for and running their own domains, the picture was much less clear for smaller firms. ""If you have an established business, are happy with your name and your customers and prospective customers know where to find you, then I would not see a business case for moving,"" she said.",The net will get a lot bigger in 2013. That's when the net's familiar domains will be joined by a slew of novel names.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The robocop, complete with police hat to give it that eerie uncanny valley feel, was shown off outside the world's tallest tower, Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, last June. But since then what has it done? And is Dubai's love affair with robotics any more than just PR for a country desperate to be at the cutting edge of technology? PAL Robotics, the company behind the robot, threw some light on its duties, which seemed more tourist guide than police officer. ""This robot joined the Dubai police to help citizens in an innovative and engaging way, and it is located by now in tourist attractions and shopping malls,"" the company told the BBC. ""The robot can provide useful information in multiple languages thanks to its software, and can also guide people to a requested point of interest. ""Besides, it is a tool for citizens to contact the Dubai Police call centres by using the microphones integrated into the robot, and people can use other police-related services through it, such as paying traffic fines."" The robot is part of a wider move to make the region's police service ""smarter"", which will include many more computer-controlled, unstaffed police stations. The Dubai government wants robot police to make up 25% of the force by 2030. As a member of the Dubai police told the BBC when it was launched: ""These kind of robots can work 24/7. They won't ask you for leave, sick leave or maternity leave. It can work around the clock."" Noel Sharkey, a professor of computer science at Sheffield University has worked with the Dubai government on its integration of bots. He told the BBC: ""These robots were originally planned in Dubai to help the elderly or as tour guides."" He is not convinced by the current policing role. ""I think there was a plan to have an emergency button, which would send your location to the police, and that could be a good application - but people could just make fun of them or knock them over."" There is precedent for this. In July 2017, a security robot used to patrol an office building in Washington was found ""drowned"" in a fountain. While police robots might currently be rudimentary, Prof Sharkey predicts they will become ""more intense"" in coming years, taking on the role of surveillance bots or as machines to sniff out explosives or other dangerous materials on the streets. In China, which is already building what it calls the world's biggest camera surveillance network, robots are now being rolled out at numerous train stations and airports. Standing an impressive 1.6m (5ft 3in) tall, the not-so-cutely named E-Patrol Robot Sheriff ""works"" at Zhengzhou East Railway Station in Henan. The robot is equipped with a series of cameras and has, according to reports, already used its on-board sensors to detect a small fire. It can also recognise faces, which lets it ""track and follow potential criminals or suspicious people"", according to Mashable. Meanwhile, AnBot was deployed at Shenzhen International Airport last year and uses four on-board cameras to carry out security checks. According to Chinese publication the People's Daily, it is also, rather alarmingly, armed with an ""electrically charged riot control tool"". China is leading the drone revolution. And it is here that many see robots playing the biggest urban roles, offering alternative ways to deliver goods and even providing autonomous taxi services. Dubai has trialled unmanned taxi drones and plans to roll out a hybrid hover-bike that would allow the police to reach emergencies more quickly. Prof Sharkey is not convinced by the sky-high robot revolution. ""The skies over Dubai could become uncomfortably crowded very quickly,"" he said. ""The ground level of the city could become a dark place of intrigue and mystery like Blade Runner."" But Prof Sharkey believes the rise of the city robot is inevitable. ""I can see lots of roles for robots in cities,"" he said. ""They will be cleaning, inspecting buildings and delivering things. ""But right now they are expensive and they break a lot."" Some believe that within a decade the skies above cities could be full of flying robots, not just delivering parcels but also helping maintain urban infrastructure. Research fellow Bilal Kaddouh is part of a team at the University of Leeds designing a fleet of drones that can repair potholes in roads. ""We have a fleet of three drones; one conducts inspections of the roads, another digs and prepares the road, and a third, with a 3D printer on board, can repair it,"" he said. The team expects to have a working prototype of the system ready this year. Dr Kaddouh hopes one day autonomous drones will be widely used in the construction industry, able to report more exactly what the problems it finds are rather than just ""sending back a flood of data"" as they currently do. He envisages a time when cities will be full of drones maintaining infrastructure. ""Imagine a drone that can land on a high structure and with a robotic arm repair it or change a bulb in a lamppost or install a new communications unit in a communication tower."" Such robots would eliminate the need for workers to put themselves at risk, as well as helping to make a city run more efficiently, he said, but there were barriers. ""People don't like drones buzzing about day and night, and it is also hard to integrate drones into existing airspace. ""The technology is there, but it is now a question of whether regulation and public perception can change.""",It is a terrifying vision of the future - a robot police officer with dark eyes and no discernible mouth that can identify criminals and collect evidence.
"By Shiroma Silva & Talia FrancoBBC Click Smart speakers, tracking apps and key-logging software are among products that have made it easier for perpetrators to maintain control of victims and continue abuse. Domestic-violence charity Refuge says more than 70% of those it provides support to have reported tech-related abuse within a relationship. Two people who experienced abuse during the pandemic shared their stories with BBC Click. They asked to remain anonymous for their own safety. ""When he left the house, that's when I started to see that he was using the Ring doorbell camera to track me,"" says Kate, who is using a pseudonym. She is referring to Amazon's internet-connected security device. It triggers alerts when it detects motion in front of a home and allows live footage or recordings to be watched from afar. ""I could take the battery out of it if I wanted to, but I didn't feel like I could because he would say to me, 'You're compromising our children's safety'. ""I was worried that he would go to the police and try and suggest that I'm a bad mother."" Another explained how her partner used Amazon's virtual assistant to monitor her via a function that lets users remotely connect to enabled smart speakers and listen/speak via an intercom-like facility. ""He would set up all the accounts,"" says Sue, who is also using an alias. ""He would set up family-sharing on things. There were various Alexa devices all over the property. ""He could drop in from outside or he could go to someone's house and ring the Alexa when we were at home."" Abuse experienced by men also increased during the pandemic. The Respect Men's Advice Line reports receiving 5,000 more calls during the start of the UK lockdown than in the same period the year before. But women are still more likely to experience violence and harassment. Three-quarters of domestic abuse victims recorded by the police last year were female, according to the Office for National Statistics' latest figures. 'In control' Dr Leonie Tanzer says she frequently comes across this issue of control in a study of gender and internet-of-things devices she is leading at University College London. ""The perpetrator, who very often tends to be male, is the person that purchases the device [and] maintains the device,"" she explains. ""That gives that person a lot of control over both the environment they're in but also the device admin settings."" Both Sue and Kate's experiences confirm this view. 'We are all in this bubble in the house,"" says Sue. ""Even when I leave, he can see my location through my [smart]watch, or my phone or my iPad or anything. ""I just realised how little control I had over mine and the kids' life and how much he had. I had to get out."" She says her partner locked her our of their shared Amazon account which had her credit-card details attached to it, giving him the ability to spend money she would then be obligated to cover - in effect a means of control. ""I rang up Amazon and I said I can't take my cards off this account,"" she recalls. ""They said, 'Sorry, you just have to cancel your bank cards'. ""The companies should know what the products could be used for."" Domestic abuse law A landmark domestic abuse bill aims to make it illegal to use modern technology to track or spy on partners or ex-partners. The legislation, which covers England and Wales, includes a statutory definition of domestic abuse that recognises coercive or controlling behaviour involving smart technologies. It gives police extra powers to respond to domestic abuse cases involving tech. The law is expected to get Royal Assent in the next couple of months. As with many areas of life, technology can also be used to offer solutions and help, to targets of abuse. But Refuge warns that some of the apps on offer pose further risk of harm. ""We have seen many agencies develop apps for the sole purpose of protecting and offering support to victims of domestic abuse, but often these apps have clear failings and can in fact compromise victims' safety, [for instance] features that disclose the victim's location,"" says the charity. Many people are spending more time than ever at home as a result of the coronavirus, and that means more sharing of software and services. So now, more than ever, Kate suggests, their developers need to think through what happens when relationships break up. 'When you're in a couple, that account is going to be registered to one email address,"" she says, ""When something goes wrong, the person who is unable to use it can't do anything about it. You can't rectify anything or change the details."" Burden of safety A team of security experts at IBM has considered how to minimise the risks of tech enabling domestic abuse. It has devised a set of design principles to guide other device- and software-makers. It believes the onus is too often on targets of abuse having to educate themselves rather than product-makers having to think through the consequences of their creations. ""We believe the burden of safety shouldn't be on the shoulders of the end-user, and we felt it was important to shift at least some of that onus on to thoughtful designs,"" IBM's Lesley Nuttall tells BBC Click, She says home devices, for example, could show alerts when they're remotely activated and have a manual override. ""A lot of the smart devices are designed on the premise that all persons in the home are happy to share information with one another, but this happy scenario doesn't recognise that there are many variations in family life,"" she explains. Family apps are used by many to monitor kids' safety. But by design they share a lot of information and can be misused in an abusive relationship. ""They share other pieces of information, such as battery level, which seems like a small innocuous piece of data,"" Ms Nuttall says. ""But in the hands of an abuser, the victim can't escape that barrage of abuse by simply switching off their phone, saying the battery has died."" IBM also warns that perpetrators often send abusive messages via the reference descriptions given to low-value online bank transfers or gift notes added to internet shopping purchases. ""[There could be] intelligent monitoring of those free text fields to block abusive messages,"" says Ms Nuttall. ""Banking transactions particularly can automatically flag ongoing patterns of small transactions for further investigation."" She added that one bank in Australia was ""horrified by the scale and the nature"" of what it found when it looked into the issue, and has since taken action.

"The Labour MP resigned from the Women and Equalities Committee after misogynistic remarks and degrading jokes he posted more than 10 years ago resurfaced. The scandal raises the question: what steps can you take to avoid old online posts - that may no longer reflect your point of view - coming back to haunt you? But first a warning! Trying to hide your online history could draw more attention to it, than just leaving it alone - and an attempted cover-up could be a bigger scandal than the original posts. Search for yourself A good place to start is typing your name into a search engine and seeing what comes back. You may need to do a deep dive, several pages into the results to find old material you had forgotten was online. The easiest way to remove embarrassing posts from the past is to log in to the website you posted them on, and delete them at the source if possible. Revisit old haunts Check old message boards you used to frequent to make sure you did not leave any regrettable posts online. Your username may not have been your real name, but people may still associate it with you. Message boards often let you search for all the posts made by your account, allowing you to remove or edit anything you no longer want online. You could also run a web search on your old message board usernames to check you have not missed anything. Delete old social accounts Remember Myspace? Former Faceparty fan? Gone from Gaydar? The three networks - and several others - suffered a great exodus when newer social websites arrived. But did you deactivate your old account, or leave it to fester unattended? Old social network profiles can be a treasure trove of embarrassing photos and regrettable stories. It might be time to log in and erase any profiles you no longer use. Change your name Many comments sections on news websites are powered by bigger social networks such as Facebook and Disqus. If you had used your real name on these sites, you could change your name and photo on the associated accounts so that old embarrassing posts are instead attributed to a pseudonym. However, this does breach the terms and conditions of some social networks. Exercise your ""right to be forgotten"" EU citizens can ask search engines to remove results connected to their name, if they are judged to be irrelevant or outdated. This means news stories, old social media posts and blogs can be hidden from search results, making them less likely to resurface. Controversially, the right to be forgotten has been used by criminals and people involved in public scandals to hide news reports featuring their name, on the grounds that they are ""outdated"". Critics say people are able to censor search results in this way. But the EU ruling stands, and so Google, Bing and other search engines let citizens request the removal of certain results. As the ruling only applies to the EU, the ""hidden"" results may still appear for people using the search engine outside the EU. Wait for new laws in May The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will give people more control over the data they have shared online. Under the new rules, people will have the right to order websites and social networks to delete embarrassing old posts. However, in some cases the websites will be allowed to reject the requests - for example, if a post was of scientific or historical importance. Despite Brexit, the UK is adopting the GDPR in its own Data Protection Bill. It will come into force in May 2018. Demand deletion Some social networks make it difficult for you to permanently delete your account, encouraging you to temporarily deactivate it instead. Facebook does provide a page where you can request a permanent account deletion, while Twitter's standard deactivation procedure deletes an account after 30 days. Deleting an account on Facebook and Twitter makes public posts disappear - but copies may still appear in search engine results. Protect your accounts Often the material shared in private messages is more sensitive than what we post publicly. It is always a good idea to protect online accounts with a strong, unique password. If a website offers it, enable two-factor or two-step verification, which makes it harder for anybody to get into your account without permission, because they need both your password and your mobile phone. One final word of advice... Nothing you share on the internet is truly private, and once something is out there on the worldwide web, it can be very difficult to cover it up again. Several sites scrape social networks such as Twitter and Facebook and archive the posts they find - while the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine does a similar thing for websites including message boards and blogs. So to be safe, try not to post embarrassing content online in the first place.",Jared O'Mara is not the first person to have old comments he posted online come back to haunt him.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others. The update had been timed to coincide with the relaxation of lockdown rules. But the two firms had explicitly banned such a function from the start. Under the terms that all health authorities signed up to in order to use Apple and Google's privacy-centric contact-tracing tech, they had to agree not to collect any location data via the software. As a result, Apple and Google refused to make the update available for download from their app stores last week, and have instead kept the old version live. When questioned, the Department of Health declined to discuss how this misstep had occurred. Scotland has avoided this pitfall because it released a separate product - Check In Scotland - to share venue histories, rather than trying to build the functionality into its Protect Scotland contact-tracing app. Virus hotspots NHS Covid-19's users have long been able to scan a QR code when entering a shop, restaurant or other venue to log within the app the fact that they had visited. But this data has never been accessible to others. Instead, it has only come into use if local authorities have identified a location as being a virus hotspot by other means, and flagged the fact to a central database. Since each phone regularly checks the database for a match, it can alert the owner if they need to take action as a consequence, without sharing the information with others. However, this facility has rarely been used, in part because prior to the most recent lockdown, many local authorities were confused about what they were supposed to do. Before shops reopened in England and Wales on Monday, along with outdoor hospitality venues in England, the intention had been to automate the process. This would have involved users who had tested positive being asked if they were willing to upload their logs. Depending on the thresholds set - for example, how many infected users registered having visited the same place on the same day - other app users would then have been told to either monitor their symptoms or immediately get a test, whether they felt ill or not. The Department of Health had described this as being a ""privacy-protecting"" approach. But despite being opt-in, it was still a clear breach of the terms that health chiefs had agreed to when they switched to adopting Apple and Google's contact tracing API (application programming interface) in June 2020. This was after their original effort was found to miss too many potential cases of contagion. Setting a precedent The tech firms' Exposure Notifications System FAQ states that apps involved must ""not share location data from the user's device with the public health authority, Apple, or Google"". And a separate document covering the terms and conditions in more detail says that ""a contact tracing app may not use location-based APIs... and may not collect any device information to identify the precise location of users"". Had Apple and Google made an exception for England and Wales in this case, it could have set a precedent for other countries to have sought changes of their own. The team behind the app was told not to disclose why the update had failed to be released on schedule. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told the BBC: ""The deployment of the functionality of the NHS Covid-19 app to enable users to upload their venue history has been delayed. ""This does not impact the functionality of the app and we remain in discussions with our partners to provide beneficial updates to the app which protect the public."" A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said it had nothing to add. Apple has indicated it wants to work out a solution. Just a week ago, the Department of Health seemed to think this update to the app would go through without problems. It's hard to understand why. After all, the rules for using the Apple-Google Exposure Notification System were clear - collecting any location data was a no-no. The app team knew that when they switched to it last summer, having discovered that going it alone with their own system was just not practical. But they may have assumed that, because the sharing of locations by users was optional, the tech giants might show some flexibility. Instead, Apple and Google have insisted that rules are rules. What this underlines is that governments around the world have been forced to frame part of their response to the global pandemic according to rules set down by giant unelected corporations. At a time when the power of the tech giants is under the microscope as never before, that will leave many people feeling uncomfortable.",An update to England and Wales's contact tracing app has been blocked for breaking the terms of an agreement made with Apple and Google.
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Firstly, there's an Anniversary Update on the way. With that, some enhancements to Cortana and the web browser, Edge - as well as an attempt to reinvent the stylus. Secondly, there's only one month left before the Windows 10 free upgrade offer ends. After that date, it will cost $119 (£89). In a phone call with the BBC, head of Windows Yusuf Mehdi said more than 350 million devices were now being powered by Windows 10. It has undoubtedly been a strong first year. Aside from the backlash from some users who felt Windows 10 was being forced upon them, the operating system is generally regarded as a welcome return to form for the company that still powers the vast majority of the world's desktop and laptop computers. ""Customer satisfaction is at an all time high,"" Mr Mehdi told me. ""We've had over 135 billion hours of usage since the launch."" He'll be hoping to convince many more users to take advantage of the free update before the deadline hits. The lofty goal, set out by Microsoft 12 months ago, is to achieve more than a billion devices running Windows 10 within the next two years. Satya's gamble When Windows 10 was launched, the big news was that it would be made available as a free upgrade for Windows 7 or 8 users, on any device with hardware capable of running it. At a time when Microsoft was well and truly left behind by the smartphone boom, the Windows 10 strategy, put into action by the then-new chief executive Satya Nadella, was certainly a bold move. A year on, we're starting to be able to look at whether Mr Nadella made the right call. ""Despite progress towards the one billion goal, Microsoft faces the reality that consumer engagement is far greater on mobile than PC or tablet and this continues to be a significant disadvantage,"" said Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight. Mr Blaber suggests Microsoft is already well down a path that has it placed as a company now almost entirely focused on businesses rather than general consumers. ""Over 300 million devices is solid progress for Windows 10 and Microsoft has successfully turned the tide of public opinion in the wake of Windows 8,"" he said. ""Nonetheless, Microsoft's future is moving towards a far greater focus on enterprise than consumer. ""Microsoft is successfully transforming Windows into a service and creating the platform for a future that's likely to be more about enterprise services, cloud and artificial intelligence than consumer computing."" When I interviewed Mr Nadella last year, I put it to him that people had historically only used Windows begrudgingly. It was the operating system at school, at work, and on the only computer you could afford. It was the only comment that had the usually ice-cool Mr Nadella a little riled. With Windows 10, he insisted, people would come to not just need Windows, but want it. Perhaps even love it. The usage statistics show Microsoft has done well in getting people on Windows 10. But to what end? The company is still well behind when it comes to powering devices that live in our pockets, rather than on our desks. Tempting updates The Anniversary Update, which will be released on 2 August, includes a hefty number of new features. As has been a big trend across the tech industry this entire year, Microsoft's voice-activated assistant Cortana is becoming an even more integral part of the operating system. On Windows 10-powered devices, Cortana will soon sit above the lock screen. That means you won't have to sign in to your device in order to interact with Cortana. It's a nice time saver - although the idea is already in place on Android and iOS. Also in the time-saving pile is Windows Ink. The company has shared some info on Windows Ink already, but the Anniversary Update will be when it makes its full public debut. ""In this release you're going to see the pen become a first-class method of input,"" promised Mr Mehdi, explaining how the pen - a stylus, in other words - could now be used to scribble notes quickly on to the screen. Like Cortana, much of Windows Ink's appeal will be that you don't need to unlock the device in order to use it. You just click the pen and begin writing on the screen. Also in the update: more uses for Windows Hello. For a while, Hello has been able to log you into a Windows 10 device just by recognising your face (or fingerprint). Now Microsoft hopes to expand that capability to websites. Mr Mehdi envisions a time when you can sign in to your favourite websites using your face rather than a password - an obvious improvement at a time when security experts are questioning the long-term suitability of passwords. The function works within the Edge browser. Web developers only have to add a small amount of code, Mr Mehdi says, in order to enable Hello log-ins on their site. Don't expect many of them just yet, mind. Microsoft couldn't give me any examples of websites that were planning to incorporate log-ins via Hello. The company pointed out that Windows 10 apps made by iHeartRadio and Dropbox already supported the function - though that had been the case for months, and did not include those firms' websites. A long way to go on that idea, then. You could say this example alone underlines Microsoft's challenge at the moment. It isn't having any trouble coming up with new and interesting ideas. But where Microsoft's Windows team still appears to struggle is in getting others - be they users or developers - to be as excited about Windows 10 as they are. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter and on Facebook",It's almost a year since Microsoft launched Windows 10 - which means two things.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The network will initially be available in five cities - Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds and London. The firm is targeting key locations such as stations, shopping centres and stadiums, including Twickenham and Arsenal's Emirates ground. It plans to offer 5G at the same price as 4G, although this will exclude the monthly handset cost. Slough, the town where O2 is headquartered, will be the first non-city to benefit from its 5G, with 14 other towns and cities to follow this year. Mark Evans, chief executive of Telefónica UK, which owns O2, said: ""We're launching with a range of tariffs that make it easy and fair for customers to access 5G, with flexible plans that cost no more than 4G. We're also switching on 5G in important parts of towns and cities first, places where it will benefit customers and businesses most."" O2 offers four 5G-enabled phones, three from Samsung and one from Xiaomi. Business case Vodafone and EE have already launched their 5G networks, and last week BT Mobile also put its service live, piggy-backing off EE's network, which it owns. Three has launched a limited service in London, targeting homes. Paolo Pescatore, a mobile analyst at PP Foresight, said he doubted the fact that O2 was the last to launch would have a detrimental effect. But, he added, all the operators face a challenge. ""All providers have now launched 5G, but the key will be who can make money. This is where the opportunity resides to differentiate, and operators will need to focus on enterprises. ""This will help O2 stand out as it has been working closely with numerous companies."" These include ITN, Samsung and Northumbrian Water Group, and, according to O2, will ""demonstrate real-world 5G use cases"". Next year, when the new iPhone is launched with 5G support, will be a key year for the technology, Mr Pescatore added. While 5G is currently available in dozens of cities in the UK, coverage remains limited for the time being. BT offers a 5G checker for people to see if it is available in their area.","O2 has switched on its 5G network, the last of the UK's mobile operators to do so."
"Rara.com, which has launched in 16 countries, said its research suggested that 60% of consumers had never used a digital music service. The organisation aims to simplify the process. For a monthly subscription, users can select and listen to tracks via their standard web browser. Its main competitor is Spotify, which has more than two million paying users. In addition to the UK, Rara.com is available across much of Europe and the US. It will expand to seven further countries, including Canada and Mexico, by the end of the week. After an initial trial price of 99p a month for the first three months, users can pay for either a £4.99 subscription allowing web-only listening, or £9.99 to enable mobile listening on a smart phone. However, unlike some of its rivals, Rara.com will not offer a free advertising-supported option. 'Simple goal' The site's chairman, Rob Lewis, said his service was not looking to challenge already popular services like Spotify and iTunes but was instead aiming for a relatively untapped market of non-digitally savvy music fans. A survey of 1,000 adults carried out for the organisation found that 70% of respondents had not bought a digital music track over the previous six months. ""Unlike the CD, seven years after the formation of iTunes the vast majority of consumers are not adopting digital,"" Mr Lewis told the BBC. ""The simple goal behind this service is not to compete with all the existing digital players, but to roll out to all the major territories in the world a digital music service that's designed for the mass market of people who are either not technically literate, or like music but don't know a huge amount about it."" Mr Lewis said Rara.com's interface was designed not to feel like ""a spreadsheet"". Playlists will be highly curated by guest editors on the site, the first of which will be Grammy award-winning Imogen Heap. The mobile application, offered on both Android and iPhone, runs using ""networked aware mobile streaming"" - a process which means any played track is automatically stored on the device to allow offline listening. Mr Lewis said due to the service not having a free option, artists should receive more money per play than on other rival offerings. Crowded house The streaming music market is becoming increasingly crowded with services such as Grooveshark, Rhapsody and Rdio all offering similar products. Earlier this month,Spotify announced it is opening up its service to third-party developerswho have been invited to build applications utilising the music library. Will Findlater, editor of Stuff Magazine, believes it will be hard to topple Spotify from its position of market leader, but there is a potentially huge user base waiting to be tapped. ""Although the likes of Spotify allow you to choose to cache music on your computer - Rara is for people who don't know what caching means. I'm not sure if that in itself is enough of a good sell - but the trial price is pittance. ""Other companies will benefit from the fact Spotify has already shown what this kind of service can do. People are telling other people how brilliant music streaming services are.""",A new song-streaming service is targeting music lovers who do not currently pay for digital tracks.
"The suicide attack on Sunday in a Lahore park killed more than 70 people, including children. Facebook's Safety Check system activates after a tragedy to help people let others know they are safe. The social network blamed a ""bug"" for the warnings sent to people thousands of miles away from Pakistan. Responsibility for the attack on Sunday has been claimed by a Taliban splinter group called Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which said it targeted Christians celebrating Easter. Police are still looking in to the claim. Mistaken message The Safety Check system is supposed to be a quick way for members of the social network to let friends and family know they are safe if they are caught up in or are close to a natural disaster or attack. On this occasion, many were made anxious when they received a message because it simply asked ""Are you affected by the explosion?"" without giving information about how close that person was to any potential threat. People in the US, India, UK, Hawaii and many other places wrongly received warnings. Many shared images of the messages on social networks. ""Unfortunately, many people not affected by the crisis received a notification asking if they were okay,"" said Facebook in a statement. ""This kind of bug is counter to our intent,"" it added. ""We worked quickly to resolve the issue and we apologise to anyone who mistakenly received the notification."" The problem is the latest in a series that the Safety Check feature has suffered. Last year, Facebook began to use the system more widely after being criticised about when it was employed. Criticism was levelled at it because it was used for the large-scale attacks in Paris but not subsequently for similar-style bombings in Beirut. Safety Check was originally developed for use after natural disasters but was expanded to include terror attacks after Paris.",Facebook has apologised after its Safety Check system wrongly asked people if they were caught in a bomb attack in Pakistan.
"The researcher, called Zemnmez, found two separate flaws on HMRC's online tax service. He said finding who to report the issues to was more challenging than finding the bugs. HMRC said it had addressed the problems and was looking at improving ways for people to get in touch. Zemnmez said exploiting either flaw could have let attackers view or modify tax records or harvest key details from Britons. ""I spent days reaching out to half a dozen different government social media accounts attempting to find where the right place to go was and got nothing meaningful in response,"" he told the BBC. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre - contacted through friends with intelligence connections - was key in helping get the security problems solved, he added. Common weakness Clues that the HMRC site was vulnerable to attack were picked up by Zemnmez as he was using the site to check his taxes. His expertise and experience in finding similar bugs on other websites suggested that the way the HMRC log-in system interacted with his browser left it vulnerable to some well-known attacks. After a short period of experimentation, he found that it was possible to use the HMRC site as a ""forwarding service"" and send a victim to any site an attacker wanted. ""This could be used to coax the victim into revealing financial information, credentials and usernames and passwords,"" he said. This type of bug is known as an open redirect vulnerability and is a common weakness found on lots of different sites, he added. The second security issue took longer to uncover, said Zemnmez, but was potentially more damaging as, if exploited, it could give an attacker control over a victim's information, potentially letting them modify it. Ironically, he said, the code vulnerable to this serious bug was found in a website script used to digitally fingerprint users for fraud protection. Exploiting this bug would have been much trickier for cyber-thieves, he said, adding that it was likely that anyone interested in attacking the HMRC site would use more straightforward methods to get people to hand over information. 'Very frustrating' In response, an HMRC spokesman said: ""HMRC has addressed the vulnerabilities mentioned in this article and we undertake regular testing of our systems."" He added: ""HMRC takes the protection of customer data very seriously and invests heavily to secure our services."" Zemnmez said that although finding the security issues was straightforward, tracking down people in government that could help fix them proved to be ""very frustrating"". While trying to report the issues he found, Zemnmez discovered that the UK government does run a ""responsible disclosure"" programme that seeks reports of problems with government sites and services. However, he said, the fact that it was invitation-only limited its usefulness. ""I understand the significant difficulties involved in these programmes,"" he told the BBC. ""If a programme were opened to the public to disclose issues without very significant and robust preparation, it would quickly become totally overwhelmed by the volume of reports, both valid and invalid."" Despite this, he said, there should be a way for government to handle reports from seasoned security experts who let them know about problems with the most sensitive official systems. The HMRC said it was in close contact with the NCSC about the way it handled security. It said: ""HMRC is working with the NCSC to ensure that there is a single route for reporting security vulnerabilities to government. ""HMRC is also working to ensure that our internal processes are better streamlined to ensure that those reporting vulnerabilities are contacted in good time.""","The UK tax office must improve its handling of website security problems, says an expert who spent 57 days trying to report a bug."
"And it's not just gamers who are benefiting from the immersive possibilities it offers. Four experts, including Mark Bolas - former tutor of Palmer Luckey, who recently hand-delivered the first VR handset made by his company Oculus Rift - talked to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the future of VR. Mark Bolas: Out of the lab Mark Bolas is a professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts and a researcher at the Institute for Creative Technologies. He has been working in virtual reality since 1988. VR hits on so many levels. It's a real out-of-body experience, and yet completely grounded in your body. People have always wanted to master their environment, to extend our agency. We want our hands to be able to do more; that's why we have hammers. VR allows us to go beyond the limitations of physical tools to do anything that can be computed. If you want to create a two-mile high tower made out of toothpicks, you can do it. I did a series of 14 different environments; one where you felt like you were very high and had to look down: that was the first time people found this sense of vertigo within a virtual environment. I did a world where you look up towards the sky and see fireworks exploding; that's just magical. I wanted to build a tool so people could use it. The best way to do that was to stay away from the consumer market because it really wasn't ready, and to go after industrial uses. So my company created a viewing system that actually meets the specs of modern VR. Because it had such high resolution, commercial users could use it to solve real problems. Automobile companies used it for car design. Oil and gas industry used it to visualise data to figure out the right place to sink a well. The next step was to make these cheap. Consumer VR up until then had a really narrow field of view; it was like looking through a tube of paper. Peripheral vision is really important for a visceral sense, and that's what people really react to. To find a way to make it low cost and still retain that field of view, we harnessed the power of mobile phones - the screens, tracking and processing - and we figured out a lens design that was extremely inexpensive. It's been really fun playing all these years, but there's something more important now, which is making it a space that allows us to harness our emotions, our desire to connect with people. I'm worried by our current computer interfaces. I watch people walking around like zombies with cell phones in their hands, and I have to manoeuvre a mouse to fill out little boxes on web forms in a horribly frustrating way. I think VR will allow us to transcend this. I don't worry so much about where VR is going, I worry about where we currently are. Maria Korolov: Work, rest and play Maria Korolov is a technology journalist who has devoted her career to writing about virtual reality. The biggest way [VR is changing the workplace] is training and simulations. If you have to train somebody on a very expensive piece of machinery, you want to do it in a simulator. The Army, for example, has been an extremely early adopter, as has the air force. One recent example was a doctor [who] practised surgery on a tiny baby's heart. He took scans of the heart, uploaded them to the computer and toured it with this little virtual reality headset, was able to plan out his surgery ahead of time, and saved the baby. In education, the biggest change has been Google Expeditions. Google has been seeding elementary schools with over 100,000 virtual reality headsets and lesson plans. Kids are able to go on a virtual reality field trip to, say, the surface of the moon. Gamers want something visceral. When you're riding a roller-coaster and you go down a hill, your stomach drops out: even though you know it's not real, your body reacts as if it's there. When I showed a shark simulation to people and they screamed, I laughed because, ""Ha ha, they're not real."" Then I put it on and the shark came at me and I screamed, because it's a physical reaction. The adult industry is jumping into this with everything they've got because it is so compelling. I have sampled it purely from a reviewer perspective, and it felt like you were in a locker room, and you don't know where to look because everyone's naked, and the lights are too bright, and they're interacting with you. This is going to be big. The way the internet has changed the way we communicate information, virtual reality will change the way we communicate experiences. If I wanted to show you what it's like to cook a meal, I could invite you to my virtual apartment and take you through a virtual cooking class. If I wanted to experience a walk in the woods with you, I could take you to my favourite virtual woods. It will make the world even smaller than it is now. It will increase the ability of people to telecommute and work together across national boundaries dramatically. It's definitely going to bring us closer together. Skip Rizzo: On the virtual couch Psychologist Skip Rizzo is director for medical virtual reality at the University of Southern California. He has been using VR since the 1990s when he became frustrated with the tools available to help rehabilitate people with brain injuries. I noticed many of my clients were engaged in video games, and people that were very challenged in maintaining attention and focus in everyday activities could focus on those tasks and actually get better. That was the first light bulb. Could we build virtual environments that represent everyday challenges that would help cognitive rehab? We started off building virtual environments from video imagery that we had of Iraq and Afghanistan, and talked to a lot of veterans. The environments we created involved riding in a Humvee in a mountainous area, or a desert roadway. We put somebody in a simulation that is reminiscent of what they were traumatised in, but at a very gradual level so they can handle it. The clinician can control the time of day, the lighting conditions, the ambient sounds. The therapist tries to mimic what the patient is talking about in their trauma narrative. And eventually by confronting it with therapists, you start to see post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms start to diminish. We've used VR to help people with high-functioning autism be more effective at job interviews. This involves having them practise their interviews with a wide range of interviewers - different age, gender, ethnic background, and different levels of provocativeness. We know that the brain is quite good at suspending disbelief, so even though people know these aren't real people, they relate to them as if they are. This is why VR is so compelling, because whatever is learned in those worlds hopefully will benefit how the person translates their behaviour in the real world. Nick Yee: Vulnerable reality Nick Yee is a social scientist who studies how people behave and interact in virtual worlds and online games. We weren't interested in the technology for the technology's sake; the bigger question was using VR as a new platform to study human psychology. Studies show when we step into virtual bodies, we conform to the expectations of how those bodies appear. When we're in a more attractive body, we leverage stereotypes we have about how attractive people behave. People perceive taller individuals as being more confident, and we adopt those norms when we too are given a slightly taller body in virtual reality. You're more likely to be persuaded by and like a person if you share similar traits, even cues as arbitrary as having the same birthday, the same first name. Our brains are wired with all these heuristics for who we like, how easily we're persuaded. VR is uniquely powerful in terms of its ability to manipulate bodies and faces, and hijack a lot of the soft-wiring of how our brain makes sense of the world. We ran another study where we had a virtual presenter mimic a participant's head movements at a four second delay, while the presenter was giving a persuasive argument, and we found that people are more likely to be persuaded when they are being mimicked. You can imagine running into a computer agent in the virtual world that sort of looks like you, and has a bit of your mannerisms, and you can imagine how much more persuasive that computer agent could be. This ability in VR to use algorithms to make [computer agents] more likeable, or their message more persuasive, that's definitely an interesting potential use of virtual worlds. It absolutely does worry me. We thought about this a lot at the lab. Can people inoculate themselves against these strategies? We were pessimistic. We knew from our own studies that a lot of these manipulations can be subtle to the point of being undetectable, yet still have a measurable impact. It's hard to guard against them.

"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter What ensued was an exhausting race for social media pages to take the footage down, as it was replicated seemingly endlessly and shared widely in the wake of the attack. And through social media, it found its way onto the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. This series of events has, once again, shone a spotlight on how sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit try - and fail - to address far-right extremism on their platforms. As the video continued to spread, other members of the public put up their own posts pleading with people to stop sharing it. One pointed out: ""That is what the terrorist wanted."" What was shared? The video, which shows a first-person view of the killings, has been widely circulated. How have people reacted? While huge numbers of people have been duplicating and sharing the footage online, many others responded with disgust - urging others not only not to share the footage, but not even to watch it. Spreading the video, many said, was what the attacker had wanted people to do. A lot of people were particularly angry at media outlets for publishing the footage. Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy, for example, specifically named two British newspaper websites and accused them of hitting ""a new low in clickbait"". Buzzfeed reporter Mark Di Stefano also wrote that MailOnline had allowed readers to download the attacker's 74-page ""manifesto"" from their news report. The website later removed the document, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"". Daily Mirror editor Lloyd Embley also tweeted that they had removed the footage, and that publishing it was ""not in line with our policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos"". How have social media companies responded? All of the social media firms have sent heartfelt sympathy to the victims of the mass shootings, reiterating that they act quickly to remove inappropriate content. Facebook said: ""New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live-stream commenced and we removed both the shooter's Facebook account and the video. ""We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware. We will continue working directly with New Zealand Police as their response and investigation continues."" And in a tweet, YouTube said ""our hearts are broken"", adding it was ""working vigilantly"" to remove any violent footage. In terms of what they have done historically to combat the threat of far-right extremists, the social media companies' approach has been more chequered. Twitter acted to remove alt-right accounts in December 2017. Previously it has removed and then reinstated the account of Richard Spencer, an American white nationalist who popularised the term ""alternative right"". Facebook, which suspended Mr Spencer's account in April 2018, admitted at the time that it was difficult to distinguish between hate speech and legitimate political speech. This month, YouTube was accused of being either incompetent or irresponsible for its handling of a video promoting the banned Neo-Nazi group, National Action. British MP Yvette Cooper said the video-streaming platform had repeatedly promised to block it, only for it to reappear on the service. What needs to happen next? Dr Ciaran Gillespie, a political scientist from Surrey University, thinks the problem goes far deeper than a video, shocking as that content has been. ""It is not just a question about broadcasting a massacre live. The social media platforms raced to close that down and there is not much they can do about it being shared because of the nature of the platform, but the bigger question is the stuff that goes before it,"" he said. As a political researcher, he uses YouTube ""a lot"" and says that he is often recommended far-right content. ""There is oceans of this content on YouTube and there is no way of estimating how much. YouTube has dealt well with the threat posed by Islamic radicalisation, because this is seen as clearly not legitimate, but the same pressure does not exist to remove far-right content, even though it poses a similar threat. ""There will be more calls for YouTube to stop promoting racist and far-right channels and content."" 'Legitimate controversy' His views are echoed by Dr Bharath Ganesh, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""Taking down the video is obviously the right thing to do, but social media sites have allowed far-right organisations a place for discussion and there has been no consistent or integrated approach to dealing with it. ""There has been a tendency to err on the side of freedom of speech, even when it is obvious that some people are spreading toxic and violent ideologies."" Now social media companies need to ""take the threat posed by these ideologies much more seriously"", he added. ""It may mean creating a special category for right-wing extremism, recognising that it has global reach and global networks."" Neither under-estimate the magnitude of the task, especially as many of the exponents of far-right views are adept at, what Dr Gillespie calls, ""legitimate controversy"". ""People will discuss the threat posed by Islam and acknowledge it is contentious but point out that it is legitimate to discuss,"" he said. These grey areas are going to be extremely difficult for the social media firms to tackle, they say, but after the tragedy unfolding in New Zealand, many believe they must try harder.","A gunman opened fire in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 50 people and injuring 50 more. As he did so, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Players are currently able to buy and sell weapons, armour and other virtual items to each other using either real-world cash or in-game gold. Blizzard took a cut of any transactions involving real-world money, offering it an extra source of income. But it has now acknowledged that the facility ""short-circuited"" the title. It follows complaints from gamers that the auction houses made the game less satisfying to play as they undermined the challenge of the battle to defeat Diablo, the ""lord of terror"". The company said that the auction houses would be removed on 18 March 2014, giving users a chance to adjust. ""We firmly believe that by shutting down the real-money and the gold auction houses, it really paves the way to make sure that killing monsters in-game is the most rewarding, the most satisfying, the most compelling way of getting your hands on those items,"" said Josh Mosqueira, Diablo 3's game director. Although the move may please many, it is has caused controversy with some as it effectively makes their virtual possessions worthless outside the game's horror-themed fantasy environment. ""You might as well be robbing us,"" wrote one user on the company's forums. ""I have accumulated about $100 [£62] on the real-money auction house... if you allowed me to transfer it to Paypal even, that would be something, but you basically just ripped off every successful player on your game."" 'Glacial speed' Although people had long traded other games' items with each other ahead of Diablo 3's launch, these transactions had typically been private affairs arranged outside of a game-world, sometimes in breach of the rules. Blizzard itself had banned players of another game - World of Warcraft - from buying and selling gear outside the title. Diablo 3 marked a change of strategy. UK users, for instance, now faced a £1 fee for each item sold in the real-money auctions and 15% charge of the final sale price for in-game commodities including ""gold"", which itself could be used to make purchases. Bearing in mind Diablo 3 proved to be the fastest ever selling PC game in the weeks after its launch, it offered a potentially lucrative way for the company to continue making money after players had bought the subscription-free title. ""Blizzard were leading the way with the real-money auction house, designed to take what was being done in a grey economy and making it legitimate, and indeed profitable,"" John Walker, editor of PC gaming site Rock, Paper, Shotgun told the BBC. ""They just did it in the wrong game. The very purpose of Diablo is to run around killing stuff and having them then drop new weapons and new equipment which allows you to kill more creatures, letting you gather better items - creating a cycle which drives you to carry on. ""There's no doubt that what went wrong was always going to go wrong, and at its glacial speed Blizzard have acknowledged this."" Despite the firm's U-turn another industry watcher said it would not spell the end for real-money auction houses. ""This is not a condemnation of the model itself but rather its implementation,"" said Ed Barton, director of digital media at the consultancy Strategy Analytics. ""Diablo the game itself obviously went through two previous iterations where it didn't have an auction house and was not designed with the assumption that one would exist as a additional revenue stream for the developer. ""For success at charging for this type of transaction between users, that has to be baked into the design from the moment the initial game design document is drawn up.""","Video game Diablo 3 is to ditch its auction houses after its developer acknowledged the facility ""undermines"" gameplay."
"Mr Taylor's lawyer says the suspension of his account is a form of censorship, accusing Twitter of discrimination. Twitter declined to comment on the case but has previously said that its tools are ""apolitical"". Mr Taylor is head of American Renaissance, a website that champions ""racial difference"". He had his account suspended in December, with Twitter explaining that it prohibited accounts affiliated with the promotion of violence, something Mr Taylor denies applied to him. Mr Taylor has filed his case in California, in the state Superior Court in San Francisco. He argued that Twitter violated Californian law protecting free speech in public spaces - a law that has not previously been applied to the internet. His lawyer Noah Peters wrote online that everyone should be ""terrified"" about what he called Twitter censorship. ""Our lawsuit is not about whether Taylor is right or wrong. It's about whether Twitter and other technology companies have the right to ban individuals from using their services based on their perceived viewpoints and affiliations. ""Allowing Twitter to censor content is extremely troublesome given Twitter's self-proclaimed mission to 'give everyone the power to create and share ideas instantly, without barriers'."" Russian bots Social media firms have been under increasing pressure from governments to deal with both fake news and abusive content on their networks. This week, Twitter banned some accounts suspected of being Russian bots. Locked-out users had to provide a telephone number which they then had to verify in order to prove they were real. That purge has also drawn a lot of criticism, with some users raising concerns that the lock-out was aimed at accounts expressing right-wing political beliefs. Similar challenges to Twitter's account closures have been filed before. Conservative activist Charles Johnson has a lawsuit against Twitter pending in California after he was banned in 2015.",White nationalist Jared Taylor is suing Twitter after the social network banned his account as part of a crackdown on abusive content.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Every few days there seems to be a fresh accusation or leak that paints the social network in the worst possible light and calls into question whether it poses a threat to its members, wider society and even democracy itself. The latest barrage came in the form of a tranche of ""confidential"" internal emails published online by MPs, who have been smarting that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg refused to testify before them. As Damian Collins, the chair of the Parliamentary committee responsible, put it, if they could not get ""straight answers"" from Mr Zuckerberg then at least the emails could reveal how his firm treats users' data and protects its ""dominant position"". Mr Collins claimed the documents prove that the social network continued giving some favoured apps access to users' friends' data after a cut-off point that was supposed to protect its members' privacy. He added that the emails showed the firm had also sought to make it difficult for users to know about privacy changes, and had surreptitiously studied smartphone users' habits to identify and tackle rival apps. Overnight on Wednesday, Facebook has published a blow-by-blow response to these and other allegations. The main thrust of its defence is that the emails had been ""cherry-picked"" to paint a ""false"" picture of what really happened. But does its counter-attack stand up? White lists One of the key apparent gotchas from the documents was Facebook's repeated references to ""whitelisting"" - the process under which it grants special access to users and their friends' data to some third parties but not others. The context for this was that in April 2014, Facebook announced that it planned to restrict developers from being able to tap into information about users' friends as part of a policy referred to as ""putting people first"". Until that point, any developer could build products that made use of Facebook users' friends' birthdates, photos, genders, status updates, likes and location check-ins. While such access was to be cut off, Facebook said it would still allow apps to see who was on a user's friends list and their relevant profile pictures. However, if developers wanted this to include friends who were not using the same app, they now needed to make a request and pass a review. New apps needed to apply immediately, and existing ones were given a year's grace. But Mr Collins said the emails demonstrated that some firms ""maintained full access to friends' data"" after the 2015 deadline. The documents certainly show several apps sought extended rights - although it is not always clear what the final outcome was. But Facebook says it only gave ""short-term"" extensions to the wide range of information about friends and did so in cases when apps needed more time to adapt. ""It's common to help partners transition their apps during platform changes to prevent their apps from crashing or causing disruptive experiences for users,"" it explained. In fact, Facebook already gave Congress a list in July of about 60 organisations to whom it granted this privilege, and said at the time that in most cases it was limited to an extra six months, The names excluded some of the bigger brands referenced in the emails, including Netflix, Airbnb and Lyft. The inference is that if they were indeed granted special long-term rights, it was only to access complete lists of friends' names and profile images. But since Facebook does not disclose which developers have these extra rights, it is impossible to know how widely they are offered. Value of friends' data Facebook has long maintained that it has ""never sold people's data"". Rather it said the bulk of its profits come from asking advertisers what kinds of audience they want to target, and then directing their promotions at users who match. But Mr Collins said the emails also demonstrated that Facebook had repeatedly discussed ways to make money from providing access to friends' data. Mark Zuckerberg himself wrote the following in 2012: ""I'm getting more on board with locking down some parts of platform, including friends' data... Without limiting distribution or access to friends who use this app, I don't think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all besides offering payments and ad networks."" Facebook's retort is that it explored many ways to build its business, but ultimately what counts is that it never charged developers for this kind of service. ""We ultimately settled on a model where developers did not need to purchase advertising... and we continued to provide the developer platform for free,"" it said. But another email from Mr Zuckerberg in the haul makes it clear that his reasoning for doing so was a belief that the more apps that developers built, the more information people would share about themselves, which in turn would help Facebook make money. And some users may be worried that it was this profit motive rather than concerns for their privacy that determined the outcome. Android permissions Another standout discovery was the fact that Facebook's team had no illusions that an update to its Android app - which gave Facebook access to users' call and text message records - risked a media backlash. ""This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective,"" wrote one executive, adding that it could lead to articles saying ""Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways"". In the conversation that followed, staff discussed testing a method that would require users to click a button to share the data but avoid them being shown an ""Android permissions dialogue at all"". Mr Collins claims the result was that the firm made it as ""hard as possible"" for users to be aware of the privacy change. Facebook's defence is that the change was still ""opt in"" rather than done by default, and that users benefited from better suggestions about who they could call via its apps. ""This was a discussion about how our decision to launch this opt-in feature would interact with the Android operating system's own permission screens,"" added the firm. ""This was not a discussion about avoiding asking people for permission."" It previously defended its conduct in March after users had spotted saved call logs in archives of their Facebook activity and did not recall giving the social network permission to gather them. Whether you accept its explanation or not, it does not look good that executives were clearly worried that journalists might ""dig into"" what the update was doing in the first place. The risk is that this adds to the impression that while Facebook wants its members to trust it with their information, the firm has an aversion to having its own behaviour scrutinised. Surveying rivals Part of the way through the hundreds of text-heavy pages is a selection of graphs. They show how Facebook tracked the fortunes of social media rivals including WhatsApp - which it went on to buy - and Twitter's viral video service Vine - which it decided to block from accessing some data. This tracking was done via Onavo, an Israeli analytics company that Facebook acquired in 2013 - which provided a free virtual private network app. VPNs are typically installed by users wanting an extra layer of privacy. Mr Collins accused Facebook of carrying out its surveys without customers' knowledge. Its reply was that the app contained a screen that stated that it collected ""information about app usage"" and detailed how it would be used. It is true that the app's privacy policy stated that it might share information with ""affiliates"" including Facebook. But it is questionable how many of its millions of users bothered to read beyond the top-billed promise to ""keep you and your data safe"". In any case, if Facebook is not hiding anything it is curious that, even now, on Google Play the app continues to list its developer as being Onavo rather than its parent company, and only mentions Facebook's role if users click on a ""read more"" link. It is also noteworthy that Apple banned the app earlier this year from its App Store for being too intrusive. Targeting competitors You do not get to be one of the world's biggest companies just by playing nice. So, Mr Collins' accusation that Facebook had taken ""aggressive positions"" against rivals is probably unsurprising. Even so, it is interesting the degree to which Mr Zuckerberg is involved. ""We maintain a small list of strategic competitors that Mark personally reviewed,"" disclosed one memo. ""Apps produced by the companies on this list are subject to a number of restrictions... any usage beyond that specified is not permitted without Mark-level sign-off."" As the case of Vine demonstrated, he is willing to take a tough line. When asked if Facebook should cut off Vine's access to friends' data on the day of its launch in 2013 - ahead of the later wider crackdown - his reply was brief. ""Yup, go for it."" Facebook suggests such behaviour is normal. ""At that time we made the decision to restrict apps built on top of our platform that replicated our core functionality,"" it said in its response. ""These kind of restrictions are common across the tech industry with different platforms having their own variant including YouTube, Twitter, Snap and Apple."" But it added that it now believes the policy is ""out-of-date"" so is removing it. Too late for Vine, which shut in January 2017. And Facebook's problem is that politicians now have another reason for new regulations to limit anti-competitive behaviour by the tech giants. Digital rights campaigners also have new reasons to gripe. ""Time and again, Facebook proves itself untrustworthy and incapable of building the world it claims it wants to see,"" Dr Gus Hosein, from Privacy International, told the BBC. ""They show a pattern, fostered by market dominance, of deceptive and exploitative behaviour, which must be stopped.""",Facebook's staff feel like they are under siege.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Several big names have supposedly been ""outed"" by the press after the release of personal information stolen from the dating website, which is aimed at married people. And generally speaking, there is huge potential for damaging people's reputations. There are questions about how - or whether - Ashley Madison will recover from the incident, which has the potential to be one of the messiest and most legally troublesome data dumps in history. What are people doing with the data? There are already some who have tried to tie names and email addresses in the database to real individuals. One particularly widely reported incident concerns two Australian DJs who, while interviewing a concerned listener live on air, revealed to her that details identifying her husband were present in the database. The woman responded in shock, saying: ""Are you freaking kidding me?"" Shortly afterwards, she hung up. One of the hosts admitted: ""I don't know if we should have done that. That hasn't left me with a good feeling."" It's worth noting that people were able to sign up to Ashley Madison using false names and email address - no email account verification was required. One Scottish National Party (SNP) MP, Michelle Thomson, whose email address was among the millions included in the dump, has said the address was harvested by hackers and that she never contacted the website herself. There are also a number of obviously fake details - including an email address for FBI agent Fox Mulder, a character on TV show, The X-Files. Who else has been linked to the site as a user? One allegation hitting the headlines is that anti-divorce activist and US TV personality Josh Duggar had an account, though he has yet to comment on the claim. Further to this, a wide range of public figures and government employees' names and email addresses have been found in the data, but again it's not clear whether this is indicative of actual use of the site. The list includes names of police officers, government officials, members of the military, diplomats and senior politicians. No such individuals have so far publicly admitted using Ashley Madison. What are the implications of being able to search the data? Several people have created tools to let users search for email addresses in the data, but it's not always clear how these tools are working, how accurate they are, or whether they are recording such search attempts. Microsoft-accredited security expert Troy Hunt has published a tool to allow people to be notified if their email address is part of the dump, but does not allow people to search through it at will. He has also written a Q&A explaining why he believes doing so would be unfair. A breach of privacy may have occurred if personal information has been discovered and published, according to Mark Watts, head of data protection at London law firm Bristows. In such cases the victim may decide to sue the perpetrator. However, searching the data on an individual basis and purely out of curiosity is not likely to be considered illegal. ""Simply looking at it itself as an individual shouldn't be a problem,"" he told the BBC. Did Ashley Madison users take steps to protect themselves from this? Besides using fake names and email addresses, some users had in the past paid Ashley Madison to remove their data. Previously, Ashley Madison's chief executive told Ars Technica that data would be deleted ""permanently"". However, multiple reports have now alleged that data which users paid £15 ($23) to be removed actually remained in the database that has now been made public online. Avid Life Media, which owns Ashley Madison, did not respond directly to a request for comment on the claim. Mr Watts said users might, in theory, be able to make a claim against the company that there had been a breach of contract. But he said such a move would be complicated, costly, and risk further exposure. Would the Data Protection Act aid people here? A question mark exists over whether Ashley Madison was in fact subject to the UK's Data Protection Act. Mr Watts said that for this to be the case, the company would have to have some physical presence, such as an office or server, in the UK. ""If we assume they are somehow subject to [the act], then people have a right to have their data deleted for free. You can't charge for it,"" he said. ""That would potentially be an issue."" What about the legal consequences for married couples? If someone suspected their spouse of adultery or infidelity, finding identifying details within the Ashley Madison details could be grounds for a divorce case, according to Marilyn Stowe, a prominent British divorce lawyer who spoke to the BBC. Evidence that a husband or wife had used the site could be considered ""unreasonable behaviour"" she explained. ""Even if you're not able to prove adultery, which is one basis for an immediate divorce, unreasonable behaviour is another one,"" she said.","Data from the Ashley Madison website breach has flooded on to the web, leaving thousands of people fretting about the potential consequences."
"The Federal Trade Commission had alleged the Atlanta-based firm failed to take reasonable steps to secure its network. The records of at least 147 million people were exposed in the incident. At least $300m will go towards paying for identity theft services and other related expenses run up by the victims. This sum will expand to a maximum of $425m, if required to cover the consumers' losses. The rest of the money will be divided between 50 US states and territories and a penalty paid to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It represents the FTC's largest data-breach settlement to date, topping a $148m penalty Uber agreed to last year. ""Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach,"" said the FTC's chairman Joe Simons. ""This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud."" The agency added that among the stolen information, the hackers copied: The UK's Information Commissioner's Office has already issued the company with a £500,000 fine for failing to protect the personal information of up to 15 million UK citizens during the same attack. Unpatched system Equifax had been warned in March that one of its databases - the Equifax Automated Consumer Interview System (ACIS) - suffered from a critical vulnerability, the FTC said. The ACIS was used by members of the public to check their own credit reports. But because of the way that Equifax's IT systems had evolved, it also provided a means for hackers to access other unrelated records stored by the firm. The FTC alleged that Equifax's security team ordered that the vulnerable systems be patched within 48 hours after being informed of the discovery in March 2017. But the watchdog added that the firm failed to check that this was done, and that as a consequence multiple hackers were able to exploit the flaw and steal consumers' personal details over a period of several months. To make matters worse, it said, much of the sensitive information had been stored unencrypted in plain text. As part of the settlement the FTC said that Equifax had also agreed to:",Credit score agency Equifax has agreed to pay up to $700m (£561m) as part of a settlement with a US regulator following a data breach in 2017.
"The social network said its new policy prohibits ""any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust"". Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wrote that he had ""struggled with the tension"" between free speech and banning such posts, but that ""this is the right balance"". Two years ago, Mr Zuckerberg said that such posts should not automatically be taken down for ""getting it wrong"". ""I'm Jewish and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened,"" he told Recode at the time. ""I find it deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong."" His remarks led to a large public backlash. But on Monday, as Facebook changed its policies, he wrote that he had changed his mind. ""My own thinking has evolved as I've seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech,"" he wrote in a public Facebook post. ""Drawing the right lines between what is and isn't acceptable speech isn't straightforward, but with the current state of the world, I believe this is the right balance."" Earlier this year, Facebook banned hate speech involving harmful stereotypes, including anti-Semitic content. But Holocaust denial had not been banned. Facebook's vice-president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said the company had made the decision alongside ""the well-documented rise in anti-Semitism globally and the alarming level of ignorance about the Holocaust, especially among young people"". She said that later this year, searching for the Holocaust - or its denial - on Facebook would direct users to ""credible"" information. But she also warned change would not happen overnight, and training its employees and automated systems would take time. The World Jewish Congress - which had conferred with Facebook on anti-Semitism - welcomed the move. ""Denying the Holocaust, trivializing it, minimizing it, is a tool used to spread hatred and false conspiracies about Jews and other minorities,"" the group said in a statement. But it also noted that it had campaigned for the removal of Holocaust denial content from the platform ""for several years"". Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted: ""This has been years in the making."" ""Having personally engaged with Facebook on the issue, I can attest the ban on Holocaust Denial is a big deal... glad it finally happened."" This was a bit of a ""wait, they don't do this already?"" moment. Perhaps that's because Facebook has quite radically shifted its position on removing hate speech and fake news in recent months. We're still seeing loopholes from an old moderating regime being closed. Critics, though, argue this isn't happening fast enough. The combined platforms of Facebook and Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - have an extraordinary reach of billions of users worldwide. That influence has to be used responsibly, and Facebook acknowledges this. The advertising boycott in July also helped cement the view internally that more had to be done to tackle hate speech. Mark Zuckerberg's instincts have always been to champion freedom of speech - the best way to fight bad speech is good speech he's always said. But this latest move appears to indicate Facebook now accepts it needs to be more proactive in combating hate speech.",Facebook has explicitly banned Holocaust denial for the first time.
"By Dave Lee and Nick KwekBBC News Speaking exclusively to BBC Click, Prof Kim Heung-Kwang said the country had around 6,000 trained military hackers. The warning follows last year's Sony Pictures hack - an attack attributed to North Korea. Korean technology expert Martyn Williams stressed the threat was only ""theoretical"". Prof Kim has called for international organisations to step in to prevent North Korea launching more severe attacks. Military attack For 20 years Prof Kim taught computer science at Hamheung Computer Technology University, before escaping the country in 2004. While Prof Kim did not teach hacking techniques, his former students have gone on to form North Korea's notorious hacking unit Bureau 121. The bureau, which is widely believed to operate out of China, has been credited for numerous hacks. Many of the attacks are said to have been aimed specifically at South Korean infrastructure, such as power plants and banks. Speaking at a location just outside the South Korean capital, Prof Kim told the BBC he has regular contact with key figures within the country who have intimate knowledge of the military's cyber operation. ""The size of the cyber-attack agency has increased significantly, and now has approximately 6,000 people,"" he said. He estimated that between 10% to 20% of the regime's military budget is being spent on online operations. ""The reason North Korea has been harassing other countries is to demonstrate that North Korea has cyber war capacity,"" he added. ""Their cyber-attacks could have similar impacts as military attacks, killing people and destroying cities."" Stuxnet clone Speaking more specifically, Prof Kim said North Korea was building its own malware based on Stuxnet - a hack attack, widely attributed to the US and Israel, which struck Iranian nuclear centrifuges before being discovered in 2010. ""[A Stuxnet-style attack] designed to destroy a city has been prepared by North Korea and is a feasible threat,"" Prof Kim said. Earlier this year, the South Korean government blamed North Korea for a hack on the country's Hydro and Nuclear Power Plant. ""Although the nuclear plant was not compromised by the attack, if the computer system controlling the nuclear reactor was compromised, the consequences could be unimaginably severe and cause extensive casualties,"" Prof Kim said. Martyn Williams is a journalist who follows closely the development of technology in North Korea. He told the BBC: ""I think it's important to underline that this is theoretical and possible from non-North Korean hackers too. ""It's conceivable that hackers would try something and lives could be at risk. He noted an attack in 2013 on South Korean broadcasters, which he said was ""an attempt to throw the country into confusion"". ""If TV had gone off air and then ATMs stopped working, people might have panicked."" Inside Bureau 121 When it comes to cyber-attacks, few groups are as notorious as North Korea's Bureau 121, which has operated since the late nineties. Most security researchers agree that the group operates out of China. Specifically, in the basement of a restaurant, rated highly on TripAdvisor for its tremendous Korean food. Read More: How fearful should be we of Kim Jong-un's hackers? 'Off the internet' Prof Kim has called on international organisations to take action over North Korea's cyber-activity. ""We need to collect the evidence of North Korea's cyber terrorism and report them to UN Human Rights Council and other UN agencies,"" he told the BBC. ""If North Korea continues to cause damage in this way, an organisation such as Icann should ban North Korea."" Icann - the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers - manages the distribution of domain name including .com and .net. It could, theoretically, shut down the use of North Korea's domain, .kp. In a statement, Icann said its powers in this regard were limited. ""Icann does not have the power, nor remit, to ban countries from having a presence on or access to the Internet,"" said Duncan Burns, its head of communications. ""Icann's primary role is the coordination of the internet's unique identifiers to ensure the stability, security and resiliency of the internet. ""We rely on law enforcement and governmental regulatory agencies to police reported illegal activity."" Furthermore, disabling .kp would have minimal effect if, as is widely believed, much of North Korea's hacking force conducts its operations outside of the country. Other measures, such as sanctions imposed by the US in the wake of the Sony Pictures hack, might have a greater impact. But Prof Kim added: ""This issue can't be solved by one or two countries. ""The international community needs to pay attention to North Korea's attempts to destroy the internet."" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC","North Korean hackers are capable of attacks that could destroy critical infrastructure and even kill people, a high-profile defector has warned."
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News A four-year investigation named Operation Alpine led to the closure of the site and resulted in 132 UK children being identified and safeguarded. In addition, 55 arrests have been made of people who ran and used the site. More arrests are expected. The vast majority of the 200 UK suspects who accessed the illegal images were not previously known to the police. It is a feature that crops up time and again during investigations of sites that peddle child sex abuse images, said Mick Moran, Interpol's co-ordinator on child abuse. ""The vast majority of people being arrested for possession of child sex abuse material are between 25-45, white and taxpayers,"" he said. ""Those people are not normally the ones that come to the police's attention."" Mr Moran believes that is odd because the web's openness and lack of anonymity make it a poor choice for anyone breaking the law. ""From a law enforcement point of view and a sex offender point of view the web is not the ideal source of this material,"" said Mr Moran. Established offenders prefer to get material they covet via more covert sources such as invitation-only discussion forums, peer-to-peer networks and dedicated file transfer sites, he explained. When images of child sex abuse appear on the web there's usually a very obvious motive. ""The web is only used where there is an attempt to monetise this material,"" he said. That view stands in contrast to the other places where established abusers trade content, not for cash, but on a like-for-like exchange basis. Material world In the UK, the Internet Watch Foundation shuts down websites where images of child sex abuse are being shared and offered for sale. In 2010, the IWF's annual report said that it knew of 14,602 sites peddling images. About 59 pages a day were added to that list. Most of the reports about sites hosting the images come from members of the public that stumble across the material, said Emma Lowther, a spokesperson for the IWF. Much of the material found online is simply copied from elsewhere, she explained. ""A lot of the content is recycled,"" she said. ""As soon as an image is put up in one place it can be copied and replicated elsewhere."" The ease with which content can be copied and shared creates its own problems for police forces as they comb through it to identify victims, abusers and networks. Operation Alpine netted more than one million images and 6,000 films. Other operations have produced similarly huge amounts of material. In many cases it is far too much for any individual to look through and categorise, said Pelle Gara from technology firm Net Clean which helps some police forces catalogue what they find. Analysing all the content was important, he said, because the charges brought against defendants depend on the severity of the images and films found. Computers can do the work quickly by reducing images to a digital shorthand. They can compare what has been turned up in a recent raid to older material. The analysis can also aid investigations by teasing out links between sites and offenders. ""The pictures are the constant, not the sites they appear on,"" he said. Letting computers do the analysis also means investigators and officers only have to look at content that has never been seen before. That is good, said Mr Gara, because it reduces the number of images investigators have to look at. The psychological toll of viewing thousands of pictures or videos can be heavy. Community work While more experienced offenders shun the web when seeking images of child sex abuse, evidence is starting to accumulate about the broader effect it has. ""The web has hugely facilitated exposure to this type of material,"" said Mr Moran, particularly for a class of what is known as ""naive"" offenders who are only starting to seek out such content. That may help to explain why highly professional, educated people that were not known before to police are being caught in possession of the material. Law enforcement agencies and psychologists are debating the relationship between the availability of the material online and those who are interested in it. Dr Ethel Quayle, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Edinburgh said that studies have done little to settle the question of what was more important to them - the easy availability of images or a latent sexual attraction to minors. What was clear, she said, was that the web fulfils many of its founding impulses for the communities of offenders that spring up online. ""The internet was always thought of in its early stages as really good learning environment,"" she said, ""and to some extent that's what we also see if we look in some of the chat logs."" ""A large amount of the content is learning from others how not to get caught,"" she said. Dr Quayle also believes that mixing in such a community helps to legitimise an interest in images of child sex abuse. ""Whatever else it does, no matter how large a step you take into that community, there's growing evidence that hanging out with the bad guys means you may do more,"" she said. ""There's evidence to suggest that, but we are still a long way from knowing what that relationship is."" Dr Quayle said that it was unclear whether individuals would have begun offending, without access to the images. But the figures are worrying. Although convictions for sexual offences against children are falling, the proportion of offences that relate to internet crimes against children are going up. ""It's a problem that's simply not going away,"" said Dr Quayle.","In May 2011, Lincolnshire Police announced that it had broken up a web-based news group that sold and distributed images of child sex abuse."
"The disputed innovations include a way to synchronise photos, music and video files across several devices, and a method to capture and send video over the internet. Samsung had already filed claims against earlier iPhones and iPads. It coincides with calls from a judge for ""major reforms"" to US patent law. Judge Richard Posner, who previously oversaw a legal dispute involving Apple and Google's Motorola unit, said that protection available to software patents was ""excessive"". Patent wars Samsung's legal move is the latest in a long running battle with Apple. The US firm has claimed that the Galaxy device maker copied the look and iOS system software found on its tablets and handsets. Although several of Apple's claims have been rejected, it recently scored a major victory when a California-based jury ruled Samsung should pay it over $1bn (£620m) in damages. Samsung has had its own courtroom successes, including a ruling in August that Apple had infringed two of its wireless communication patents in South Korea. It resulted in an order for the iPhone maker to pay 40m won ($35,000; £22,000) in damages. The US lawsuit involving the iPhone 5 dates back to April when a complaint about other devices was filed in the Northern District of California. The case is due to go to trial in March 2014. It involves two so-called Frand patents - technologies Samsung has an obligation to licence on ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory"" terms because they are recognised as being essential to data transmission standards. In other words, if Apple agrees to pay what is deemed to be a fair rate then Samsung will be obliged to let it use the technologies. The other six disputed innovations are feature patents, and in theory Samsung could force Apple's products off the shelves if it does not remove the functions from the devices. Patent consultant Florian Mueller listed details of the disputed patents on his blog earlier this year, noting that Samsung owned about 30,000 US patents in total. Several of these include 4G LTE technologies which the Seoul-based company has hinted could be the basis of further lawsuits. 'Excessive protection' HTC, Motorola, Microsoft, RIM and other tech firms are also involved in ongoing US lawsuits. Legal experts have expressed concern at some of the tactics being used, including Judge Richard Posner who threw out a case involving Motorola and Apple in June, rebuking both firms. He has now followed this up with a blog post in which he calls for an overhaul of the law regarding software patents. ""Nowadays most software innovation is incremental, created by teams of software engineers at modest cost, and also ephemeral - most software innovations are quickly superseded,"" he wrote. ""Software innovation tends to be piecemeal - not entire devices, but components, so that a software device (a cellphone, a tablet, a laptop, etc) may have tens of thousands of separate components (bits of software code or bits of hardware), each one arguably patentable. ""The result is huge patent thickets, creating rich opportunities for trying to hamstring competitors by suing for infringement - and also for infringing, and then challenging the validity of the patent when the patentee sues you."" The judge said that 20-year-long patent protection made sense for pharmaceutical drugs which require development costs running to hundreds of millions of dollars, need extensive testing and subsequently remain on the market for decades. He said such factors did not apply to software, adding that a firm that invented a new technology would benefit from being the first to use it and would also gain a reputation for innovation. ""My general sense... bolstered by an extensive academic literature, is that patent protection is on the whole excessive and that major reforms are necessary,"" he wrote. The tech news site Ars Technica, which was first to report the blog, noted that Judge Posner did not have the power to shape US patent policy, but added that his views were likely to be discussed by policymakers.",Samsung has added Apple's latest handset to a US patent lawsuit claiming the iPhone 5 infringes eight of its technologies.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On this week's Tech Tent we hear from a sceptical railway engineer who doubts whether the system is technically or commercially feasible. We also find out what one of the world's most influential cybersecurity bloggers thinks about the bug in millions of computer chips - and we ask whether virtual reality will take off in the classroom. Hyperloop's technology in question Anything that Elon Musk says is taken very seriously given his track record in defying sceptics who thought he would never build a sporty electric car or a reusable rocket. So when he floated the idea of the Hyperloop, a high speed transport system in a vacuum tube, various companies leapt into action. In Davos this week, a company called Hyperloop Transportation Technologies promised that it would be announcing its first commercial track this year. But the project which seems to have got furthest is Virgin Hyperloop One, which has built a 500m test track in Nevada. When I wrote about my visit to that operation last weekend, it sparked a lively debate on Twitter between those who thought I was too negative about the Hyperloop - and some engineers who were deeply sceptical about the technology. On Tech Tent we hear from Virgin Hyperloop's Anita Sengupta who tells us that everything is on track for the first commercial operation in 2021 - and from Gareth Dennis, a railway engineer. ""The fundamental laws of physics are the same for Hyperloop as for high-speed rail,"" says Mr Dennis, a design engineer working for the Arcadis consultancy. He explains that the faster a train goes, the shallower any curve in the track has to be. ""For high-speed rail, the curves have to be 10km long, and that's only at 200mph to 250mph. Hyperloop's going to be hurtling along at 700mph so the track will almost have to be dead straight."" He believes that means that in countries with plenty of built-up areas this will mean putting the Hyperloop in tunnels, a prohibitively expensive business. He also has concerns about the process of switching pods between different tunnels as they approach a station. But his biggest doubt is about the capacity of any Hyperloop line in comparison with something like the UK's HS2 high-speed rail project: ""They are going to have to have as many as 400 pods departing every hour, which requires a huge amount of infrastructure. ""I just don't think that is going to be economically or environmentally viable in the near future."" Hyperloop's backers say the engineering challenges are different from those on high-speed rail and cannot be compared. They believe that big ideas need bold thinkers - but finding governments and investors with the courage to push the button on this kind of project could prove the ultimate challenge. Whatever happened to the chip meltdown? The year began with a major cybersecurity alert over two design flaws in chips which could potentially allow hackers to gain access to millions of devices. Since then, the attempt to mitigate against the risks of Meltdown and Spectre has gathered pace. It has not gone entirely smoothly - this week Intel advised customers to remove a couple of patches after they caused computers to reboot without warning. The Australian cybersecurity blogger Troy Hunt tells us that these are very serious threats. ""The worst thing is they are so pervasive, across so many devices,"" he says. He says the impressive thing about this threat is that it is very sophisticated - which is one reason why a vulnerability in chips dating back many years has only just been discovered. ""It's a bit of a reminder that computing and software is complex - there are things that can go wrong that we may never have thought of before."" But he adds that the comfort for ordinary computer users is that so far, there is no evidence that Meltdown or Spectre has been exploited by hackers. When the news of the flaws first emerged, one US agency advised that the only real answer was to replace all your hardware. And there is the dilemma for the cybersecurity industry - too many bloodcurdling warnings about threats which then fail to materialise may make people tune out when something really dangerous comes along. VR in the classroom Whatever happened to Virtual Reality? A couple of years ago, it was the hottest new technology trend but lately enthusiasm seems to have been dampened by the high price of headsets and some doubts about whether VR really does have uses beyond gaming. One place it is still being heavily touted is in education and at the BETT educational tech fair in London this week, VR was much in evidence. Rich Henderson from Lenovo, which has produced a new relatively cheap standalone headset, told us that according to Lenovo's research, 23% of teachers have tried VR in the classroom, and 97% of those who had, said it improved engagement. Jennifer Holland, programme manager for Daydream at Google, says VR experiences which take pupils to Mars or the Great Barrier Reef provoke ""excitement and wonder"". She says children are also proving eager to take these new learning experiences home with them, continuing education outside the classroom. Sceptics would point out that schools have often found that new technology - from language laboratories to tablets - fails to deliver results after the initial enthusiasm. Schools may need to see more evidence that virtual reality delivers long-term benefits before splashing out on new kit.",Does the technology behind the much-vaunted new transport system Hyperloop really stand up to scrutiny?
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News The woman was hit on the head by the device after it crashed into a building and fell on to her. Detectives are investigating the case, which happened at a gay pride parade in Seattle on Sunday. The incident is the latest in which a person has been injured by a consumer drone that either crashed or cut them with its rotor blades. According to Seattle police's blog, the injured woman's boyfriend caught her as she fell to the ground. One of her friends handed the damaged drone to police, along with photographs of the man they believed was piloting it. A man later contacted the police. The police blog said that the drone weighed about 2lb (0.9kg) and sold for about $1,200 (£770). However, Seattle police did not specify the model or manufacturer. An off-duty firefighter helped treat the 25-year-old woman, who was reported to have made a full recovery. But, according to drone expert Prof David Dunn of the University of Birmingham, the incident illustrated a growing problem. He told the BBC that drones posed a danger because their popularity had outstripped both the regulation and education on how to use them safely. He said that, although it may be considered a heavy-handed approach by some people, the government needed to consider licensing the devices. Last month, the singer Enrique Iglesias fractured his hand onstage at a concert when he was hit by the blades of a camera-equipped drone that he had reached up to take hold of. In December last year, the Brooklyn Daily reported that one of its own photographers had been hurt by a small drone that had hit her in the face. And, in April of the same year, there were reports that an Australian athlete had been hurt by a drone that had fallen from the sky and landed on her.","A man suspected of piloting a drone that knocked a woman unconscious in the US has come forward, police have said."
"An inauguration ceremony was held on Sunday by the country's communications and information technology minister, Mahmoud Vaezi. The state news agency Irna said the initiative would offer ""high quality, high speed"" connections at ""low costs"". But critics suggest the true aim is to tighten the authorities' control over citizens' use of the net. Although Iran already blocks access to overseas-based social media services - including Twitter and Facebook - many users still access them via proxy sites and virtual private networks (VPNs). 'Inefficient' filters The idea behind the project was first made public in 2010, and it was originally intended to be fully operational by 2015. The government says the goal is to create an isolated domestic intranet that can be used to promote Islamic content and raise digital awareness among the public. It intends to replace the current system, in which officials seek to limit which parts of the existing internet people have access to via filters - an effort Mr Vaezi described as being ""inefficient"". ""All domestic activities, services, applications [and] various types of contents... are included in the national internet,"" he declared at the launch. The minister added that the initiative would make it easier to combat cyber-threats. At the ceremony, another official said the Information Technology ministry had recently had to combat several distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks - attempts to overwhelm its computer servers by flooding them with traffic. According to a report by Mehr, another Tehran-based news agency: Local reports state that users' privacy will be respected. But the British human rights campaign group Article 19 has warned that this might not be the case. ""Given Iran's record in violating its human rights commitments based on civil and political (including religious and ethnic) grounds, the development of projects such as the national internet are especially concerning,"" it said in a report published earlier this year. ""The National Internet Project could pave the way for further isolation, surveillance and information retention. ""[It] risks severely isolating the Iranian people from the rest of the online world, limiting access to information and constraining attempts at collective action and public protest.""","Iran has announced it has completed the first phase of its plan to operate a ""national internet""."
"The firm sold on the data to businesses that used it to identify who could afford goods and services, as well as to political parties. The company must make ""fundamental changes"" to how it handles data or face a huge fine, the watchdog said. Experian has said it will appeal. ""We believe the ICO [Information Commissioner's Office]'s view goes beyond the legal requirements,"" the Dublin-based firm said in a statement. ""This interpretation also risks damaging the services that help consumers, thousands of small business and charities, especially as they try to recover from the Covid-19 crisis."" While Experian has made efforts to improve its practices, the ICO said they did not go far enough. The company now has nine months to satisfy the regulator or face fines of up to £20m, or 4% of its global turnover, whichever is higher. 'Invisible processing' The two-year investigation was prompted by a complaint from the campaign group Privacy International. It found that Experian and two other credit reference agencies - Equifax and TransUnion - did a significant amount of ""invisible"" processing of data, meaning that people did not know it was happening. All firms provide a way for people to check their credit score for loans and credit cards. But they are also data brokers, collecting and selling on information gathered from a variety of sources. The report found that the agencies had access to the data of almost every adult in the UK, which was then ""screened, traded, profiled, enriched, or enhanced to provide direct marketing services"". This processing resulted in ""products that were used by commercial organisations, political parties and charities to find new customers and build profiles about people"", the investigation stated. The probe was limited to offline data broking, so did not include data collected about online behaviour. That is being investigated by the ICO separately. Equifax and TransUnion do not face further action from the watchdog because both made changes, including withdrawing some products and services. The report did not specify what these products and services were. All three credit reference agencies failed to clearly explain what they were doing with people's data, said the ICO, despite this being a requirement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ""The data broking sector is a complex eco-system where information appears to be traded widely without consideration for transparency, giving millions of adults in the UK little of no choice or control over their personal data,"" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. Experian still needs to: Privacy International's executive director said other countries should carry out follow-up investigations of their own. ""As the UK regulator notes, people don't even know the names of most of these companies and yet they hold everyone's data,"" said Gus Hosein. ""We believe the deck is stacked against people and this can't continue.""","Credit reference agency Experian has been sharing the personal information of millions of people without consent and must stop, the UK's information commissioner has ruled."
"Digital Minister Matt Warman said £70m is ""still there for the taking"". The gigabit voucher scheme is part of the government's election pledge to bring broadband speeds of up to 1,000Mbps to the whole country by 2025. It says nearly half a million homes have been connected with the help of government subsidies. The average UK broadband speed is around 64Mbps (megabits per second), according to the latest Ofcom figures. Mr Warman said the 2025 target was ambitious and he could commit only to ""getting as close as we can"". ""We're talking about a target that's five years away. We are absolutely confident that we are doing all the right things,"" he said. The total number of ""gigabit capable"" premises in the UK is now 7.5 million - roughly a quarter of the country, the government says. Commercial firms are responsible for the vast majority, ""That's huge progress - we can keep making sure that we make the same kind of progress up to 2025 and beyond,"" Mr Warman said. 'As remote as you could possibly be' Belinda Huckle lives and works in the same building in the Yorkshire Dales, and says the gigabit voucher scheme has been ""transformative"". ""There's a lot of sheep, a lot of hills and it's about an hour round-trip just to get milk. So we're pretty much about as remote as you could possibly be,"" she says. ""More often than not, we would get up really early and the internet would be down. ""And to mitigate that we would have to drive a few miles to a lay-by and sit in a lay-by in the dark with our laptops, hot-spotting into our phones in order to basically conduct business pretty much in the middle of the field."" After applying for the gigabit voucher scheme, she now has a reliable service - and speeds that went from below 20Mbps (when it worked) to 850Mbps. Ms Huckle said the scheme had been excellent - but that government's messages needed to be clearer. ""The Facebook advertising is very misleading, and it's confusing because people think that they're suddenly going to get 15 hundred quid in their pockets… It doesn't work like that."" After applying, however, she says the whole process is ""really frictionless"". The scheme exists because it's not always commercially viable to dig up roads and fields to supply good broadband to some remote places. If you live in a rural area and have average or poor broadband speeds, the scheme allows you to apply for up to £1,500 for personal homes, and £3,500 for businesses, to install a new connection. But the cash is not handed over to individuals - instead, you will have to contact a broadband supplier in your area to handle the subsidy, and two or more residents in a ""group scheme"" are needed to qualify. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it has already handed out 45,000 vouchers, worth more than £90m - although only 29,000 of those connections have so far gone live. The larger part of the government's investment in broadband infrastructure is a £5bn fund promised for the nationwide rollout - but suppliers do not know how it will be allocated. The head of BT's Openreach infrastructure division recently warned that suppliers ""need that plan now"" if the government is to hit its 2025 target. Industry body the Internet Service Providers' Association (Ispa), meanwhile, warns that the sheer scale of the rollout remains a major obstacle. Ispa said that the government needed to take ""urgent action"" to break down barriers to the rollout. The Covid-19 pandemic has also caused problems. Its members ""have had very different experiences, depending on where they are... across the country,"" it said. Local authorities have taken different attitudes to allowing work to proceed and issuing permits. Mr Warman also said that while the focus was on rural connections, some areas that ""have not kept up"" in the largest cities were also being looked at. ""We completely get that there are urban and suburban areas that are commercially viable, but there are parts that are not yet where they need to be - and it has to be a focus,"" he said.",The government is urging struggling rural broadband customers to apply for cash it has set aside to pay for ultra high-speed connections.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It will be limited to residents in the Isle of Wight, the London Borough of Newham and NHS volunteer responders to begin with. The app will be available in Apple and Google's online stores, but users will need to enter a code to activate it. The software will tell users to self-isolate for a fortnight if the app detects they have been close to someone else diagnosed with the virus. Baroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace initiative - had earlier voiced concern about implementing the automated contact-tracing feature because of fears many people who had been falsely flagged might be told to go into quarantine. The app has several other functions, including: It initially works in five languages, with plans to add more soon. The contact-tracing element of the software is based on Google and Apple's privacy-centric system. The developers acknowledge there are still issues with measuring the distance between handsets, meaning some people will be incorrectly logged as being at high risk. Official social distancing guidance says that two people should not be within 2m (6.6ft) of each other for 15 minutes or more. But when trying to detect this, lab tests indicate: However, if the boundary is set at 5m, the accuracy rates radically improve. Then the handsets detect each other in more than 99% of all cases, regardless of whether iPhones or Android devices were involved. This is not useful in practice, but indicates the flaw that caused the original NHS Covid-19 app to be cancelled has been solved. That product often failed to detect cases involving two iPhones because of restrictions imposed on third-party software by Apple. The team behind the new app acknowledges more work needs to be done to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives that occur at 2m, but is optimistic they can achieve this. Part of the problem at present is that Apple and Google refuse to share the raw Bluetooth signal data involved. While the two show no signs of backing down, they will shortly release a new version of their tool that should improve matters. This development has also been welcomed by those involved with Switzerland's SwissCovid app. ""While the updated Google/Apple exposure notification API [application programming interface] still aggregates and shuffles data for privacy reasons, it will expose more information needed by the app to compute exposure more precisely,"" explained Prof Mathias Payer from the EPFL university in Lausanne. 'Battle to persuade' The pilot comes at time when clusters of people testing positive have led to local lockdowns, and major changes are being made to the way England's manual contact-tracing system is run. Test and Trace officials say the motivation for the app is to give ""maximum freedom at minimum risk"", but acknowledge it is not a ""silver bullet"". ""By launching an app that supports our integrated localised approach to NHS Test and Trace, anyone with a smartphone will be able to find out if they are at risk of having caught the virus, quickly and easily order a test, and access the right guidance and advice,"" said Baroness Harding. However, she is not yet ready to say when a national rollout could occur. An academic who had served as an ethical advisor to the original scrapped app was positive about the fact that the trial was not limited to the Isle of Wight this time. ""This time it's a more diverse area - and not just one full of older white people - because it was clear that before very little could be gained from analysis of the demographics"" said Prof Lillian Edwards. But she added that the government still had a ""battle to persuade people"" to install the software. ""The evidence from Italy is that people aren't installing their Immuni contact-tracing app, but they might when the number of infections rises again."" Another public health expert was even more sceptical. ""Even if they have got it working, the app is unlikely to make a difference,"" said Prof Allyson Pollock from Newcastle University. ""The issue is not just the contact tracing but the ability to get people to isolate and quarantine. And that means financial support needs to be provided by the government.""",A trial of the English coronavirus app is getting under way.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The firm said a mix of an advanced sensor and optical image stabilisation tech offered superior night photos and the ability to create ""light painting"" effects with real-time previews. The Chinese company is pitching its P8 handsets as ""premium"" options. But one analyst said the firm still had a ""mountain to climb"". The Shenzhen-headquartered company impressed many reviewers with the design of a smartwatch unveiled at Barcelona's Mobile World Congress in February, which one tech blog described as ""the surprise hit"" of the trade fair. However, Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, said Western consumers still perceived it as being a ""value-for-money brand"". ""Huawei's challenge is how to differentiate a great-looking device from the sea of similar smartphones,"" he added. ""Apple's vice-like grip on the high-end smartphone market has effectively locked out all rivals, with the possible exception of Samsung, which is having to make an eye-watering marketing investment to attract consumers to its new products."" White-colour pixels The new Android-powered phones, which were unveiled in London, come in two sizes - the basic P8 with a 5.2in screen (13.2cm) and the P8max with a larger than normal 6.8in (17.3cm) display. Both feature a 13 megapixel rear camera whose image sensor includes pixels dedicated to measuring white light as well as the more common red, green and blue colour pixels. The firm says this delivers improved images in high contrast and low light situations. In addition, the handset features what the firms claims to be a ""best-in-class"" stabilisation component that minimises camera shake. This allows its shutter to be kept open for longer, helping capture sharp images in dim light. It also permits the device to be put into light-painting mode while operated freehand, letting users draw inside a photo as it's taken by quickly shining light from a small torch across their view. Although this function is available to other smartphones, Huawei says it is unusual in being able to provide a live preview of what the shot look likes, making it easier to achieve the light-based doodles. In addition, four P8 phone can be linked together to provide a multi-cam filming system, allowing users to record video footage containing changes in view. Sony pioneered a similar built-in option in its Xperia handsets last year. Knuckle sensors Although another Chinese handset-maker - Xiaomi - has captured many headlines of late, Huawei ended last year with a bigger market share. It accounted for 6% of global smartphone shipments at the close of 2014, according to CCS Insight. That put it in fourth position behind Lenovo, another Chinese manufacturer, whose figures have been boosted by its recent takeover of Motorola. ""Huawei's new camera technology is impressive and it's invested a lot in the associated software to make it quick, but my concern is that for most consumers the cameras on their smartphones are already good enough,"" said Mr Wood. ""But there is another feature that's interesting: the knuckle sense technology that you to double-tap the screen with your knuckle to take a screenshot - that's going to appeal to the Snapchat generation wanting to capture pictures before they disappear."" Hitler apology Huawei's smartphone launch coincided with that of a lesser-known Chinese manufacturer LeTV. Its new device, Le Max, is the first handset to feature a USB-C port. The facility allows the device to be connected and charged with a reversible cable - similar to Apple's Lightning connector. The announcement has been overshadowed by the fact the firm's chief executive recently apologised after commissioning an advertising campaign featuring a cartoon of Hitler with Apple's logo in the place of a swastika on his armband. Jia Yueting acknowledged that the image was ""insensitive and wrong"" after posting a still on Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like service. The ad now features a cartoon king instead. Apple has not commented on the affair.","Huawei has unveiled its latest flagship phones with cameras that it says are capable of creating ""professional"" looking photos and videos."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter An editor for Dutch broadcaster VPRO had the idea, after the Netherlands won last year's Eurovision Song Contest. And it grew into an international effort after this year's contest was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The winning song, Beautiful the World, was inspired by nature's recovery from the bushfires earlier this year. A total of 13 teams took part, from the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Belgium, the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland. The Australian team, called Uncanny Valley in a nod to how humans and robots may one day merge, was made up of maths, computer-science and social-anthropology students, as well as music producers. The melody and lyrics were written by an AI system, trained with audio samples of koalas, kookaburras and tasmanian devils. 'Douze points' The public voted overwhelmingly for the song. A panel of AI experts, Vincent Koops, Anna Huang and Ed Newton-Rex, also rated it highly but gave the full ""douze points"" to the German team, Dadabots x Portrait XO. The panel were ""amazed by the wide range of innovative approaches to using AI to create music"". ""Composing a song with AI is hard because you have all the creative challenges that come with song-writing, but you also have to juggle getting the machine learning right,"" they said. ""The teams not only pushed the boundaries of their personal creativity, but also gave the audience a look into the exciting future of human-AI musical collaboration."" Senior editor at VPRO Karen van Dijk, who came up with the idea for the contest, said all the teams had made the most out of the creative possibilities of artificial intelligence. ""In my opinion, some songs would not be out of place in the official Eurovision Song Contest.""

"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The program, set up by private firm Persistent Surveillance Systems, used camera-equipped planes to capture what was happening across a vast urban area. The decision to abandon the scheme followed a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). It said the system disproportionately targeted people of colour. ""Baltimore's termination of its unconstitutional spy plane program is a hard-fought victory for all Baltimoreans, especially for Black leaders who challenged this and communities of colour who are disproportionately targeted by this surveillance,"" said Brett Max Kaufman, a senior lawyer for the ACLU. But David Rocah, a senior lawyer with ACLU Maryland, said the legal case still needed to be heard. ""While we applaud Mayor Scott's decision to abandon this unique threat to privacy... the law is clear that the city can't intentionally duck accountability by suddenly bailing on its years-long defence of this technology on the eve of next month's appeals court hearing,"" he said. The system used two Cessna propeller planes equipped with a 192 megapixel colour video camera system, which flew over Baltimore at altitudes of up to 9,000ft (2,740m) up to 11 hours a day. Military surveillance According to the police, the planes were used to locate witnesses, suspects and vehicles related to serious crimes such as murders and armed robberies. In deciding to end the pilot, officials said that there was no proof it had been effective in its aim to reduce crime. Councilman Mark Conway, who chairs the city's public safety and government operations committee, said: ""If we want to bring down violence in Baltimore, we need proven public safety strategies that respect residents' constitutional rights while engaging communities holistically. The surveillance plane did not strike that balance."" And Mayor Brandon Scott, who was a critic of the program, said the city would be better ""investing in neighbourhoods and people, not just relying on some plane"". The program, officially known as Aerial Investigation Research (AIR), initially ran in secret in 2016. It caused controversy because of its secretive nature, but also because it was run by a private company and privately funded by Arnold Ventures, a philanthropic fund run by a billionaire former hedge fund manager. Persistent Surveillance Systems was set up by Ross McNutt, an astronautical engineer. He first developed a surveillance system for the US military which was used in Iraq, and later decided to launch it to fight crime in cities.","Lawmakers in Baltimore have voted to end a controversial aerial surveillance program, which had seen spy planes constantly monitoring the city."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive. ""We consider it to be a scam,"" Stephen Knight, operations director for London Trading Standards told the BBC. His said his team is working with City of London Police's Action Fraud squad. They are seeking a court order to take down the company's website. ""People who are vulnerable need protection from this kind of unscrupulous trading,"" he added. The intervention follows an examination of the device, which was first reported by the BBC. The vendor - BioShield Distribution - had previously said the device was backed by ""research"", but has not responded to the latest development. 'Holographic nano-layer catalyser' The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists. The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"". ""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds. Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80. But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage. ""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities. And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says. 'Time dilation' Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key. Their conclusion was that trading standards bodies should carry out their own investigations. A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"". 'Sensitive information' Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield - but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said. ""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons."" And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable. ""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said. ""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way."" 'More dreams' Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product. But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News. And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields. It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines. Update: Since this article was published, Mr Laghezza has informed us that his role as a director of BioShield Distribution Ltd was limited to assisting the company in setting up, and he had completed his work within three months. Companies House records show he resigned as a director on 22 May 2020.",Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.
"It follows complaints by Apple and Microsoft after Motorola tried to block sales of their products. They said that Motorola - which is in the process of being taken over by Google - had failed to license ""essential"" technologies on fair and reasonable terms. Motorola denies any wrongdoing. ""The commission will examine whether Motorola's behaviour amounts to an abuse of a dominant market position,""a statement from the commission said. The dispute centres on Motorola's use of Frand-type patents. These involve technologies that are deemed to be part of an industry standard and therefore must be offered for a reasonable fee to anyone willing to pay. ""Motorola Mobility is confident that a thorough investigation will demonstrate that it has honoured its Frand obligations and complied with anti-trust laws,"" a statement from the firm said. ""[We] will continue to work closely with the European Commission to resolve this matter as soon as practicable."" Injunctions Apple has clashed with Motorola over the amount it should pay for its use of a patent for a ""method for performing a countdown functionduring a mobile-originated transfer for a packet radio system"". The dispute led a German court to order a ban of certain iPad and iPhone models in Germany last year - a ruling which was later suspended. Apple has also been forced to suspend its push email service to German customers as a result of another clash. Microsoft faces a separate complaint in Germany in a fortnight's time over its use of H.264 video-compression technology patents claimed by Motorola. Microsoft announced on Monday that it was moving its European software distribution centre from Germany to the Netherlands in order to prevent a potential ban of shipments of its Windows 7 system software and Xbox 360 gaming consoles. ""We would have preferred to keep our European distribution centre in Germany, where it has been for many years,"" a statement from Microsoft said. ""Unfortunately the risk from disruption's from Motorola's patent litigation is simply too high."" Patent consultant Florian Mueller blogged that the commission's interventionmight influence the outcome of the case. ""Germany is the only EU member state in which Motorola is suing Apple and Microsoft over standard-essential patents,"" he wrote. ""The commission's decision to launch these formal investigations should serve as food for thought for certain judges in the largest EU member state who have shown a worrying tendency in recent years to put patent law far above anti-trust law."" Enforcement The European Commission's action follows earlier warnings that it had concerns about Motorola's enforcement tactics, which it expressed after approving Google's takeover of the firm. ""The holders of standard-essential patents have considerable market power,"" said competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia. ""This market power can be used to harm competition... I don't need to tell you that this is unacceptable, and I am determined to use anti-trust enforcement to prevent such hold-up by patent holders.""

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Huawei was blacklisted by the Trump administration in May over claims it posed a threat to the US's security. That prevents American companies from providing it with their latest tech. Brad Smith said he did not believe the US's security would be ""undermined"" by letting Huawei's customers use its operating system or Office apps. ""Governments around the world are going to address their national security needs,"" he told BBC News. ""But we believe it would be a mistake at the same time to try to draw some new digital iron curtain down the Pacific Ocean - I think that would hold back the United States, would hold back the democracies of the world. ""We're one of a number of companies that has applied with the US Commerce department so that we can continue to provide our software operating system to Huawei for devices like laptops. ""There may be some issues that require some approaches around 5G but one should ask whether that is the right approach for all of the equipment that a particular company might make."" US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in July his department would issue licences to exempt companies from the ban on selling technology to Huawei, as long as there was no ""threat to US national security"". This would not have affected a separate order from US President Donald Trump that effectively banned Huawei from selling 5G equipment to US telecom networks. However, the Commerce Department does not appear to have issued any such licences despite receiving more than 100 requests. As a result, Huawei will launch its latest Android flagship handset on Wednesday without some of Google's key apps, including YouTube, Maps and its Play Store. BBC News has learned it will instead pre-install the Huawei Mobile Service suite of software on the Mate 30 handset, providing in-house alternatives to Google's products. In addition, Huawei intends to offer a service in phone shops to teach users how to load Google's software on to the Mate 30 themselves. For its part, the Shenzhen-based company denies it poses a cyber-security risk because the Chinese government could make it compromise its customers. ""Huawei's devices and networks are not a threat to the United States, or any country,"" its website states. ""We fully abide by all local laws and regulations in every nation we operate in."" 'Right balance' Mr Smith is Microsoft's longest-serving executive and doubles as its chief legal officer. His comments were made during a wider interview given to the BBC to promote a book about Microsoft's views on regulation and other topical issues. Mr Smith acknowledged the Commerce Department needed ""time to consider"" which companies to grant licences to. But he added: ""We don't think that the security of any country is undermined by people being able to use our search service or use our productivity applications, to use Outlook or Word. ""We think that actually spreads opportunities for people."" Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, has described his company as being in ""a life or death crisis"" and there has been speculation the Chinese government could retaliate by putting restrictions on US technology companies in turn. Mr Smith signalled Apple and others were more exposed to such a threat but added he was also concerned about how research partnerships could be affected. ""We don't have as big a business in China as some other tech companies - only 1.8% of Microsoft's revenue is generated in China,"" he said. ""At the same time, we are worried about the impact. ""We would worry if we can no longer bring together researchers at Cambridge University or the west coast of the United States or Beijing or Bangalore. ""That's where we're going to continue to find the solutions that the world needs. So yes, we are worried if we can't step back and have countries strike the right balance.""",Microsoft's president has called on the US to end a ban on it supplying Huawei with Windows software for the Chinese company's computers.
"Mr Pichai was being quizzed by members of the House Judiciary Committee about the way his tech firm runs it business. Google was accused of having ""programmed"" bias against conservative views into its algorithms. Mr Pichai denied the accusation saying he had ""issues"" with studies that claimed to show the firm's search results excluded right-wing views. He was asked by Democrat committee member Zoe Lofgren why, when she googled the word ""idiot"" under images, a picture of President Donald Trump came up. In response, Mr Pichai explained that keywords were matched against billions of page results and ranked for relevance, popularity and how other people are using the word. Privacy protection Republican committee member Lamar Smith said conservative voices were being ""muted"" via Google's search results. ""Such actions pose a grave threat to our democratic form of government,"" he said. ""This does not happen by accident, it is baked in to the algorithms."" Mr Pichai said independent studies had not uncovered any bias and added that his business was ""transparent"" about the way its search results were generated. ""We evaluate our studies and our research results,"" said Mr Pichai. ""We have a wide variety of sources, from both left and right."" He added that it was ""impossible"" for any individual or group of individuals to manipulate its algorithms. In response to a further question about perceived bias, he said: ""I'm confident we don't approach our work with any political bias."" He added: ""It's important that we look at outcomes and assess that there's no evidence of bias."" Future search Mr Pichai was also asked about the work Google was doing in China on the controversial ""dragonfly"" project. This is believed to be a search engine drawn up under the oversight of the Chinese government that would censor topics at the behest of the regime. Mr Pichai said ""the number of engineers on the project have varied over time, but at one point we had over 100 people working on it"", in response to questioning from Republican committee member Keith Rothfus. Democratic committee member Sheila Jackson Lee suggested the work could ""censor a Chinese person's lifeline to democracy"". She asked: ""How can you do that?"" In response, Mr Pichai said: ""Right now we have no plans to launch in China. We don't have a search product there. He said all efforts were ""internal"" and did not currently involve discussions with the Chinese government. ""Our core mission is to provide users with access to information and getting access to information is an important human right,"" said Mr Pichai. ""We are always compelled across the world to try hard to provide that information."" In response to further questions, Mr Pichai said the company would be ""fully transparent"" with politicians if the company released a search service in China. Mr Pichai was questioned extensively about the amount of information that Google collected and what it did with the ""mountains"" of data it gathered. The Google boss said many times that it gave people ""choices"" about the types of data it collected and that it regularly reminded people about their privacy settings. He said 20 million people a day adjusted their privacy settings to change the types of information they let Google amass. Mr Pichai had been under growing pressure to testify after he snubbed an earlier hearing called by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Executives from Facebook and Twitter attended the September event where they faced tough questions. In a document released before his testimony, Mr Pichai paid tribute to staff at Google and said it had worked to ""empower people around the world, especially in the US"". The Congressional session comes the day after the search giant announced that it was shutting down its Google+ social network. The decision came after it found a vulnerability that could have exposed data on 52.2 million users.",Google chief Sundar Pichai has faced accusations of political bias from US politicians.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter, BBC News It suggests there will be 47.7 million public hotspots worldwide by the end of 2014. France currently has the most hotspots, followed by the US and UK. Hotspots are designed to fill the gaps in coverage left by mobile networks and are often offered free of charge. The study is one of the first comprehensive looks at the distribution of global wi-fi. A clickable map of hotspots around the world shows the numbers in each region and where they are located - in homes, on trains, planes, airports and retail outlets. Homespots Over the next four years, global hotspot numbers will grow to more than 340 million, the equivalent of one wi-fi hotspot for every 20 people on earth, the research finds. But this growth will not be evenly distributed. While in North America there will be one hotspot for every four people by 2018, in Africa it will be one for every 408. While Europe currently has the most dense wi-fi coverage, Asia will overtake it by 2018, according to the report. The research suggests that the vast majority of hotspots - nearly 34 million - are in homes. These hotspots are part of a growing trend to extend home wi-fi to the local community. Increasingly firms such as BT are turning home wi-fi routers into public wi-fi hotspots which will provide free net access to other subscribers to the network. It does so without affecting the bandwidth allowance of the customer whose home it is in. US provider Comcast caused controversy when it introduced its public home wi-fi service in the summer because customers were not given the option to opt out before receiving it. Such ""homespot"" public wi-fi will see explosive growth rising to more than 325 million in 2018 and taking wi-fi ""from the cities to the suburbs"", according to the research. ""Every second home you walk past will be a public hotspot that you can use if you are part of that provider's network,"" said June Bower, chief marketing officer at iPass. There are nearly 7.5 million hotspots in shops, cafes and hotels and and a much smaller number - nearly 11,000, on trains, planes and in airports. But wi-fi on transport is also set to grow massively, the report indicates. Google wi-fi Unlike the mobile network, which tends to be run by three or four big players in each country, wi-fi hotspots are controlled by many different providers. According to the research, more than 50% of all commercial hotspots are controlled by brands whose core business is not telecommunications. Run by cafes, hoteliers and retailers, it can make the network ""somewhat chaotic"", according to Ms Bower. ""At the moment you have to have a separate log-in for every hotspot and ultimately the winning providers are those that will offer the easier access experience,"" she said. And there is opportunity there for the big technology brands. ""Everyone has a Google log-in. Google could become a hotspot provider as could Facebook or Apple."" In fact Google is already dabbling in the wi-fi market. In 2013, it made a deal with Starbucks to offer free wi-fi to 7,000 coffee shops in the US and it recently filed a request with the US Federal Communications Commission to test high-speed wireless spectrum at several locations in California.","The UK has one wi-fi hotspot for every 11 people and worldwide there is one for every 150, new research from wi-fi provider iPass indicates."
"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter It found that 89% of interactions with phones were unprompted, with only 11% responding to an alert. Group chats were also considered a ""source of distress"" for participants in the study. Scrolling features on Instagram and Facebook led to the longest interactions, the research found. Checking your smartphone is largely caused by “an urge of the user to interact with their phone that seems to occur in an almost automatic manner, just as a smoker would light a cigarette”, the study says. The experiment analysed the smartphone use of 37 people with an average age of 25 in the UK, Germany, and France. Participants were equipped with cameras that allowed the users to film their daily lives from a first-person perspective. In total, 1,130 interactions were recorded for research by Maxi Heitmayer and Prof Saadi Lahlou, published on Science Direct. Why people used their phones: Although group chats were considered a “source of distress”, users said the messages contained within them were largely unimportant. Emails were ranked as the most important notification for participants in the study. Users also spent less time on their phone when with other people, and the longest interactions took place on public transport or at home. Avoid the temptation Some participants seemed surprised at the automatic nature of their interactions. “I wouldn’t consider myself someone who isn’t attached to their phone much,” one participant said. “But seeing this has made me realise that I don’t even remember picking it up. I think I use it a lot more than I let myself believe.” “I don’t remember getting my phone out. When I see that moment, I don’t remember doing that ... and I’m surprised that I keep checking it,” another participant said. The act of checking a phone has become a need for many users, rather than using the device for communication, said Prof Saadi Lahlou, co-author of the study and chair of social psychology at LSE. “This is a serious issue, especially for children, and we are running into the dark without having fully understood how these devices are changing our way of living. “We must learn tricks to avoid the temptation when we want to concentrate or have good social relations. To do like the cowboys did with their gun when they entered saloons: leave it outside! Or at least shut it down. ""Very important and urgent things are rare. Most things can wait a few hours - you are not going to miss out much anyway.” Dr Linda Kaye, from the Department of Psychology at Edge Hill University, said more research should be done to understand how interactions with smartphones related to executing a specific function or just fulfilling a habit. ""This may help uncover a bit more about whether these behaviours are driven by specific human needs, and how these behaviours help fulfil these, or whether they are simply behaviours for their own sake,"" she added.","Smartphone addiction is unlikely to be caused by notifications, a study by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) suggests."
"In an open letter, the firm warned that its YouTube and Search features could be ""dramatically worse"" if new rules were brought in. It also added that users' data could be shared. But the Australian competition regulator said Google's letter was ""misinformation"". Over the past few months, the Australian government has been preparing legislation which will make Google and Facebook pay local publishers for their content. Today, Google has said it will fight the regulation which the government says is designed to create ""a level playing field"" for news outlets. In an open letter, Google's Australia managing director Mel Silva, wrote: ""The way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new regulation. ""You've always relied on Google Search and YouTube to show you what's most relevant and helpful to you. We could no longer guarantee that under this law."" Google Search and YouTube services would be ""dramatically worse"" and the new regulation ""could lead to your data being handed over to big news businesses"", Ms Silva said. What are the proposals? Last month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission published draft legislation which called on internet companies such as Facebook and Google to pay for content. It would allow news companies to negotiate as a bloc with tech giants for content which appears in their news feeds and search results. The draft code covers other matters too, including notifying news companies of changes to algorithms. Penalties could be up to A$10m (£5m; $7m) per breach, or 10% of the company's local turnover. Today, the competition regulator said Google's open letter ""contains misinformation"" about the proposed law. ""Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so,"" Rod Sims, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman said in a statement. ""Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so."" Mr Sims said the new regulations would ""address a significant bargaining power imbalance"" between Australian news media and internet organisations. ""A healthy news media sector is essential to a well-functioning democracy,"" he added.",Google has attacked a new Australian law forcing tech giants to pay local news outlets - saying it could threaten search services in the country.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter How typically Apple. Except that the computer was Microsoft's Surface Studio. Tonight Apple is holding its own event, and is expected to unveil new versions of the Mac. The pressure is on, and not just because it's been so long since the Mac line-up was refreshed - it is 1,043 days since the top-of-the line Mac Pro was released and the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are also looking a bit tired. Read more: Apple adds Touch Bar to laptops Microsoft has been working quietly to rebuild a reputation in Windows hardware, with the well-received Surface tablets and laptops now joined by a top-end desktop PC. At $2,999 - probably at least £3,000 when you add in VAT - the Surface Studio will have quite a limited market. But its effect on the image of dull old Windows will be much more important to Microsoft. Meanwhile, Apple's wider reputation as an innovative company - and a much cooler business than Microsoft - is coming into question. After the Surface Studio launch Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the cloud storage firm Box, sent out this tweet: ""Microsoft's hardware + software strategy is producing some compelling results. It's almost as if Steve Jobs was right all along."" That sparked this response from the former Apple executive and creator of the iPod Tony Fadell: ""Not almost - he was & still is right! Except it appears that Apple has forgotten this very valuable lesson."" He linked to a story claiming that Apple had given up on its project to build a car. Even Apple loyalists are beginning to ask just when the next really innovative product is coming along. During Tuesday's conference call for analysts following Apple's fourth quarter results, most questions focused on the details of the company's financial performance which despite a rather flat year still looks hugely impressive. But a couple of analysts gently probed Tim Cook about where the next big money-spinner to follow the iPhone would come from. Was the company still interested in building a car? What about making a TV and perhaps buying a media business? Any interest in using Apple's expertise in artificial intelligence to build a voice-controlled speaker like Amazon's Echo? You won't be surprised to hear that Mr Cook ducked and dived around all these questions - Apple never previews its product plans. He did say television was still ""of intense interest"" to him and others at Apple, the car space was also ""interesting"", and as for a virtual assistant in your home, well Siri on your phone was much more useful. But, asked another analyst, does Apple have a grand strategy, does it know what it wants to do over the next three to five years? ""We've got the strongest pipeline we've ever had and we're really confident about what's in it"" was all Tim Cook would say. The trouble is, he has said something very similar before, notably at the beginning of 2014 when he said in reply to another question about innovation: ""I think customers are going to love what we're going to do… We have zero issue coming up with things we want to do that we can disrupt in a major way. The challenge is always to focus [on] the very few that deserve our full energy."" Later that year there was a brand new product, the Apple Watch. But although it looks the most accomplished of the smartwatches on the market, it has hardly settled the doubts about innovation at Apple under Tim Cook. This year the most intriguing product to come out of the iPhone 7 launch in September was a wireless headset that integrates with Siri, a kind of virtual assistant in your ears. The AirPods were due to go on sale by the end of October, but now we learn that they aren't ready and there is no news on when they will be. It's a small hiccup, but one that seems to indicate that Apple's innovation engine isn't firing on all cylinders. Now, let's be clear, the Apple logo still shines brightly from all those MacBook Airs in any vaguely creative business, or in the front row of most tech conferences. That isn't likely to change soon - although it will be interesting to see if the new Surface Book laptop's claim of 16 hours battery life tempts many to convert. But the eyes of the tech community will be on today's event in Cupertino, looking for something even vaguely radical in the new Mac line-up. If Tim Cook does not deliver, the low-level grumbling about whatever happened to the Steve Jobs legacy will only grow louder. Check back later here for my first thoughts on what Apple announces. Update: So, yes, Apple did deliver innovation in unveiling the new line of MacBook Pros. The Touch Bar is a smart way of giving users a new interface with their computers while differentiating it from the touchscreen iPad. And bringing Touch ID to the laptop will be welcomed by those who appreciate the convenience of using a fingerprint to log on - and by ecommerce companies looking forward to more business from identifiable customers. But it took 90 minutes for Apple to unveil a new and rather limited TV app and an upgrade, albeit a significant one, to just one computer. It surely needs to quicken the pace of innovation if it is to prove that Mac is still cooler than PC.","This week saw the unveiling of a futuristic computer in a very slick presentation. The giant touchscreen device looked gorgeous, did amazing things - and came with an extortionate price tag."
"But to be offered as an option, search firms will have to compete over what to pay Google if users select them. The decision to offer a choice when setting up devices comes after Google was fined heavily by the European Commission for abusing its position. But one competitor has warned that users might lose out as a result. ""If the highest bidder wins the contract and not the best search engine, then the user is the biggest loser,"" said Dr Marc Al-Hames, chief executive at Cliqz, a search firm based in Munich, Germany. ""The choice should be about selecting the most private or innovative provider."" Search auction Google was fined €4.3bn ($4.8bn; £3.72bn) for abusing its market position in July 2018. It has now said that, beginning in 2020, Android users in the European Economic Area (EEA) - a broader market than the EU - will be shown a screen giving them a choice of four possible search providers to use as default on their devices. One of these options will always be Google but the other three will be chosen from the highest-bidding rival search firms. A separate bidding process will exist for each country. ""It's correct that the new screen will be based on an auction,"" a Google spokeswoman told the BBC. Google will still allocate a total of three search providers for users to choose from, even if they don't all meet the minimum criteria. ""The auction winners, and Google, will be ordered randomly in the choice screen,"" the tech giant said on a web page about the change. The new search provider choice screen will appear only on Android phones where Google's own search app is pre-installed. Earlier this year, Google announced it would make changes to how its search results within the EU were displayed. This involved directing users to rival price-comparison websites and merchants selling products.",Android phone and tablet users in the European Union are to be given a chance to install one of Google's rivals as default search provider.
"The scientists claim that a thigh bone found in August contains remarkably well-preserved marrow cells, which could form the starting point of the experiment. The team claim that the cloning could be complete within the next five years. But others have cast doubt on whether such a thing is possible. Mother cow? The team, from the Siberian mammoth museum and Japan's Kinki University, said that they planned to extract a nucleus from the animal's bone marrow and insert it into the egg of an African elephant. Similar procedures have been done before with mixed results. In 2009it was reportedthat the recently extinct Pyrenean ibex was brought back to life briefly using 10-year-old DNA from the animal's skin. The cloned ibex died within minutes of being born, due to breathing difficulties. The Roslin Institute, famous for cloning Dolly the sheep, no longer conducts cloning work but haspublished some thoughtson the possibilities of bringing extinct species back to life. It said it was extremely unlikely such an experiment would be successful, especially using an elephant surrogate. ""First, a suitable surrogate mother animal is required. For the mammoth this would need to be a cow (as best biological fit) but even here the size difference may preclude gestation to term,"" it said. The success rate for such an experiment would be in the range of 1-5%, it said. The second issue would be the need for viable whole cells. ""If there are intact cells in this tissue they have been 'stored' frozen. However, if we think back to what actually happened to the animal - it died, even if from the cold, the cells in the body would have taken some time to freeze. This time lag would allow for breakdown of the cells, which normally happens when any animal dies. Then the carcass would freeze. So it is unlikely that the cells would be viable,"" it said. Assuming that viable cells are found it becomes a numbers game, it went on. ""Let's say that one in a thousand cells were nevertheless viable, practical issues come into play. Given that we have an efficiency of 1% cloning for livestock species and if only one in a thousand cells are viable then around 100,000 cells would need to be transferred,"" it said. Hybrid Charles Foster, a fellow at Green Templeton College, Oxford, seemed more optimistic. ""The idea of mammoth cloning isn't completely ridiculous. ""How the resultant embryos would fare beyond the stage of a few cells is more or less unknown,"" he said. While most of the genetic coding of the embryo would come from the mammoth, some would come from the elephant ovum. ""We really don't know what the contribution of that cytoplasmic material is, or how it would interact with 'alien' DNA,"" he said. It would however mean that, even if successful, the clone would be a hybrid rather than a pure mammoth.",Scientists from Russia and Japan are undertaking a Jurassic Park-style experiment in an effort to bring the woolly mammoth out of extinction.
"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter On Wednesday, four of the biggest names in tech will give evidence to members of the US Congress. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Sundar Pichai (Google), Tim Cook (Apple) and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) will all be grilled. Jeff Bezos - the world's richest man - has never testified before either house. They have never all been quizzed together. How these tech bosses do, how they stand up to scrutiny, could be a defining moment in their future relationship with government. Central to the interrogation will be whether these tech giants are simply too big. The Covid pandemic has put this into sharp focus. Where other companies have struggled, Big Tech companies have thrived. Together they are now worth $5tn dollars. It's led to accusations that - just like the banks - they are simply too big to fail. The number of complaints levelled at these companies are so numerous they are too many to name individually here. What are they likely to say? In pre-released comments, Mark Zuckerberg argued that Facebook had become successful ""the American way"" - providing products that people find valuable after starting with nothing. ""Our story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation,"" he said. But he acknowledged that there were concerns about the size and perceived power of technology companies and that there should be a more active role for governments and regulators - and updated rules for the internet. Jeff Bezos posted his opening statement to Congress. ""At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,"" he said. ""I know what Amazon could do when we were 10 people. I know what we could do when we were 1,000 people, and when we were 10,000 people. And I know what we can do today when we're nearly a million."" ""I believe Amazon should be scrutinized,"" he added. ""We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colours."" Commanding position The general theme is that these companies don't just run services - they own the internet's utilities. The charge is that they use that commanding position unfairly at the expense of others. Take one of the criticisms against Amazon, for example, that it promotes its own products over others on its Amazon marketplace. Or Apple charging a 30% cut on the money generated from apps that use the App Store. The complaint from app makers: where else do we go to sell our apps? Apple and Google (which respectively own iOS and Android, the operating systems of almost all the world's smartphones) control the market, and so control who gets to play and who doesn't. And they of course get to set the charges. Google too, with its dominant search engine, has been accused (and fined) before, for burying competitor searches. Once again, the accusation is that no one company should have such a commanding position in an essential part of our internet. And there are general criticisms that can be levelled at all the tech giants too. For example the alleged Copy/Acquire/Kill strategies that all four are accused of using. Copy others' ideas, buy a company that threatens you - and even potentially kill it off. Is this just shrewd, albeit ruthless business? Or is this Big Tech flexing its muscle unfairly? Here's why this has been such a difficult area to police. Traditionally, anti-competition law - in this case ""anti-trust"" law - has been focused on consumer pricing. In a typical monopoly or cartel, there's a simple test. Are consumers paying more because of a lack of competition? The US ""trusts"" of the early 20th Century - from which the anti-trust legislation derives its name - were found to be driving up prices. Companies like Standard Oil and railway companies used their dominant position to hurt consumers. That's much harder to prove with these tech companies. For example Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are free. Amazon often drives down prices to beat competition. Google's search engine is free. YouTube - owned by Google - is free. And apps on iPhones can often be downloaded for free. So what's the problem? That is the heart of the argument. Critics say that these companies hurt consumers in a more subtle way, killing off smaller companies and strangling other businesses. The charge is that they are in fact damaging the economy. That's what legislators are looking to examine. Anti-trust campaigners have already lost one battle before the hearing even begins. They wanted to have the tech bosses grilled one by one. ""We want to leave as little room as possible for them to hide behind each other,"" Sarah Miller, from the American Economics Liberties Project, told me last week. But that's not going to happen. They'll be questioned together and the hearing will - perhaps aptly - be virtual. There are also worries that members of Congress will use the occasion to grandstand - to strut and preen - rather than asking the more difficult technical questions that might catch them out. Off-topic questions are also likely - particularly for Mark Zuckerberg. For example, Facebook is currently the focus of an advertising boycott. It's accused of being too slow in removing racist and hateful content, and that could well be a line of questioning. And of course, ahead of the US elections, Facebook should expect incoming from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. Democrats are generally concerned about far-right content on the platform, Republicans that the company is structurally left-wing. And of course there are still concerns of foreign interference. Expect China to come up too - and for it to be brought up by the tech bosses. With companies like TikTok and Huawei attracting the ire of the Trump administration, one defence will go something like: ""Break us up, overregulate us, and you give Chinese tech companies more power."" Trying to prise the four away from their scripts is going to be the toughest job. That worked most effectively during Mr Zuckerberg's interrogation on Capitol Hill in 2018. But that's harder said than done. Congress has a big opportunity here. The chance to really cross-examine these powerful men doesn't come often, and the evidence they give could shape their future relationship with government and their customers. But whatever happens on Wednesday, this won't be end of the story. Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee's anti-trust panel said it would hold a hearing in September to discuss Google's dominance in online advertising.","Unprecedented is a dangerous word in journalism, but this really hasn't happened before."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter This week Google acted to ban crypto-currency advertising, while Facebook banned a far-right group. Tech Tent looks at growing evidence that the social media firms are now actively editing what appears on their platforms, rather than just sitting back and allowing their users complete freedom to share any kind of content. We hear from the South by Southwest festival where the usual optimism about the potential of tech - this after all was where Twitter took off - was replaced by anxiety about the damage social media can cause. London's Mayor Sadiq Khan made a speech giving examples of the online abuse he'd received, warning that this could deter people from entering politics. He is not the first politician to say ""something must be done"" about social media but he told the BBC that this kind of pressure was necessary: ""We can't assume tech companies will find solutions by themselves, they've got to be chivvied and cajoled to take action."" It was almost certainly a coincidence but a couple of days later Facebook did act, removing the pages belonging to the far-right groups Britain First and its leader and deputy leader. They had ignored a final written warning to stop posting material designed to promote the hatred of minority groups. Facebook had been under pressure for months to explain why Britain First was allowed to use its platform, given the fact that its Community Standards page states that organisations that promote hatred against these groups are not permitted a presence. It is clear that its social media megaphone, with its 2 million followers, was an extraordinarily effective platform for the group's attacks on Islam - indeed without Facebook there may not be much left of Britain First. The fact that the company finally acted will be seen by politicians of all kinds as proof that pressure can work - which means that Facebook can expect plenty more from across the political spectrum. Crypto-currency ads banned For Google - the world's leading advertising platform - it was another kind of content that proved unwelcome this week. The search giant announced that from June, it would stop carrying advertising for certain financial products including ""crypto-currencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, crypto-currency exchanges, crypto-currency wallets and crypto-currency trading advice)"". Google does not really explain why it is fighting shy of the crypto-currency gold rush - which must be a lucrative source of revenue - except to say these are unregulated or speculative products. You might expect Coinbase, one of the world's leading exchanges for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, to be pretty annoyed about this. But its UK boss Zeeshan Feroz seemed pretty calm when he talked to Tech Tent. He told us that the ban was designed to curb false advertising, such as ""celebrity endorsements of investment products that promise to double your money in 10 days"", - and he welcomed that. But he said the ban was too broad, insisting just like everyone else I've ever met in the crypto-currency business that his firm was very different from all of those fast buck operators. ""We are not in it just for the investment, our mission is to build an open financial system that entails these currencies being used for far more than just investment. We're trying to fundamentally redesign the financial system."" The evangelists of crypto-currencies and the blockchain will tell you that their industry is just like the web in 1994, poised to transform the way we live. But it seems that the biggest force on the web is not ready to buy into that message quite yet.

"Companies cited losing access to talent and funding as major risks when Britain leaves the bloc. A survey by industry group Ukie polled 75 of the more than 2,000 games firms in the UK, most of which worked in development. The government said it hoped to ""continue to attract"" global talent. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: ""The UK's creative industries are one of our biggest success stories, and we want to make sure the UK remains a world leader in video games production. ""As the prime minister made clear, we will continue to attract the brightest and best global talent. And we will continue to work with our creative industries to help seize the exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world."" It is currently conducting a review of the creative industries. Ukie said this week it wanted to work with the government to ""shape a favourable post-EU landscape for our world-leading games and interactive entertainment businesses"". Sales of UK games hit £2.96bn last year - more than from either video or music. 'Diverse talent' Ukie carried out extensive consultations between September and February and found the main concern about Brexit for companies was losing access to skilled workers, with more than 57% saying they employed staff from the European Union. Some 98% of respondents said EU nationals with the right skills should have a ""blanket right"" to both live and work in the UK in the future. ""In very competitive, innovative global industries, like games, if UK businesses cannot attract the diverse talent they want and need, some firms are likely to relocate, taking jobs and economic opportunities with them,"" Ukie said. Others said divergences with EU laws around data could also pose a risk after Brexit. A total of 63% said the cost of separating the data they hold on UK customers could impose ""significant costs"", with one firm saying it may stop publishing games in the UK as a result. There were also concerns that Brexit could leave UK companies unable to access funding from EU programmes such as Creative Europe - although Ukie said Brexit also offered an opportunity to improve public subsidies for the industry. More than 60% of games companies forecast growth in their businesses this year, down from 80% in 2016.",Some 40% of British gaming companies say they are considering relocating some or all of their business because of Brexit.
"By Angus CrawfordBBC News The chairman of the Commons media committee, Damian Collins, said he had ""grave doubts"" about the effectiveness of its content moderation systems. Mr Collins' comments come after the BBC reported dozens of photos to Facebook, but more than 80% were not removed. They included images from groups where users were discussing swapping what appeared to be child abuse material. When provided with examples of the images, Facebook reported the BBC journalists involved to the police and cancelled plans for an interview. It subsequently issued a statement: ""It is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation."" Mr Collins said it was extraordinary that the BBC had been reported to the authorities when it was trying to ""help clean up the network"". On its welcome page, Facebook says it does remove obscene material. ""Nudity or other sexually suggestive content"" it states are not allowed on the platform. It encourages users to report inappropriate content via its ""report button"". The US firm says it has improved this system since an investigation by the BBC last year. That found ""secret"" groups were being used by paedophiles to meet and swap images. Information the BBC provided to the police led to one man being sent to prison for four years. To test Facebook's claim, the BBC used the report button to alert the company to 100 images which appeared to break its guidelines. They included: Of the 100 images only 18 were removed. According to Facebook's automated replies, the other 82 did not breach ""community standards"". They included the apparent freeze frame. Facebook's rules forbid convicted sex offenders from having accounts. But the BBC found five convicted paedophiles with profiles, and reported them to Facebook via its own system. None of them were taken down. ""I find it very disturbing, I find that content unacceptable,"" said Mr Collins in response. ""I think it raises the question of how can users make effective complaints to Facebook about content that is disturbing, shouldn't be on the site, and have confidence that that will be acted upon."" The BBC also showed what it had found to Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England. ""I have been very disturbed by what I have seen, very disappointed that one year on we are still seeing images that are very sexualised, totally in my view unacceptable,"" she said. ""The moderation clearly isn't being effective, I would question whether humans are moderating this, are looking at this, and also I think it is failing to take account of the context of these images."" The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) also voiced concern. ""Facebook's failure to remove illegal content from its website is appalling and violates the agreements they have in place to protect children,"" said a spokeswoman. ""It also raises the question of what content they consider to be inappropriate and dangerous to children."" The BBC first asked Facebook for an interview about its moderation system in late-2015, and repeated the request following this follow-up investigation. The social network's director of policy Simon Milner agreed to be interviewed last week, on condition the BBC provided examples of the material that it had reported, but had not been removed by moderators. The BBC did so, but was reported to the UK's National Crime Agency as a consequence. Mr Collins said this was ""extraordinary - because you're trying to help them clean up their network, from material that shouldn't be there"". Facebook later provided a statement. ""We have carefully reviewed the content referred to us and have now removed all items that were illegal or against our standards,"" it said. ""This content is no longer on our platform. We take this matter extremely seriously and we continue to improve our reporting and take-down measures. ""It is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation. ""When the BBC sent us such images we followed our industry's standard practice and reported them to Ceop [Child Exploitation & Online Protection Centre]. ""We also reported the child exploitation images that had been shared on our own platform. This matter is now in the hands of the authorities."" But the BBC's director of editorial policy, David Jordan, said the move was surprising. ""The fact that Facebook sent images that had been sent to them, that appear on their site, for their response about how Facebook deals with inappropriate images…the fact that they sent those on to the police seemed to me to be extraordinary,"" he said. ""One can only assume that the Facebook executives were unwilling or certainly reluctant to engage in an interview or a debate about why these images are available on the Facebook site."" A spokesman for the National Crime Agency said he could not confirm or deny an investigation was underway.",Facebook has been criticised for its handling of reports about sexualised images of children on its platform.
"The search firm will now only share user information if the site wanting access provides reciprocal data feeds to others. The policy switch was primarily aimed at Facebook, said Google, complaining that the social network left users in a ""data dead end"". Google said the policy switch would be implemented over the next few weeks. Like many other web firms, Google lets others get at the data it holds on users of its many services via what is known as an Application Programming Interface (API). Before the policy switch sites such as Facebook used Google's API to let their users automatically import GMail contacts so they could rapidly fill out their profile and find others that use the service. Now Google will only give automatic access to GMail contacts to those sites and services that let others mine the data they hold. In a statement shared with the Reuters newswire, Google singled out Facebook for criticism. ""We have decided to change our approach slightly to reflect the fact that users often aren't aware that once they have imported their contacts into sites like Facebook, they are effectively trapped,"" said Google. Facebook has yet to comment on the row. Gartner analyst Ray Valdes told Reuters that Google's decision is tied into its business ambitions. ""Google needs to evolve to become a big player in the social Web and it hasn't been able to do that,"" he said. Analysts also suspect that Google's decision is related to the deal struck between Facebook and Microsoft that allows user data to power the Bing search engine. Although Google has stopped the automatic siphoning of GMail data it is still possible for users to download their contacts and then can be shared with any web service.","GMail contacts will no longer be automatically handed over to other websites and services, says Google."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Virtual Private Networks are often used to skirt censorship and surveillance in countries with tight restrictions on internet use. The company has been heavily criticised for removing several VPN apps, and was accused of “aiding Chinese censorship efforts”. Apple said it disagreed with China’s position but had to comply with the country’s laws. ""We would obviously rather not remove the apps,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said on Tuesday. ""But like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business. Mr Cook said comparisons to a legal battle in the US last year - in which the firm refused to help the FBI unlock a dead terrorist's iPhone - were unfair. ""They’re very different,” he said. ""In the case of the US, the law in the US supported us. I was very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. Like we would if the US changed the law here, we’d have to abide by them in both cases."" 'Most drastic measure' Activists and indeed regular citizens in China have been finding ways to poke holes in the country’s infamous Great Firewall of China which blocks “questionable” content and is heavily monitored. To operate a VPN service in the country, companies must be authorised by the Chinese authorities. Apple sales boosted by services growth Those without permission, such as ExpressVPN, have been singled out for removal from Apple’s App Store. “We’re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date,” said ExpressVPN in a blog post. “We are troubled to see Apple aiding China’s censorship efforts. ExpressVPN strongly condemns these measures, which threaten free speech and civil liberties.” Mr Cook said Apple stated its opposition to the removal through the “appropriate” channels. ""We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree,” he said. ""In this particular case, we are hopeful that over time the [restrictions] we’re seeing are loosened, because innovation requires freedom to collaborate and communicate.” Mr Cook’s remarks were made during the firm’s quarterly earnings call.

"According to a report from the Reuters news agency, BAE made the discovery after investigating the theft of $81 million (£56m) from the Bangladesh central bank in February. Swift has released a software update to assist customers with security. The group said its network and core messaging services were not affected. BAE has published a blog on its findings. The hackers were discovered - thanks to a spelling mistake in one transfer order - before they could transfer $1bn (£690m) as they had planned. A cheap internet router with no firewall has been blamed for the thieves being able to gain access to the Bangladesh bank's computers. Using this access, the thieves allegedly transferred funds from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York into other bank accounts. Now, BAE says it believes part of the hack involved gaining access to the Bangladesh central bank's Swift payment system. Transfer tool Swift, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is used by 11,000 banks and other institutions. In its blog, BAE described some of the features of tools that it believes were used during the attack on the Bangladesh central bank. The blog adds: ""This malware appears to be just part of a wider attack toolkit and would have been used to cover the attackers' tracks as they sent forged payment instructions to make the transfers."" Such an approach would target Swift's Alliance Access software specifically. In a statement, Swift said: ""This malware has no impact on Swift's network or core messaging services. ""We understand that the malware is designed to hide the traces of fraudulent payments from customers' local database applications and can only be installed on users' local systems by attackers that have successfully identified and exploited weaknesses in their local security."" Natasha Deteran, a spokeswoman for Swift, told Reuters the software update was intended ""to assist customers in enhancing their security and to spot inconsistencies in their local database records"".","British defence contractor BAE Systems has claimed bank hackers in Bangladesh targeted software from Swift, a key part of the global financial system."
"By Dougal ShawTechnology reporter As it twists its way up the building, two humans cower inside, but start to slide helplessly as the structure snaps in half. Objects fly across view as an army of remorseless robots bear down on our hero, intent on destruction. It is scenes such as these in Transformers 3 that make Scott Farrar chuckle like a child and conclude, ""wow, that really is cool"". And it is this hyper-real movie magic that has made the Oscar-winner one of the most sought after visual effects supervisors in Hollywood. Credits in his CV include Return of the Jedi, Back to the Future 2 and 3, Cocoon, Jurassic Park, Minority Report and The Chronicles of Narnia. Just ahead of the DVD release of Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon, he took time out to discuss his craft and how it continues to shape Hollywood. Transformers 3 ""I'm really proud that people get puzzled by what they are looking at,"" says Scott Farrar with a grin. ""They are confounded, they think it must be a puppet because CGI [computer-generated imagery] always looks fake."" The latest Transformers film is his third collaboration with director Michael Bay. Once again it offers a tour de force of special effects, even if the critics were less kind about the movie's storyline. The franchise, based on the hugely popular 1980s children's Transformer Toys, has become synonymous with the quest for ever more jaw-dropping images. But it is not only Transformers 3's show-stopping moments that Mr Farrar is proud of and eager to talk about. He also highlights the robots' ability to display feelings, which he believes has evolved as the series progressed. ""We've got better at nuance and emotion, and learned that animated characters have to act too,"" says Mr Farrar. ""We don't use motion capture a lot any more, putting tracking markers on the face."" The trick to helping characters like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee seem alive is, in fact, to add more graphics. ""We found that by adding more metal around the mouth, we could display emotion."" Mr Farrar says he thinks of his robot characters as ""silent movie actors, like Charlie Chaplin types"". He knows he has a successful scene in the can when he feels himself empathise with one of his creations during the film's quieter moments - however many times he has seen the footage. Trust The Transformers films also bear witness to director Michael Bay's conversion to the power of the computer animation technology offered by Mr Farrar's team. ""Michael didn't trust computer graphics very much when I first met him,"" says Mr Farrar. ""He always wanted to shoot everything as real as possible, including as many miniatures as possible."" ""He now realises what the technology can do for him, and for the narrative of the film."" The director gained so much confidence in his special effects team that he let them pitch ideas, and the best were ""plugged into the movie"", Mr Farrar says. Evolving role Like many film-makers of his generation, Mr Farrar's creative journey began with the humble Kodak Brownie camera. ""I begged my parents to use the Brownie wind-up, to shoot vacation photos, and make models in the backyard,"" he says. ""You experiment, and nobody is telling you what to do."" Mr Farrar was able to practice basic stop motion techniques as well as practising stunt scenes with friends. Over the years since turning his hobby into a career, Mr Farrar has noticed the role of visual effects supervisor has gained prestige, changing the dynamic with the director. ""There used to be a time when you would slink in and slink out."" ""You would do your bit and not intrude with the rest of the show because you only had 20 shots in the movie."" ""Now you have hundreds or thousands of shots in the movie."" As special effects advance there is a risk that they can end up dominating a film at the cost of its narrative. But Mr Farrar says that his craft cannot be blamed. ""It's like in the Renaissance, people all had brushes and paint and canvases, but there were some that really figured it out, really practised and learned to look at the world and bring dark and light onto the canvas."" ""So it's your perception - not just the tools"". Another dimension Transformers 3 is in effect ""3D-ready"". A three-dimensional version of the film was recorded alongside the traditional footage, and will be released in 2012. While filming parallel versions may be becoming more common, there is still debate about whether older films should be altered - including Star Wars. Scott Farrar is a living link between George Lucas's Star Wars' prequels and sequels. He worked on the effects for both Return of the Jedi, and the first prequel, The Phantom Menace. When asked if he minds that his work on the Star Wars films is being tweaked for the 3D re-releases, Mr Farrar's answer is direct and simple. ""Why not?"" He says he believes 3D ""really works on certain films"", depending on how the director shot them. And the ""incredible depth"" which Mr Lucas built into his shots, allowing the audience to ""feel the depth"", makes them ideal for the treatment. Mr Farrar recalls seeing a 3D ""test"" version of the first Star Wars film. ""When the destroyer comes in, it was great,"" he says. New techniques for transferring old stock to 3D makes the transition more compelling, he argues. ""You are no longer talking about 3D that is projected onto film,"" Mr Farrar says. ""It was somewhat disconcerting to see film in 3D where it bounced around the gate all the time. It was fatiguing frankly. ""Now if you have a digital projector, you can take an old film and you can steady it. And you can now project it so it is rock steady. It really works on certain films."" In the freedom of childhood with his budget equipment, Mr Farrar gained a quality that remains on display. ""I learned the excitement,"" he declares with passion. ""You're always using film tricks when you are using a camera, and doing visual effects is just expanding your bag of tricks."" From his backyard to cinemas worldwide, Mr Farrar's tricks are now beguiling millions.","A giant metallic worm-like creature wraps its tentacles around a Chicago skyscraper, punching out windows like a pneumatic drill."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor When the programme is broadcast, viewers will be prompted to switch to the higher quality streamed version by pressing the red button. US video platforms including Disney+, Netflix, Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video commonly offer content in this format. But it is more rare on the BBC and Sky. To take advantage of the facility, households will need a compatible TV and a relatively fast internet connection. The BBC recommends a minimum 24 megabits per second (Mbps) connection. By contrast, regular 1080p high definition (HD) programmes require a 6.3Mbps connection, and standard definition (SD) content 1.1Mbps. More vivid Ultra-High Definition (UHD) - the other name given to 4K on TVs - delivers four times as many pixels as HD video. The benefits are that images can appear sharper and more detailed, although this is not always apparent if the screen is not large enough or viewers are sitting too far away. For many people it is HDR that delivers the most notable difference. Pictures typically appear to be more vivid and colourful. It takes advantage of the fact screens can go brighter and/or darker than they used to be able to, providing a greater dynamic range. As a result, the shadows of an image can be made less murky while the highlights - including sparks from special effects - can have more impact. The BBC first publicly tested 4K HDR on iPlayer in 2016 when it offered four minutes from its Planet Earth II series. It has subsequently offered a limited range of full-length programmes including Dynasties; His Dark Materials; and Dracula, as well as sport including Wimbledon and Fifa World Cup 2018 matches. But despite pioneering related technologies - such as developing the hybrid-log gamma format used to stream live action simultaneously in both HDR and normal TV - it has been resistant to deploy it widely. This had led to odd situations such as Peaky Blinders being offered in HDR on the UK's Netflix service but only Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) on iPlayer. The BBC is, however, also providing further shows in 4K HDR over the coming days including: A spokesman for the corporation added that there would be further content in the new year. ""Many factors are taken into account when we're deciding what content to make available in UHD,"" he said. ""We've made a range of drama, factual and natural history programmes available for iPlayer viewers to watch in UHD, as well as some of the biggest live events, and we'll continue to look at these as well as other areas as we explore UHD on iPlayer in the future."" The announcement comes a month after Sky announced it was boosting its library of 4K HDR movies for Christmas, including adding all the Harry Potter films in the format. However, at present it is limiting this to its Sky Q satellite service and not its Now TV streaming platform, which is still broadcast in 1080p.",The BBC is to screen Doctor Who's Christmas special in 4K resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) colour via iPlayer.
"But this Tuesday, Samsung Electronic's botched recall and re-release of the product cut about $17bn (£13.8bn) off its market value. The company's shares are still above the level they plunged to when it first announced, in September, that customers should return the initial batch of phones because of a spate of fires blamed on faulty batteries. But the South Korean markets have not yet reacted to the news that Samsung is killing off the Note 7 for good, following reports that several replacement units had also overheated. Below, four experts pick through some of the issues raised by the affair. Prof ManMohan Sodhi, Cass Business School: Was Samsung right to abandon the Note 7? As Oscar Wilde would have said, to have one product recall may be regarded as a misfortune, to have two looks like carelessness. The electronics industry faces an increasing amount of power being shrunk into vanishingly small circuits. These circuits get hot and, sometimes, catch fire. Competition means there is less time available to test products, and many companies have had misfortunes. But Samsung offered a false alternative too quickly. That is carelessness. To fight this image, Samsung has announced a permanent stop to the production of the Note 7, following a temporary stop earlier. This gives it room to redesign a brand new product. But this will only add to Samsung's woes. It will be viewed as panic in the boardroom. A full recall of existing Notes as well as those yet unsold will be an environmental nightmare besides being economically challenging to the entire supply chain - despite the fact that the vast majority of these phones would have remained in full working order for their working lives. No, like Volkswagen and its diesel emissions scandal, Samsung should have stuck it out with the Note 7 until the Note 8 became available. It still has to identify and publicise what caused the phones to overheat if it is to recover its reputation. And it could have offered free stress tests and compensation vouchers to Note 7 owners, and have convinced the airlines the vetted handsets were safe. The engineers could have handled the technology problem - panicking was not the solution. Ian Fogg, IHS: Which rival is best poised to take advantage? Samsung's competition has been caught by surprise by the Note 7 failure. Most smartphone makers had chosen not to launch large screen smartphone models - 5.5in (14cm) and above - at this time of year, because they would go head to head with the Note and latest iPhones. As a result, they are poorly placed to benefit. Google's new premium Pixel smartphones might seem to be arriving at an ideal time. But IHS estimates that Pixel production is under one quarter of Samsung's original planned Note 7 volume, which limits Google's ability to replace the Note's market position. Additionally, Google's mobile operator exclusives - EE in the UK, Verizon in the US, Telstra in Australia - mean many of those who had intended to use the Note 7 on other networks might not switch. Other Android handset manufacturers have a few phablet smartphones in the works. In the US, LG is launching the V20, but it also has low planned production volumes and extremely limited availability in Europe. Huawei may choose to accelerate the launch of its next Mate smartphone, but its P9 flagship has a modest 5.2in display much smaller than the Note 7's 5.7in screen. Sony, HTC, and ZTE have no recent large screen premium smartphone to offer. Samsung will seek to counter its rivals by marketing the S7 and S7 Edge, most likely by reviving its Gear VR virtual reality headset bundles, but the degree of success it enjoys will depend on the extent of damage to its brand. I expect Apple to raise iPhone 7 production significantly to meet increased demand, especially of the larger Plus model. The Note 7 recall will be an excellent market test of the strength of Apple's appeal to Android owners. But in the longer term, Huawei will be the biggest beneficiary. The Chinese company is already performing strongly, has moved into a clear third position in global smartphone shipments - behind Apple and Samsung - and aims to be number one. If Samsung's main brand is damaged - and not just its Note family - then Huawei will look to pick up sales right across its Android smartphone portfolio. Prof Will Stewart, The Institution of Engineering and Technology: Are smartphone batteries being put under too much pressure? Engineers have done a great job of dramatically reducing the energy needed to do any particular job on a smartphone - and the UK has been a real contributor to this - but we have used up this advantage by getting our handsets to do more things faster and better. So, the energy a phone needs to carry with it is still considerable. Thus, the potential exists for a fire if the energy is released in an uncontrolled way. Things have not really got worse in the past few years, but they have not got better either. At this point, it is not clear why Samsung is having problems with batteries from more than one supplier. It has been suggested they are being put under too much physical pressure - a result of our desire for phones to be as compact as possible. But clearly other compact phones have been fine. The energy involved is considerable but much less than that in the fuel or battery in your car, for example - indeed no more than the energy I have used cycling round London today. Lithium is a wonderful battery material and holds more energy for a given weight than any alternative. Only hydrogen is lighter, but as a gas, it is awkward to carry. So, lithium will continue to be the key battery material. Batteries will improve in various respects, with the application of nanotech for example. But as long as the energy is there, the potential hazard is there too. James P Rooney, vice-chairman of Seoul Financial Forum: Do Samsung's troubles pose risks to the wider South Korean economy? Because of incorrect statistical analysis, outside observers have long had a significant tendency to massively overstate the importance of Korea's top 30 ""chaebol"" conglomerates, of which Samsung is the largest. The most recent data from Samsung Group itself showed its self-estimated contribution to Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) was about 2.5%, and that number probably remains true today. So, any impact from Note 7 in this current year could be only a very small fraction of that number. An impact of 0.1% of GDP, which is frankly insignificant at the national level, would probably be an overstatement. Furthermore, since most of the labour-intensive final assembly is handled at factories outside of Korea, any enforced idleness in those plants is not Korea's problem directly. But any kind of product defect and product recall naturally has an effect on reputation and brand image, both for Samsung and for Korea, as most people view them both as being so intertwined. This is potentially where the greatest impact will be felt, but it can work both ways - the dark cloud or the silver lining that comes with it. If the new generation of Samsung leadership converts the real value of this debacle into a constructive lesson in quality and careful design and testing, then it will come out of it stronger and better equipped to continue being successful in the future. I believe Samsung has handled this need for prompt action well so far. If it continues to do so, then it can expect to earn the respect of its customers, its investors, its regulators - and in all likelihood its competitors too, all of whom can only be happy that this did not happen to them first. Korea today makes many excellent and world-class products that are welcome everywhere. By facing these problems head-on rather than trying to skirt around them or brush them under the rug, everybody gets stronger and reputations grow rather than shrink. Let us hope that is what is happening here.","Not so long ago, the Galaxy Note 7 was being hailed as the world's finest smartphone."
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley Instead, Google announced a pilot programme aimed at people who ""live on the web"". Chrome OS is Google's boldest bid yet to challenge Microsoft's market dominance with Windows software. Google has already gone after Microsoft's Office software with its Google Docs product. Chrome marks a departure from traditional operating systems, such as Mac OSX and Windows, by targeting users who spend most of their time on the web. ""We think cloud computing will define computing as we know it,"" said Eric Schmidt, Google's chief executive officer. ""Finally there is a viable third choice for an operating system."" Google's Sundar Pichai said the pilot scheme is aimed at early adopters, developers and users who are used to using beta software. They will be given an unbranded black notebook, called the Cr-48. Mr Pichai said there would be no devices on sale until next year simply because the software was not ready for prime time, due to a number of bugs and unfinished features. ""This is a profound shift,"" said Mr Pichai, claiming that the operating system is Google's attempt to ""re-think the personal experience for the modern web"". ""Chrome is nothing but the web,"" he added. Machines for the pilot scheme will start shipping soon. Consumer devices from Acer and Samsung are due on the market in 2011. No pricing details were given. Computer share At the press event in San Francisco, Google also outlined a number of features in Chrome OS. Security was at its heart, with automatic updates for users taking away the need to constantly ensure that the latest version has been activated. The company said that it hoped to be the first to ship a tool called ""verified boot"" on Chrome OS devices, which makes sure nothing on the machine has been modified or compromised. ""We are confident that when we ship Chrome notebooks, it will be the most secure OS ever shipped to users,"" said Mr Pichai. He also said that because data will be accessed through the cloud, users could loan their machines to other people. ""By delivering nothing but the web, it makes it very easy to share your computer,"" said Mr Pichai. Google said it has also partnered with US telecom titan Verizon to offer connectivity with Chrome notebooks when they go on sale. The plans range from 100 MB of free data, to $9.99 a day for unlimited data, with no extra fees. Two paths A number of analysts have questioned whether or not Google is making a smart play with the Chrome OS, given that the computing world has changed dramatically since it announced plans for the low-cost operating system over 18 months ago. In the last year, Apple's iPad has reinvigorated the tablet market, and Google's own Android OS - which powers smartphones - has taken off. Android is also being used in tablet devices and netbooks, prompting a number of industry watchers to question Google's twin approach in the OS market. ""Google hasn't done a good job on why these two things need to exist,"" Michael Gartenberg, director with research firm Gartner, told the BBC last week. ""Android is designed for the here and now, an app centred world. The hottest devices don't have keyboards. Google has to come up with a better story of how Chrome fits in,"" he added. Many fear two Google operating systems will cause confusion for consumers. Google's Mr Schmidt does not believe it will, and recently stated that Chrome was for keyboards and Android was for touch-based devices. The Chrome OS will be given free to hardware manufacturers. Microsoft, in comparison, charges a fee for its Windows software. Back in October, the software leader said Windows sales increased by 66% on a year earlier, to $4.8bn, helping to boost first quarter profits.","Google has delayed the launch of its much anticipated laptop, powered by its Chrome operating system, until 2011."
"Mr Zuckerberg said he asked the actor, who was chosen by the public, after an awards ceremony earlier this month. The Facebook co-founder coded the AI assistant - called Jarvis, after the butler in Iron Man - for his home. If he decides to release it to the public, people would relate differently to a famous voice than more robotic sounding assistants, tech experts said. Mr Zuckerberg asked his Facebook followers to pick the voice after building artificial intelligence to help him around the house. He told tech news site Fast Company that he called Mr Freeman after the actor presented the Breakthrough Awards, a science prize co-founded by Mr Zuckerberg. ""I said, 'Hey, I posted this thing, and... thousands of people want you to be the voice. Will you do it?'"" Mr Freeman's answer was ""yeah, sure"", he added. Robert Downey Jr, who plays Iron Man, had offered to voice Jarvis, while Arnold Schwarzenegger features as an alternative, disciplinarian voice in jokey videos released by Mr Zuckerberg this week. Experts in human-computer interaction said Morgan Freeman, whose roles have included God in Evan Almighty and the narrator in March of the Penguins, would distinguish Jarvis from existing AI assistants. Celebrity voices add to the ""novelty effect"" and might make it more enjoyable to interact with an AI assistant, said Dr Simone Stumpf, a senior lecturer at City University in London. ""If a user is more engaged, then they might also be forgiving of mistakes, interact more - and thus provide more training data for the AI to get it right - and are less likely to abandon it,"" she told the BBC. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google Home are bringing smart assistants into the mainstream. Morgan Freeman would be a different offering because he is more of a ""grandfather figure"" than a friend, said Dr Bernie Hogan of the Oxford Internet Institute. ""We do know people project emotions on to their computers,"" he said. ""We've been anthropomorphising these things for years."" Research indicates it is often the attitude of AI, rather than the voice, which annoys people, said Yorick Wilks, professor of Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University. ""It may just be the user needs to choose voice, as they can now with Sat-nav, and also the personality of assistant or change it at different times,"" he said. AI companies have also faced criticism for favouring female voices for the assistants. ""The 'gender' of AI assistants has had its recent controversies, with some accusations of sexism aimed at companies who have chosen female voices, particularly where perceptions of their subservience or even sexual undertones may exist,"" said Dr Rich Picking of Glyndwr University. Still, it could be a while before users are interacting with the dulcet tones of Mr Freeman in their homes.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News TV signals use different parts of the radio spectrum to radar, but both bounce off solid objects. Using special receivers, researchers said they were able to track up to 30 planes simultaneously flying at altitudes of up to 10,000ft (3km). But they say more work has to be done. ""Questions around resilience and service standards need to be answered and we'd need to explore formal agreements with the broadcasters, but this is very exciting and we'll be looking to further develop the concept over the next five years,"" said Nats engineer Nick Young. Interference resistant The study involved a TV signal broadcast by a transmitter at Crystal Palace in London. Three specialist receivers were used to measure the directions of the signals that reflected off the aircraft and the differences in time they took to be received compared to the rest of the unimpeded TV signal. This ""triangulated"" information was then used to deduce the various planes' locations. A follow-up trial in Liverpool suggested that the TV signal-based system experienced less interference from wind turbines than traditional radar receivers. ""As the blades rotate they can enter a velocity range that the radar is looking for,"" explained Mr Young. A typical wind farm can contain 30 turbines moving at 300m (984ft) per second which is aircraft speed, he added. ""The radar detects it and may think it's an aircraft,"" he said. ""It can exhibit strange behaviour. But there's a suggestion that using this type of [TV signal] 'radar' might overcome these issues."" Cost cutting Using TV signals instead could save money and free up valuable radio spectrum for other uses, Mr Young added ""Radar is big and expensive, it's an effort to procure and maintain. ""You could almost put this on a phone mast and distribute the signal over a wide area - plus you've got third parties [broadcasters] already transmitting it."" The research was been carried out in conjunction with the defence firm Thales UK and the R&D lab Roke Manor over the past two years. But the idea behind the project is far from new. In 1935, radar pioneer Sir Robert Watson-Watt successfully bounced a radio wave from a BBC short-wave transmitter off a Heyford bomber, indicating the technology worked. ""Increased computer processing power has made this easier,"" said Mr Young. ""It's only in the last five or 10 years that we have entered a stage where we can process enough information to make it viable. ""There are a number of technical and regulatory hurdles to overcome before this could be considered for operational use,"" he added.","Research carried out by the air traffic control provider Nats and its partners suggests that existing TV signals could be used to track aircraft, providing a cheaper alternative to radar."
"By Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter, BBC News It comes days after Twitter banned thousands of QAnon-related accounts. QAnon is a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theory whose followers support US President Donald Trump. They believe the president is battling a clandestine ""deep state"" network of political, business and media elites. TikTok said it moved to restrict ""QAnonTruth"" searches after a question from the BBC's anti-disinformation unit, which noticed a spike in conspiracy videos using the tag. The company expressed concern that such misinformation could harm users and the general public. ""QAnon"" and related hashtags, such as ""Out of Shadows"", ''Fall Cabal"" and ""QAnonTruth"", will no longer return search results on TikTok - although videos using the same tags will remain on the platform. Videos using the ""QAnon"" hashtag, in particular, have millions of cumulative views and can still be found if a user's algorithm directs them to the associated content. Many videos promote unfounded conspiracy theories. Recently, some of them endorsed baseless claims linking furniture firm Wayfair to child trafficking. TikTok's intervention comes after Twitter announced measures earlier this week also aimed at cracking down on the QAnon conspiracy theorists, including banning thousands of accounts. It said the suspensions will be applied to accounts that are ""engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, co-ordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension"". Twitter also said it would stop recommending content linked to QAnon and block URLs associated with it from being shared on the platform, in an attempt to prevent ""offline harm"". Celebrities, including model Chrissy Teigen, have been victims of co-ordinated abuse from QAnon conspiracy theorists in recent weeks. Sources close to Facebook say the social media site is looking to take similar action over supporters of the conspiracy theory. QAnon groups on the site have hundreds of thousands of members accumulatively. What is QAnon? QAnon began in October 2017 on the anonymous message board 4chan. A user claimed to have top security clearance within the US government and signed off their posts as ""Q"" - hence the name QAnon. Q communicates in cryptic posts and claims to be directly involved in a secret investigation into a global network of child abusers. The total list of QAnon claims is enormous - and often contradictory. Most recently, QAnon conspiracy theorists have spread a number of unfounded conspiracy theories about coronavirus, ranging from claims about the pandemic being a ""hoax"" to outlandish suggestions about face masks and vaccines. The central theory about a malicious ""deep-state"" network of elites, followed on from the ""pizzagate"" saga in 2016 - a fake theory about Democratic Party politicians running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. Many QAnon influencers have big audiences on social media. They urge followers to ""do their own research"" - in other words, watch YouTube videos and talk to other supporters - to solve Q's puzzles. You might also be interested in watching:","TikTok has blocked a number of hashtags related to the QAnon conspiracy theory from appearing in search results, amid concern about misinformation, the BBC has learned."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter The survival of her company, which pledges to make the web a better place, is at the mercy of one of its main competitors, Google. If you haven't heard of Mozilla, you almost certainly know - and perhaps use - its most famous product: the Firefox browser. Since 2002, it has been steadily gaining market share against Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft's pre-loaded, oft-criticised equivalent. It now has about half a billion users, a huge number of which are evangelists for the software. Many even help create it - it is one of the largest open-source projects on the net. Google likes this. So much so, they pay Mozilla millions of pounds every year to secure a piece of prime real-estate on Firefox's default homepage encouraging users to perform a Google search. This investment is believed to represent about 85% of Mozilla's entire income. Mozilla loves that, no doubt, but can they trust it? ""If for whatever reason the Google deal wasn't renewed, it would be difficult,"" admits Ms Baker in an interview with the BBC. ""We have a good amount of retained earnings, and we manage it that way so that we would have a long period to adjust, but that's not the situation you want to be in."" Why would Google pull out or scale back its contribution? Well, unlike in the past, when Firefox was the only real competitor to IE, the browser war is now a three-horse race. For Google, with its highly popular Chrome browser, Mozilla has gone from being a partner, to one of its competitors. Beyond the browser In November last year, against a backdrop of uncertainty and worry, Google renewed its deal. The terms were not made public and, until we see Mozilla's next public accounts (due soon, they say), we won't know how much money Mozilla is currently earning. According to some measures, Chrome overtook Firefox's market share in January. If this trend continues - and there's little to suggest it won't - the value of the Google-Firefox deal will begin to sag. If Mozilla is to survive, it needs a new major revenue stream. ""We are not currently diversified, revenue wise,"" Ms Baker admits. ""With Firefox we have a sustainability model so we can pursue our public benefit goals effectively. ""It could be a good sustainability model for many years to come, but it's not good to rely on that. As we pursue these new initiatives, we do and will look for new ways to make them sustainable as well."" These new initiatives mean that Mozilla has been forced to look well beyond the browser. The internet is a very different place today than it was when the first Firefox - named Phoenix until a trademark wrangle - came onto the scene. Back then, about 90% of computer owners accessed the web using IE. It was - by Microsoft's own admission several years later - vulnerable to attack. ""We came out of a history of abuse,"" reflects Ms Baker. ""Firefox succeeded in part because of the abusive behaviour that came through IE - spyware, malware, ads. That's part of our history."" Is there still ""abuse"" on the internet? ""If you think about the architecture of the web, there's no real place that says 'I'm at the centre'. ""The world is doing more things on the internet today, and the browser is no longer adequate to build that kind of user control. ""The phrase I like to use is user sovereignty. I'm the human being. I should be in control. ""It should not be that I buy a machine and that something else is controlling it - because then I become the object."" 'Explosive innovation' In January Mozilla announced Pancake, billed as an effort to re-think the way we navigate and manage ourselves on the web. It offers, in Mozilla's words ""occasionally crazy ideas"", such as doing away with the URL system (or at least, hiding it from view) and, crucially, creating a cloud-based framework that allows us to carry and manage our personal data wherever we go. ""Think of it more as your dashboard,"" explains Ms Baker. ""We're not looking to become Facebook, or LinkedIn and all these other sites. We're not trying to displace those sites - we're trying to make a place where, for example, it could say: 'Application X wants this kind of data'."" She worries that our shift towards adopting mobile apps is fragmenting the control we have of our lives. The internet was meant to be connected, she says - not siloed. ""We really do want to encourage developers to develop across devices, using the same kind of power and explosive innovation and freedoms that the web has given us over the last 15 years."" Ms Baker knows that if projects like Pancake are likely to succeed, they will need not just developer backing, but the same mass-market adoption that made Firefox such a success. But for a company that has dined out on a single, highly-monetisable project, such a dramatic change of direction could prove difficult. ""We've always been more than Firefox, but we haven't talked about it that much,"" Ms Baker says. Goodwill Fortunately for Mozilla, it is free to develop a good idea first, and worry about the money later. ""The reason for the other initiatives is not driven by revenue,"" Ms Baker says. ""It is driven because we cannot fulfil the Mozilla mission unless we have a presence in these other spaces. ""Our stakeholders - we don't have shareholders - are not looking for a financial return on investment. The return on their time and energy and goodwill that they're looking for is the product that they like, and an internet that has a layer of user sovereignty in it. ""Things like Pancake are really early. When we have an idea of 'wow this is really exciting', at that point you then say: 'Ok, we know what people love about it now - what are some sustainability ideas that we can try?'"" As for where those money-making models might emerge, Ms Baker is less forthcoming: ""I don't have much to say on that one."" The BBC asked Google about how it sees the future of the Mozilla deal. ""Mozilla has been a valuable partner to Google over the years,"" says Alan Eustace, senior vice-president of search. ""We look forward to continuing this great partnership in the years to come."" This bodes well. Indeed, to pull out of a company that exists in order to mobilise ""openness, innovation and opportunity on the internet"" might be squarely at odds with Google's mantra of ""don't be evil"". However, if Chrome continues to grow, that partnership may not be as lucrative as it has been to date. But while users may be flocking in their droves to Chrome, they'd be wise to remember that some of the couldn't-imagine-a-world-without features of the modern browser are largely down to the volunteer minds behind the Mozilla project. Equally important, argues open web campaigner and co-editor of BoingBoing.net Cory Doctorow, is Mozilla's place as a leading non-profit in the connected web. ""They can remain a kind of Switzerland of technology that really only has one raison d'etre, and that is to make the internet better,"" he told the BBC. ""When you look at the early days of Mozilla, it was all about acting as an honest broker for users. ""That remains the role that Mozilla has to play because they are an independent third-party that doesn't have a commercial dog in the fight.""",Mozilla Foundation president Mitchell Baker is sitting on a ticking time bomb.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The debate was organised by the government, which is keen to see the principles of a free and equal net maintained. ISPs are increasingly looking to prioritise some traffic on their networks and block some. After the meeting the BBC called for the creation of a broadband content group to represent content providers. It, along with content providers such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Skype, is growing increasingly concerned about how the issue of net neutrality is being dealt with. Net neutrality - the principle that all net traffic should be treated equally - has been challenged in recent years as ISPs look to make a return on their increasingly expensive networks. They argue that if content providers want to pay to get their traffic prioritised on the network, then they should be allowed to do so. But some content owners and digital activists such as Open Rights Group argue that such a policy would do long-term damage to the internet, which was always conceived as a platform for everyone - not just those with deep pockets. Net neutrality has been a key issue in Europe and a raft of legislation comes into force in May which will force ISPs to be more open about how they manage the traffic on their networks. Free net After the debate, Ed Vaizey, communications minister, made his views clear. ""Internet traffic is growing,"" he said. ""Handling that heavier traffic will become an increasingly significant issue so it was important to discuss how to ensure the internet remains an open, innovative and competitive place. Commenting about a code of practice drawn up by the Broadband Stakeholders' Group earlier in the week, he said the agreement should be guided by three principles. ""The first is users should be able to access all legal content,"" he said. ""Second, there should be no discrimination against content providers on the basis of commercial rivalry and finally traffic management policies should be clear and transparent."" While Mr Vaizey is reluctant to regulate the industry, he has appointed world wide web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee to bang heads together. But he could struggle to persuade ISPs that all the traffic on their networks should be treated equally. Jim Killock, director of the ORG, said ISPs were in no mood for compromise at the debate. ""They weren't willing to make any concessions on their ability to manage traffic,"" he said. ""BT even said that if people want to block things they should be able to."" ""If people are blocking large sections of the internet and promoting a handful of service then they shouldn't be able to claim that they sell internet access,"" he added. Enhanced service A spokesman for ISPA, the body that represents UK internet service providers told the BBC that ISPs ""should be free to manage their networks as they see fit"". He added that it would make no sense to throttle popular services such as the iPlayer. ""That is just going to annoy your customers and they will leave,"" he said. The code of practice drawn up by the BSG this week is aimed at making it easier for consumers to see how traffic is managed on different networks. The ORG argues that it should go further ""In some countries, such as Norway, ISPs have said that they will only do traffic management to deal with congestion"" said Mr Killock. ""But the UK code allows ISPs to prioritise and discriminate as they like as long as they are transparent."" Simon Milner, head of policy at BT, said the ISP had no intention of blocking anything other than illegal traffic, but he defended the right of others to do so. ""In our view if someone wants to offer a service in which things are blocked - for example the Church of England might want to deliver Christian-friendly broadband - then they should be allowed to do that. It is no different from the walled gardens we used to have,"" he said. And in the ""multi-channelled"" internet of the future, he said, firms should be allowed to prioritise certain traffic. ""If someone came to us - for example a Russian TV mogul - and wanted enhanced delivery, then that shouldn't be regulated against. It wouldn't mean that other content would be of low quality,"" he said. But, he added, so far ""content providers aren't beating down our door"" for such a service. Traffic lights The BBC has always maintained that it won't pay to have its popular iPlayer service prioritised over other traffic. John Tate, the BBC's director of policy and strategy said: ""People should be able to access the internet without the blocking or throttling of certain content due to commercial rivalry."" The BBC is currently developing a traffic-light system to let users see how different ISPs treat its iPlayer service. The details of the system, due for release in the spring, are not fully decided but it is likely ISPs will be rated simply: Red for poor, amber for OK, and green for acceptable. The debate also looked at how mobile operators are managing traffic as more people access the web via mobile devices. Traffic management in mobile is already routine, said Mr Killock. ""The levels of blocking on phones is enormous,"" he said. ""Most phones block peer-to-peer traffic while most degrade the quality of Skype calls because they don't want Skype to be taking revenue away from them.""","ISPs have defended their right to operate a two-speed internet, at a key debate into the future of the web."
"In total, 77 firms were added to the list - most of them Chinese. The Entity List is drawn up by the US Department of Commerce, and already includes more than 275 China-based firms, including telecoms giant Huawei. The move is seen as a defiant final strike by the outgoing US president, Donald Trump, who has taken a hard line on China. The US administration said that it had imposed export controls on SMIC to restrict its access to US technology because of alleged ties to the Chinese military. ""We're adding SMIC to the Entity List mostly because we need to make sure US intellectual property and manufacturing capabilities are not being used by SMIC's clients to continue to support the military-civil fusion efforts within China,"" a senior official in the US Commerce Department said. The official added that the US had evidence SMIC had worked with the Chinese military on short and medium-range ballistic missiles, and exoskeletons for soldiers. SMIC was founded in 2000, and has since become the most prominent chipmaker in mainland China. US companies will now have to seek a special licence from the Commerce Department before exporting goods to the firm, which will affect its ability to acquire materials for producing high-end chips. The US government also added DJI, one of the world's largest drone manufacturers, to the Entity List, stating that it believed the firm had played a role in human rights violations in China. The ban does not prevent people from buying DJI drones, but it means the firm will have restrictions placed on the transfer of any technologies from the US. Neither firm has so far commented on the US decision. The Chinese government has responded by introducing its own laws which restrict the export of military technologies. Trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies have been going on for several years, but have escalated in recent months. Consumer app TikTok, and digital firm Tencent - both Chinese - are also facing bans within the US.",Drone maker DJI and chipmaker SMIC are the latest Chinese firms to be added to a US trade blacklist.
"Several - including a Batman spin-off and a violent zombie-themed title - are designed to appeal to ""hardcore gamers"" who have traditionally opted for other games machines. The firm also revealed that the device would be able to support two of its touchscreen game pads at the same time. However, it did not set a launch date beyond referring to ""the holidays"". The period usually refers to the months of November and December in the US. The firm had previously said the machine would be released in Europe, Australia, the US and Japan before Christmas. Details of the console and controllers' costs were also not discussed at the presentation held at the E3 games trade show in Los Angeles. Serious gamers The Wii U will be the first of the next generation of games machines to launch. Sony and Microsoft have yet to reveal details of their plans. News that the titles - including Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition; Aliens: Colonial Marines; Mass Effect 3; Assassin's Creed 3 and ZombiU - are under development for Nintendo's machine may help extend its appeal. ""The criticism of the Wii U had been that it didn't address serious gamers who are looking for complex, graphics-heavy titles,"" said Bridget Carey, senior editor of the tech site Cnet. ""So they are coming out with all these titles. Many of them are already around on other consoles, so it's not going to wow many people. ""But this is Nintendo saying we're there for every type of gamer, not just family fun - which is their biggest strength."" Mario returns Announced titles targeting the casual gaming market included New Mario Bros U, Pikmin 3 and Scribblenauts Unlimited. Nintendo Land will also feature several of the firm's existing characters in mini-games and is intended to help introduce users to the concept of the new Wii U Game Pad controllers. The game pads feature a touchscreen which Nintendo claimed would help ""revolutionise"" gaming. Examples of its uses included allowing a player to check their inventory while the action continued on the main screen, setting off explosives by tapping on the appropriate part of the handset's image, and playing games on the small screen when other family members wanted to use the TV. Nintendo also promoted the integration of its Miiverse social network, allowing a user's friends to pass on tips or boast of their recent scores while play continued. Winter rush Nintendo's shares dropped last year after it first announced the Wii U, and in April it declared an annual net loss of 43.2bn yen ($533m; £329m). One analyst attending E3 said there were still unanswered questions that could determine if the firm would turn its fortunes around. ""They are really focusing on the game content, but the question is when these games and the console itself will be released,"" said Brian Blau, research director at the technology consultants Gartner. ""They need to come out some time in advance of Christmas to have an impact. If they come late in the buying cycle I'm slightly worried for their overall success."" The Engadget tech site highlighted another issue: the Game Pad can only be used wirelessly for 3 to 5 hours before its battery needs to be recharged, according to a specification sheet posted on Nintendo's site. That is significantly less than controllers without a touchscreen, such as Sony's Dual Shock 3 which lasts between 20 to 30 hours on a charge when new.",Nintendo has shown off 23 of the first games to be launched on its upcoming Wii U console.
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter In an open letter to the public, the Chinese telecoms company says it is ""as committed as ever"" to provide ""the best equipment"" to the UK's 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband providers. It comes amid a new security review that could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit. Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests. The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBC fears it could face reprisals in China, if the UK acts against Huawei. The Sunday Times also reported that China's ambassador to the UK had recently told business leaders that Beijing viewed the matter as ""a litmus test of whether Britain is a true and faithful partner"". Victor Zhang, vice president of Huawei and head of its UK operations, told the BBC the advertising campaign was about giving people the facts amid all the ""noise"" surrounding the company. He said he hoped the UK would take an ""evidence and fact-based approach"" and warned of huge economic impact if greater connectivity was delayed by the company's exclusion, potentially running into the tens of billions of pounds of lost productivity benefits. ""We need to work closely to address the issue, but we need to take action to accelerate the broadband deployment,"" he said. ""We don't have time to delay this."" Two decades Huawei's first significant global breakthrough came in the UK in 2005, when it signed a deal to upgrade BT's copper broadband service, five years after having entered the market. And 15 years later, the UK government's decision to allow Huawei a role in the country's 5G mobile networks represented another crucial victory. In January, ministers announced that Huawei's market share would be capped at 35%, and it would be excluded from sensitive locations, as well as the so-called ""core"" of the network, which is likened to the brains of the system. It appeared that the Chinese tech giant had avoided the outright ban that the US had been pressing for, on the grounds that the firm poses a national security risk. But a backbench rebellion by Conservative MPs in March and then the coronavirus crisis have heightened political pressure for the UK to be less dependent on China. And Washington's campaign has also not relented since January's decision, despite Huawei's repeated denials that it would ever compromise its clients. In May, the US placed significant new sanctions on the company, which limits its access to American computer chip technology. ""We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry,"" Mr Zhang told the BBC. ""We need to work out a solution."" Mr Zhang said that it was still too early for the company to draw any conclusion about the impact, and promised to share details of its own review when complete. However, the sanctions prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to carry out its own review. NCSC is expected to report in the coming weeks, and may say it has lost confidence it can manage the risks associated with Huawei being involved in 5G. That could open the way for the government to shift its position to further reducing, or even eventually eliminating Huawei's role. That could be costly to mobile operators, leading to higher bills for customers. It could also mean their rollout of 5G in the UK is slower. The advertising campaign also highlights Huawei's support of British universities and other institutions, which might also be affected, were the company to be blocked. ""We believe the UK will definitely review this based on the facts and the evidence, because the UK will take its own interests very seriously,"" Mr Zhang said. 'Trail of blood' The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday to have told staff in 2018 that the company was in a battle with the US and they should ""surge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood"". Asked about the language, Mr Zhang said it reflected a sense that Huawei was under intense attack from the United States. ""We are very vulnerable and we know America tried to attack Huawei with so called security reasons which are actually totally wrong,"" he said. ""It is simply because of trade and protectionism.""",Huawei is launching a newspaper and internet campaign to mark 20 years of business in the UK.
"It said the parties needed to address the ""innovation-stifling use of intellectual property"" which had led to several devices being banned from sale. It said innovations deemed essential to industry standards, such as 3G or Jpeg photos, would be the meeting's focus. It noted that if just one patent holder demanded unreasonable compensation the cost of a device could ""skyrocket"". Microsoft and Apple are among firms that have called on others not to enforce sales bans on the basis of such standards-essential patents. However, lawyers have noted that doing so would deprive other companies of way to counter-attacking other types of patent lawsuits pursued by the two companies. Fighting over Frand Companies are supposed to license standards-essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (Frand). That means that the patent-holder cannot discriminate who gets to use its invention and that the cost cannot be excessive. However, the International Telecommunication Union - the UN agency hosting the event - said that the parties involved differed over what they believed to be a reasonable charge for Frand-type patents, and whether they should be allowed to seek legal injunctions to block shipments if they failed to agree terms. ""We are seeing an unwelcome trend in today's marketplace to use standards-essential patents to block markets,"" said the ITU secretary general Dr Hamadoun Toure. ""There needs to be an urgent review of this situation: patents are meant to encourage innovation, not stifle it."" EU probes Motorola Mobility - now owned by Google - managed to impose a brief sales ban of iPhone and iPads in Germany last year after Apple refused to pay it a licence fee. The dispute centred on a patent deemed crucial to the GPRS data transmission standard used by GSM cellular networks . Motorola has also attempted to ban Xbox games consoles and Windows 7 software in Germany after Microsoft refused to pay it fees for a technology necessary to offer H.264 video coding and playback. Samsung has also attempted to use its 3G patents to bar Apple from selling products in Europe, Japan and the US. The efforts have led the EU to launch official investigations into both Motorola and Samsung's behaviour. 'No simple answer' However, industry watchers note that Apple has used lawsuits to ban Samsung products in both the US and Australia and attempted to restrict sales of other companies' devices powered by Android. Microsoft has also demanded and secured license fees from manufacturers making smartphones using Google's operating system. Illya Kazi, a member of the UK's Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys said competing interests would make it hard to resolve the matter. ""The situation is complex and it's very easy for someone to complain something is not fair because it is adverse to their position,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think there's a simple answer. High-level talks can't be a bad thing, but I would be surprised if they can come up with an agreed implementable conclusion."" The talks are scheduled to take place at the ITU's headquarters in Geneva on 10 October.",A rash of patent lawsuits has prompted the UN to call smartphone makers and others mobile industry bodies together.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter So what went wrong? The answer seems obvious - the iPhone arrived, and Blackberry was too slow to see what its impact would be. Mike Lazaridis was then co-CEO of Research in Motion - a slightly unlikely corporate set-up which worked very well for many years - and was asked in 2007 about the threat from Apple's phone: ""How much presence does Apple have in business? It's vanishingly small,"" was his reaction, and he was dismissive of the idea that anyone would want a phone without a keyboard. But he was far from alone in his complacency - there are plenty of quotes from Microsoft and Nokia executives who also failed to grasp the extent to which their world had changed. And those far-sighted Wall Street analysts also did not spot the impending apocalypse. After all, the peak in the shares came in the summer of 2008, 18 months after Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone. Even late in 2010, you can find references to a few analysts predicting an upturn, as Blackberry prepared to launch its tablet, the Playbook. Back then, with the ""crackberry"" still by far the favourite tool of corporate road warriors from New York to New Delhi, the company and its supporters could have been forgiven for being fairly relaxed. After all, iPhones and Androids might be catching the eye of flighty consumers, but businesses were not going to change from their secure and reliable if slightly dull Blackberries in a hurry. But there was another revolution sweeping through the corporate world, with a rather unlikely battle-cry, BYOD - Bring Your Own Device. The IT managers in companies had been used to dictating to their staff exactly which computers and mobile phones they would use - and how they would use them. But people who had grown used to a more exciting mobile internet experience than a locked-down Blackberry with no apps could provide. They demanded change and choice - and the corporate IT managers were forced to submit. Blackberry began to see its grip loosened in the law firms, the government offices and even the Wall Street banks where it once reigned supreme. Yes, there was a brief period when it was the phone of choice amongst young Britons, but that was never going to be a profitable business. It is easy with hindsight to see where things went wrong, much harder to say what Blackberry could have done about it. After all, Blackberry's customers loved its products and most were adamant that they wanted a physical keyboard, not some flaky touch screen device. Antagonising your existing market and going off in search of different customers would always have been a very risky strategy. Research in Motion was one of the world's most innovative companies, its research driven by Mike Lazaridis, a man who has invested large sums of his own money in blue-skies research into theoretical physics. The Blackberry was the first device to make the internet - or at least email - truly mobile. But that was in a world where employers decided the direction of the technology we use - now a workers' revolution has changed all that. From now on, we will decide the shape of the tools that are essential to our lives, at home and in the office. The Blackberry story is entering its final chapter - at least as a public company. The $4.7bn planned sale to its biggest shareholder means the conclusion to this sorry tale is likely to take place in private, far from the relentless gaze of the Wall Street analysts.","Five years ago, Blackberry was one of the hottest technology companies around, with a market capitalisation of over $50bn, and apparently unchallenged in the business of supplying serious smartphones to serious businesses."
"It included an advert for a sex toy and one showing a woman wearing nipple tassels. UK watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that Wish.com must ensure that their advertisements are ""appropriately targeted"". Wish did not agree that the adverts could cause ""widespread offence"". In 2018, Wish.com breached similar guidelines three times in five months. The latest rulings involved four adverts that appeared in April and May 2020. One of the ads featured inside the BBC's Good Food Guide app. It showed a woman from the neck down wearing a corset with her chest partially exposed, covered only by nipple tassels. Three further advertisements, including one that featured an image of a male sex toy accompanied by descriptive language, were seen in the Google Play and Google News apps. ""We considered consumers using apps for recipes, the news and playing solitaire would not expect to see sexually explicit content,"" the ASA said in its ruling. ""We therefore concluded that in those contexts the ads were likely to cause both serious and widespread offence."" Limited punishment Wish agreed that the ads might not have been appropriate for all forums but did not agree that they were likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Immediate Media, the creators of the BBC Good Food app, said the advert in question was delivered as a result of programmatic advertising - the automated buying and selling of online adverts. The company did not consider the ad to be suitable for the app's audience. The ASA has limited powers to punish offenders, but it told the BBC it can hand out a number of sanctions to deter repeat offending. ""We can place our own ads in Google searches, stating that a particular advertiser has broken the rules,"" said the spokesman. The authority can also invoke mandatory pre-vetting for advertisers who have broken rules on grounds of taste and decency. ""An advertiser’s reputation can be badly damaged if it is seen to be ignoring rules designed to protect consumers,"" added the spokesman. The ASA did not explain in its ruling why, given Wish's previous breaches, it had chosen a reprimand rather than one of the other sanctions. It does not have the power to impose fines.","US online retailer Wish has been reprimanded for promoting ""overtly sexual"" adverts within apps that should have been suitable for children."
"A court document filed in New York says a ""binding agreement"" has been reached. The amount of compensation offered by Apple is not revealed, but the litigants were thought to have been seeking up to $840m (£495m). Apple has consistently denied any wrongdoing over e-book pricing. The impending trial, in which 33 US states and territories were seeking reparations from Apple on behalf of their citizens, was linked to a separate ruling last year, where a judge said Apple had violated anti-trust laws by striking deals to enable them to charge a higher price for some e-books in its online store. As well as the authorities taking action, several individuals from across the US were also seeking compensation for overpaying in their e-book purchases. The allegation was that Apple, a distributor of e-books, had illegally conspired with five of the biggest publishers to stop Amazon - a dominant force in the market - selling titles at a loss. Previously, publishers had sold e-books to distributors at a wholesale price, with retailers such as Amazon and Apple able to set their own sale prices. But the court case heard that the publishers (Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Penguin Group (USA) Inc, Macmillan and Simon & Schuster Inc) had agreed with Apple to move to an ""agency model,"" in which the publishers agree a minimum retail price with distributors, thus preventing them from offering titles at a loss. However Apple denied that it was involved in price-fixing, accusing plaintiffs of ""false accusations"", and is in the process of challenging last July's ruling. The publishers agreed to pay more than $166m to settle charges brought against them. The out-of-court settlement marks an about-turn from Apple, whose chief executive, Tim Cook, had previously dismissed the idea of reaching an agreement. The firm declined to comment on the decision. Any deal is subject to the outcome of Apple's appeal of last year's case.",Apple has agreed an out-of-court settlement in a case in which it was being sued by consumers who overpaid for e-books due to price-fixing between the tech giant and publishers.
"It said it had received between 12,000 and 13,000 US government requests for user data in the past year and a half. Most of them had ""concerned fraud, homicides, kidnappings, and other criminal investigations"", it said. Yahoo voiced frustration that it was unable to reveal the number of requests that had concerned national security. It urged the government to ""reconsider its stance on this issue"". ""Like all companies, Yahoo cannot lawfully break out Fisa [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] request numbers at this time because those numbers are classified,"" it said in a blog post by chief executive Marissa Mayer and general counsel Ron Bell. Under pressure FISA is widely seen as the legislation under which Prism operated. Earlier in the week Twitter also said it was important to be able to publish numbers of national security requests. And Google said lumping police requests with national security requests was ""a step back for users"". Tech firms have been under pressure to disclose information about data passed to the National Security Agency (NSA) since the Guardian and Washington Post revealed the existence of Prism - a programme giving the NSA access to user data held on the servers of tech firms including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, and Apple. The NSA later confirmed the existence of the surveillance scheme as well as a separate phone-records programme, which it said had helped it thwart terrorist plots in the US and more than 20 other countries. Rebuilding trust Technology companies, which initially denied any knowledge of the Prism project, are now rushing to rebuild trust from users shocked at the idea that their data was viewable by the authorities. Yahoo laid out plans to publish a twice-yearly global transparency report, the first of which will be issued ""later this summer"". ""Democracy demands accountability,"" the blog said. ""We appreciate - and do not take for granted- the trust you place in us."" Other companies have been quick to rebut suggestions they simply hand over data whenever asked. ""Only if appropriate, we retrieve and deliver the narrowest possible set of information to the authorities,"" said Apple. Facebook's general counsel Ted Ullyot said: ""We aggressively protect our users' data when confronted with such requests; we frequently reject such requests outright, or require the government to substantially scale down its requests, or simply give the government much less data than it has requested."" So far disclosures have revealed:","Yahoo is the latest company to reveal its dealings with the US authorities, following revelations about the Prism surveillance programme."
"The search giant has patented plans for software which slowly learns how you react on social networks. The software can mimic your usual responses to updates and messages from friends and relations to help cope with the daily data deluge. The software also analyses continuing interaction and flags messages that demand a more personal response. Life lessons ""The popularity and use of social networks and other types of electronic communication has grown dramatically in recent years,"" wrote Google software engineer Ashish Bhatia in the patent. ""It is often difficult for users to keep up with and reply to all the messages they are receiving."" In a bid to help people cope Mr Bhatia envisions a sophisticated system that collects information about all the different social networks someone has joined. This logs what they do and notes how they respond to the different types of messages, notifications, status changes, videos, images and links sent to them. The system analyses these responses so it can eventually start making suggestions of its own that, ideally, should be indistinguishable from those of an actual person. The suggested system should also be flexible enough to cope with many different types of event, use data culled from other interactions with a person and shape the responses to match the style demanded by different social networks. For instance, suggested responses to events on professional social networks should be more formal than those on services where someone interacts with friends and family. Instead of writing every response individually or clicking buttons to ""like"" or forward messages, the software would generate suggested responses which a person could simply agree to be posted on their behalf. Despite its potential sophistication, examples provided in the patent suggest it still needs refinement. In response to learning that an acquaintance called David has changed jobs, the system might suggest: ""Hey David, I am fine, You were in ABC corp for 3 years and you recently moved to XYZ corp, how do you feel about the difference, enjoying your new workplace?"" Social media technologist Hadley Beeman said the subtleties of human interaction might undermine the ability of Google's suggested system to pick out what matters most and flag it appropriately. A calendar appointment for lunch might look unimportant but loom large in someone's life for reasons the software cannot spot. ""The problem is that the 'important stuff' (or the trivial) depends on what our relationship is,"" said Ms Beeman. ""If I had lunch with you, for example, then your message about hating that terrible sandwich is actually relevant to me."" Prof Shaun Lawson from the University of Lincoln who studies social computing wondered who would be compelled to use such a service. ""Are we really so concerned with posting messages to every friend or follower that we feel compelled to have to automate that process?"" he said. Google's system seemed to underline the common misconception that social media was reducing contact between people, he said. ""The fabulous thing about social media is the reverse,"" said Prof Lawson. ""It facilitates human-to-human interaction in ways that were impossible even a few years ago.""","If maintaining your presence on social media is becoming a burden, Google may be able to help."
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Anthony Foxx said a taskforce had been set up to examine creating a record of drones and their users. The move comes after several reported incidents of drones hindering emergency services' efforts in fighting fires and other dangers. The problem is seen as particularly pressing as the number of drones given as Christmas presents this year is expected to soar. The task force will issue a report on how the database will be implemented late next month. Crucially, it will look at what kind of drones should be exempt from the database, such as those bought as toys. ""We feel the level of urgency here is sufficient for us to move as quickly as we possibly can,"" Mr Foxx said. He added in a statement: ""Registering unmanned aircraft will help build a culture of accountability and responsibility, especially with new users who have no experience operating in the U.S. aviation system. It will help protect public safety in the air and on the ground."" 'Stupidity' The National Press Photographers' Association (NPPA), which has campaigned against the implementation of some drone laws, agreed with a database in principle, but questioned how effective it would be in preventing unsafe drone use. ""The fact is that for the most part, when there are sightings, they don't actually get to recover the drone itself,"" NPPA lawyer Mickey Osterreicher told BBC News. ""So what would registering the drone accomplish?"" He added that further rules would not prevent bad drone use, drawing comparisons to people who drive cars without a licence or insurance: ""You really can't legislate against stupidity."" The plans have the support of several other groups in the aviation industry, including the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), which will help the task force to come up with recommendations. The group said: ""Because safe operations are essential for all users of the national airspace, AUVSI is also looking forward to continuing its work with the FAA and other supporters of the 'Know Before You Fly' campaign to educate newcomers to UAS technology about where they should and shouldn't fly."" Drone safety has been of prime concern to US authorities as emergency services repeatedly cite examples of drones hampering their work. California governor Jerry Brown recently shot down a proposed law to make it easier for emergency services to disable drones flying near disaster areas by using electronic jamming. That bill gained support after fire fighters had to down helicopters that were trying to extinguish devestating wildfires in northern California. The bill was opposed by several groups representing drone users' interests, including the NPPA. In a letter to the governor, the NPPA argued that it would make it too difficult for media to legally cover stories by using drones. After dismissing the proposed law, Mr Brown said he agreed with those who felt it could open a legal minefield for hobbyist drone owners acting within existing laws.

"Apple's new version has nothing inside the needle. ""This makes the emoji more versatile when used to describe Covid-19 vaccination,"" explained Emojipedia, a site that catalogues the icons. The site reports a surge in the use of the syringe emoji last year to talk about the Covid vaccine. Emojipedia said that while the syringe was once associated with blood donation, it saw a noticeable shift to it being used for vaccinations, alongside other emoji such as a face mask or a microbe. By December, the icon had become associated with words such as ""vaccine"", ""Covid-19"", ""Pfizer"", and ""Moderna"", it said. Apple has not officially made any comment on the revised graphic. But the change was discovered in the beta version for Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 14.5, which is likely to be available to ordinary users soon. New emojis must be approved by industry body the Unicode consortium - but existing ones are designed slightly differently by companies such as Apple, making tweaks possible. Google's Android has not announced any similar changes, but the major software makers usually converge on a similar design. In 2016, Apple changed the pistol emoji from a handgun to a water pistol, with Google, Samsung, Microsoft and others eventually following suit. The move was welcomed by the Royal Society for Public Health. It said Apple could play a part ""to increase confidence in Covid-19 vaccines"". ""We applaud everyone who joins in the global effort by doing what they can to reassure those who may be scared of needles or unnecessarily concerned about the vaccinations,"" chief executive Christina Marriott said. No entry for apps The change comes as Apple also placed limitations on developers building ""vaccine passport"" apps - ones that entitle the bearer access to somewhere based on a Covid test or vaccine. It said it had noticed an increase in such apps that generate ""passes"" used to access locations or services. But such apps will no longer be allowed unless they are working with recognised public health authorities or companies associated with them. That includes ""test kit manufacturers, laboratories, or healthcare providers"" as well as government and medical institutions, Apple said. The change is designed ""to ensure these apps responsibly handle sensitive data and provide reliable functionality"". It is the latest hurdle for so-called vaccine passports, which have long been proposed as an eventual alternative solution to lockdowns. But on Wednesday, UK think tank the Ada Lovelace Institute, which looks at how big data affects society, warned that such a system could present a host of issues. There appears to be growing momentum for a ""no jab, no job"" policy among some employers, but it's quite unlikely to happen in the short term and here's why. There are a host of technical, legal and political challenges for any company wanting to know about the vaccine status of their staff or customers. First, there is no officially recognised vaccine passport or certificate out there - and there is unlikely to be one until the government gives the go-ahead for any scheme to get access to NHS records. The Ada Lovelace Institute's report today warns against rushing out vaccine passports before there is clear evidence that a vaccinated person cannot pass on Covid-19 to someone else. Even when there is evidence, the report warns such a scheme could exacerbate mistrust in vaccines by making them appear mandatory. Lawyers say that treating employees who haven't been vaccinated differently could amount to discrimination, and data protection specialists say demanding to know someone's vaccine status may be against the law.","Apple is changing its syringe emoji to remove the dripping blood, as it becomes widely used to talk about the Covid-19 vaccine."
"Occupancy will be limited to 16 people, with a few exceptions for some venues. Lockdown parties hosted in Airbnb properties led the UK's Bed and Breakfast Association to warn it was putting communities at risk. The firm says it will pursue legal action if guests or hosts break the rules. ""Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,"" Airbnb said in a statement. It added that 73% of its listings explicitly banned parties but some hosts allowed small parties such as baby showers or birthday celebrations. Despite this, Airbnb acknowledged that some of its guests had chosen to ""take bar and club behaviour to homes sometimes rented through our platforms"". ""We think such conduct is incredibly irresponsible - we do not want that type of business, and anyone engaged in or allowing that behaviour does not belong on our platform,"" it said. Airbnb had already begun to impose stricter limits, with a ban on party houses that created persistent neighbourhood nuisance. To comply with social distancing rules, it had also removed the ""event friendly"" and ""parties and events allowed"" search filters. And earlier this month, it prevented some under-25s in the UK from booking entire homes, following successful pilots in Canada and the US. Like other travel firms, Airbnb has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic - although in July it said that customers had booked more than one million nights in a single day for the first time since March. The San Francisco-based firm also announced this week that it planned to list on the stock market. In April it raised $2bn (£1.5bn) from investors, who valued it at $18bn.",Airbnb has banned house parties as part of its efforts to comply with limits on gatherings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor All seven episodes of the marine-themed show are being made available to UK-based owners of select TVs. Until now, the BBC had only released programmes in this format via ultra-high definition (UHD) Blu-ray discs. Netflix and Amazon already stream some of their shows in 4K and HDR. The BBC suggested that owners of compatible screens should enjoy ""the spectacular animals, vibrant coral reefs and deep blue oceans"" as never before. More vivid The term 4K refers to the fact an image has four times as many pixels as a 1080p HD one, meaning it should appear more detailed and crisp. However, to appreciate this, viewers need to be sitting close enough to a large enough television, otherwise their eyes cannot tell the difference. As such, many experts agree that HDR actually has more impact. It takes advantage of the fact screens can go brighter and/or darker than they used to be able to, providing a greater dynamic range. As a result, the shadows of an image can be made less murky while the highlights - including light glinting off water - can be given more impact. HDR also uses a wider colour space - meaning it can show millions more colours than SDR - which should make Blue Planet II's sea life appear more realistic. ""It's very obvious the amount of colour that HDR gives you over normal pictures,"" commented Becky Roberts from What Hi-Fi magazine. ""It's definitely more impressive than the extra resolution alone, and it really lends itself to showing off the colourful coral reefs and other ocean images. ""But it has been quite a slow process by the BBC to get to this point."" Live HDR broadcasts Snippets of an earlier series, Planet Earth, were shown on iPlayer last year in 4K and HDR as part of an earlier trial. But part of the reason the BBC has taken until now to provide a complete show is that it is trying to pioneer a new HDR format. While Netflix and Amazon rely on existing technologies - known as HDR10 and Dolby Vision - to deliver extra colour information, the BBC has teamed up with the Japanese broadcaster NHK to create something called hybrid-log gamma (HLG). HLG is designed to be better suited to live broadcasts of sport and other events because it does not need to provide metadata - data about other data - unlike the other formats. ""Metadata is extremely difficult to relay through live production workflows,"" explained BBC Research & Development's principal technologist Andrew Cotton. ""The equipment just doesn't support it - and we know from where metadata is used elsewhere, it gets lost, it gets corrupted. It's a real problem."" HLG does have some theoretical downsides. It is not capable of describing as wide a dynamic range as Dolby Vision, nor can it provide information to calibrate the image to particular TV models. But Mr Cotton suggested that in practice viewers would not be disadvantaged. ""HLG still exceeds the capabilities of the human visual system, and doesn't need the 28 stops of dynamic range [that Dolby does],"" he said. ""Nor does it need the metadata to adapt the signal to different brightness displays. ""We've done some demos, and you can't see the difference between the two."" The BBC plans to release the special edition of Blue Planet II immediately after the final episode is broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. Close to 400 TV models and Roku's Streaming Stick+ 4K are included in the trial. Sky's Q Platform will also be able to stream the programmes in 4K, though not HDR, which it has yet to support. But there are still notable exceptions - neither Apple nor Amazon's latest set-top boxes offer compatible versions of iPlayer. Sony's top-end ZD9 and A1 sets are also currently excluded, although the Japanese firm said that they would soon be added. The BBC has yet to reveal when other programming will be released in the format.",The BBC's Blue Planet II programme is to become its first TV series to be made available in 4K resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) colour via its iPlayer catch-up service.
"The move presents a challenge to Twitch, which is built around a similar service, and was acquired by Amazon for $970m (£618m) in September. Steam has more than 100 million active accounts, nearly double the 60 million visitors a month claimed by Twitch. But one expert suggested Twitch was still likely to dominate the sector. Privacy options Steam is software provided by the US company Valve that allows people to buy, support development of, play and discuss titles created by thousands of video game publishers. It has emerged as the most popular way to buy Windows PC games. It also offers Mac and Linux-based software. Steam's new facility can be accessed three different ways: Anyone playing a game via Valve's software can opt to let their progress be watched by others, and they are offered various privacy options that allow them to control who can activate a stream. Broadcasters can provide voice-over commentary and text chat, but cannot appear in a superimposed webcam feed window as is common on Twitch, although they can show other computer desktop activity when not in-game. Other restrictions include the fact that broadcasts cannot be saved to be watched back later, and that players have no obvious way to make money from their streams - two activities Twitch allows. However, Steam benefits from the fact that it does not require visitors to watch adverts before game streams begin. ""Valve has listened to what its customers have been asking for and has offered live broadcasting in its own way, which basically provides it with free marketing for the games sold on its platform,"" said Lewis Ward, a video games analyst from the IDC consultancy. ""Getting into the streams is very easy, and it seems it's done enough on the security side so if you don't want certain people to view your activity or are a parent who has concerns about your kids, there are ways to block it. ""So, it's done the core of what Twitch does but still lacks some aspects that make Twitch distinctive. And while I think it's a very interesting first step, I don't think it matches where Twitch is today."" The two companies are not alone in efforts to make gaming a spectator sport. Google's YouTube is another major force, allowing players to stream and watch live gameplay as well as pre-recorded clips. Hitbox.tv, Ustream and the in-development GamingLive.tv provide other alternatives. But Mr Ward suggested that Steam Broadcasting should be able to co-exist alongside the dominant player. ""Twitch is platform-agnostic - it's kind of like Switzerland - and that neutrality means it can partner with lots of different companies,"" he said. ""It can focus on mobile and consoles as well as PCs - Twitch and Steam started allowing account linking over a year ago - so, I think it can take a broader view of gaming broadcast capabilities, which is where the market is going. ""And so long as Valve stays focused only on broadcasts of games played on its platform, then that's going to limit the potential growth of the new service.""",Steam - the popular PC video gaming platform - is adding the ability to stream gameplay so that others can watch online.
"The company said it was closing down the messaging service so it could concentrate on the Kin cryptocurrency it has also created. In a blog, Kik Interactive said the decision had been forced on it by a legal wrangle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over Kin. The decision also means that 80 staff who keep Kik running will be let go. No date has been given for when the Kik app will close. Kik Messenger launched in 2010 and proved popular largely because it lets people register and use it without providing a phone number or other credentials. The app has also proved controversial and a BBC News investigation in 2018 suggested it had featured in 1,100 UK child sexual abuse cases police had investigated in the past five years. In response, Kik said it was ""constantly assessing and improving its trust and safety measures"". Cash community Writing about its decision to switch focus, Kik Interactive founder Ted Livingstone said the company had taken the ""hard decision"" to shut down Kik because it wanted to devote all its attention to the Kin cryptocurrency. By shutting down Kik and shrinking to 19 employees, the company could cut its overheads by 85%, he said, giving it a much better chance of winning the legal fight with the SEC. He acknowledged the difficulty the decision would cause as it would mean laying off people who had families and who had ""poured their hearts and souls into Kik and Kin for over a decade"". The legal row blew up because the SEC wanted the Kin crypto-cash launch categorised in the same way as the initial stock offering for companies that floated on the stock exchange. It said when Kik Interactive had launched Kin, it had effectively conducted an $100m (£80m) ""unregistered"" stock offering. Mr Livingstone said it had to resist the classification of Kin as ""security"" because this categorisation would ""kill"" its usability and that of other similar crypto-cash systems. ""We made the decision to step forward and fight,"" he said. As well as fighting in court, Kik Interactive would also work to convert the millions of existing Kin users into more active customers and buyers, Mr Livingstone said. Kin currently had two million ""monthly active earners"" and 600,000 ""monthly active spenders"". And growing the community of Kin users significantly would make it far harder for the SEC to prevail. ""Together we will win,"" Mr Livingstone added.",Kik Messenger is shutting down despite the service having millions of active users around the world.
"From 2018, people who cannot have a dish installed will be able to receive Sky over the internet instead. The company said the move would help it reach a further six million customers across Europe. One analyst said the development was a ""logical step"", but customers would need to live in an area with fast broadband speeds to benefit. ""I don't think Sky is giving up on other things but they see this as an opportunity,"" said Toby Syfret, TV analyst at the Enders consultancy. ""There are about two million households in the UK, mostly in dense urban areas, where people can't put up dishes. ""If they can offer the full Sky experience without the need for a dish, that is broadening their offer. ""But there will be questions about which homes can get it. Not everybody has the necessary broadband speed."" Sky is also facing competition from new rivals such as BT and TalkTalk, which deliver pay-TV over the internet. Sky already sells its Now TV streaming service, offering a small selection of television channels and a library of on-demand programmes over the internet. However, the company told the BBC its new dish-free option was designed to provide a more complete service. Details of which channels will be carried, and whether the service will support ultra-high definition 4K broadcasts have yet to be decided. The company is currently in a dispute with broadcaster Discovery, which has threatened to remove its 12 channels from Sky on 1 February. It claims Sky does not pay a ""fair price"" for its channels - but Sky says Discovery's threat is about ""commercial self-interest"".

"By Jen CopestakeTechnology reporter But the Duchess of Sussex came second to the overall winner of the most queried term - ""World Cup"" - in the company's search trends review for 2018. ""Royal wedding"" and ""royal baby"" were the top two news event trends. The duchess announced her first pregnancy in October while on tour with Prince Harry in Australia. Of course, there were two royal weddings this year: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May; and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in October, which may have added to the overall figures. ""Roxanne Pallett"" the former Emmerdale actor who courted controversy on Celebrity Big Brother after accusing housemate Ryan Thomas of punching her, came second in most-searched-for celebrities. Pallett ended up quitting her radio show on York-based Minster FM over the fallout from the incident, calling herself ""the most hated girl in Britain"". Celebrities who struggled with substance abuse took the third and fourth spots: ""Demi Lovato"", who had an apparent overdose, and ""Ant McPartlin"", who had well-documented struggles with rehab and recovery. McPartlin took time off from his TV presenting roles including ITV's I'm a Celebrity - which was the top trending TV Show - after crashing his car while under the influence of alcohol. Despite being the most watched television drama last year, ""Bodyguard"" was pipped to the post by ""Killing Eve"" - numbers three and two respectively in the television category. Marvel's superhero film Black Panther was the fourth top trending overall query as well as being the most searched for movie title. It was the studio's first film to focus on Africa and feature a predominantly black cast. Black Panther was also one of the highest grossing movies of the year, taking more than $1bn (£800m) worldwide. Among the more prosaic searches in the ""How To...?"" list were ""How to bleed radiators?"" at number eight and ""How to put lights on a Christmas tree?"" at number nine. Perhaps reflecting wider privacy concerns on social media, ""How to delete Instagram?"" and ""How to delete Facebook?"" were fifth and sixth on the list. Jeremy Clarkson's return to prime-time TV with a classic moment on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" made it into the most searched trends. The show introduced an ""Ask the Host"" lifeline to its Phone a Friend, 50/50 and Ask The Audience options. Clarkson gave a confident answer to ""What is an Ibex?"" leading to a flurry of searches for the wild goat. Unfortunately he said it was a deer and lost his contestant £15,000. Finishing ahead of this gaffe ""What is Bitcoin?"" topped the list of quizzical searches. Considering the wild price fluctuations and opaque nature of how the crypto-currency works, it does not come as a surprise. Heads were also scratched over ""What is GDPR"" the new European Union legislation on data protection which made second spot on the What is? list.","""Meghan Markle"" was the most searched-for person's name for the second year running on Google's UK search service."
"By Dan SimmonsClick presenter A survey of security professionals in six countries, including the UK, by the Ponemon Institute found 90% had been hit by at least one successful attack. Staff in the utilities, energy, health and transport sectors were questioned. Experts said the results are a wake-up call for an industry that often under-reports attacks and the damage done. Staff tasked with keeping critical infrastructure systems running often kept details secret for security reasons, they said. The report also concludes that a lack of resources and intelligence about ""relentless and continuous"" cyber-attacks are the industry's biggest concern. Daily attacks The Ponemon Institute, which specialises in cyber-security and privacy issues, used an anonymous poll to quiz more than 700 security professionals in the US, UK, Germany, Australia, Mexico and Japan who work to protect critical infrastructure. Of those responding, nine out of 10 said the organisation they worked for had been damaged by a successful cyber-attack in the last two years. Many reported being hit by between three and six such incidents. Respondents said around half of the successful attacks had resulted in downtime of critical systems. This was because essential systems were knocked out as part of the attack or operators had to turn off systems to repair the damage done. ""These are multiple, successful attacks on the physical world using cyber-technologies,"" Eitan Goldstein, from security firm Tenable, which commissioned the report, told the BBC. ""That is a really big change and that's why the risk isn't just theoretical any more. ""We believe the reason behind it is increased connectivity to industrial control systems. ""Today we want to be able to do analytics and predictive maintenance in our power plants, but the proliferation of smart devices and sensors and IoT is really increasing our cyber-exposure to attack. ""In many cases, organisations don't even know what is connected to the internet and what can be accessed by hackers."" 'Troubling picture' Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's Cyber Security Centre, questioned the unexpectedly high response rate in the survey but added: ""Even if the results are perhaps slightly higher than might otherwise be the case, because the group is self-selecting, this data as a whole still paints a troubling picture. ""Most information in the public domain tends to be anecdotal, or driven by specific incidents. This is one of the few reports I've seen that has the number of respondents to make it potentially statistically meaningful. ""Not only are elements of critical infrastructure being attacked, they are being 'successfully' attacked: these attacks are having a tangible impact, sometimes on multiple occasions."" How to protect key infrastructure ""The data also reveals worrying themes, such as a lack of skilled staff or appropriate incident response plans to mitigate the attacks."" He added: ""In many ways it doesn't matter what the motive of the attackers is. It could be criminals looking to extort money with a scattergun-type attack in which the infrastructure provider happens to get caught, or state actors seeking to disrupt services. The results on society are the same. ""When you think what critical infrastructure is, it's something that we simply must invest in protecting."" The full report on the dangers to critical infrastructure can be seen on BBC Click on BBC1, News Channel and BBC World News this weekend and on iPlayer afterwards.","A growing number of cyber-attacks on key installations have successfully put systems out of action over the past two years, a study has revealed."
"In total, more than 52 million Switch consoles have been sold since the device was launched in 2017. The SNES was introduced in 1990 in Japan and went on to sell 49 million units worldwide. However, the company has warned the console's production has been affected by the coronavirus outbreak in China. A Pokemon video game tournament in Hong Kong has already been cancelled following concerns about the spread of the virus. The launch of the Nintendo Switch was a critical moment in Nintendo's history, following disappointing sales of its predecessor the Wii U. But it proved popular with gamers, overtaking sales of the Wii U after only 10 months on sale. Best-selling Nintendo Switch games Source: Nintendo Some analysts suggest Nintendo may have sold as many Switch consoles as Microsoft has sold Xbox One devices, although Microsoft no longer reports its sales figures. Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst for the IHS Markit consultancy, said it was likely that Switch console sales would overtake Xbox One in the first nine months of 2020. Nintendo sold almost 11 million Switch consoles in the run-up to Christmas. Of those, about five million were the new lower-cost Switch Lite, which cannot be connected to a television. Nintendo also launched the Switch console in China in December 2019, although many of the company's most popular games are not yet available there. Mr Harding-Rolls said he expected Switch sales in 2020 to further improve on this ""with a full year of Switch Lite in the market"". ""Digital revenue (game downloads, in-game content and subscriptions) is up and amounted to around $1.5 billion (£1.15bn) for the whole of 2019. That is up by over 50% from 2018 and illustrates both a market trend with a shift to digital consumption and also the rapid evolution of this part of Nintendo's business,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls.","The Nintendo Switch has become the company's third best-selling home console, overtaking the old Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter It's because you're not just downloading the content you want - which may be a small amount of data - but the data-heavy adverts and all the tracking technology that surrounds them. And it's costing mobile users, who are charged for that traffic to their phones, a lot of money. That, at least, is the allegation in an advert placed in the Financial Times this morning by an Israeli firm called Shine. Under the stark headline: ""Fact: mobile ads consume a substantial amount of the data mobile consumers pay for and it's getting worse"", it argues that we are all helping to subsidise advertisers. It goes on to call on the GSMA, the trade association for the mobile industry, to back a move to ""zero rate"" ads, meaning consumers would not be charged for that data. Shine is a business which is trying to sell ad-blocking software to mobile networks, so it is not a neutral observer. ""We believe that consumers should not be subsidising billion dollar ad tech businesses,"" Shine's Roi Carthy tells me. ""We hope the GSMA and its membership see the importance of protecting consumers and act on the matter swiftly."" The GSMA says that it cannot comment on commercial negotiations involving operators but says it supports ""initiatives that provide consumers with more transparency and control over the privacy of their personal data"". Ad-blocking has grown increasingly popular, with plenty of tools now available to improve your browsing experience. A recent survey showed nearly 200 million people were using blockers - that's still a small proportion of the global web audience but 12 million of them are in the UK, which indicates that the British are particularly hostile to adverts. Up until now, it has been much harder to block adverts on mobile phones, but this week Apple is expected to release its latest mobile operating system which will allow ad-blocking tools in its Safari browser. That should give a big boost to businesses which will be marketing their ad-blocking services to iPhone users, and even to Shine, which is trying to persuade mobile operators to install its technology at the network level. This sounds like a great consumer cause - until you remember that the entire business model of many of the web businesses we use most is dependent on advertising. When you check the weather forecast online, watch a music video or chat about recipes on a cookery forum, the chances are that you get those services free in exchange for having those annoying adverts. No wonder there is something akin to panic in the online advertising industry, especially among businesses which are just getting their mobile ad strategies off the ground. What makes it worse for them is that Facebook, which has made a very successful transition to mobile, won't see its ads blocked because it controls its app platform. That means that everyone else could soon be shutting up shop as their ad revenues evaporate. But perhaps we should take the warnings of the catastrophic impact of ad-blocking with a pinch of salt. The advertising industry is nothing if not ingenious and will come up with new ways of reaching consumers - ideas like the branded content pioneered on sites like Buzzfeed. And, if the pain of waiting while another advert loads on the web article you want to read, persuades more of us to resort to blockers, the advertising industry will learn a valuable lesson. After all, annoying your customers so much that they want you out of their lives does not sound like a great marketing strategy.","Ever wondered why it takes an age for some web pages to load on your mobile phone, even when you have a good signal?"
"The mapping software angered users who said it was riddled with inaccuracies, misplaced towns and cities and omitted key landmarks. Apple said it appreciated all the customer feedback it was receiving about the app and would work hard to improve it. The problems emerged a day before the global launch of its iPhone 5 handset. Hundreds of people have camped out for days to ensure they are among the first to buy one of the smartphones. At Apple's flagship store on London's Regent Street almost 1300 people were in line for one of the phones. The mapping system comes with updates to Apple's phone operating system and is bundled in with the iPhone 5. Lost towns Apple embarked on the development of its own mapping software after deciding it no longer wanted to use Google's equivalent. Apple's own system has been created using data from navigation firm TomTom and others. In a statement Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the launch of Apple Maps was a major undertaking for the firm. ""We are continuously improving it, and as Maps is a cloud-based solution, the more people use it, the better it will get,"" she said. ""We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better,"" added Ms Muller. Apple was also planning to work closely with external developers to put the work they have done on apps for local transport into the mapping software, she said. On Friday TomTom, which provides the data underlying the map app, said it was ""more than willing"" to help Apple improve the application. ""We stand by the quality of our maps,"" said TomTom spokeswoman Caroline Fisher. She added that although TomTom did not have a team in place at Apple it was happy to supply developers to help make the app work better. It is unclear whether this will be enough to mollify users who took to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other social media networks to mock the failings of the mapping application. The BBC received a lot of complaints about Apple's maps, with users saying that some towns, such as Stratford Upon Avon, were missing and others were in the wrong place. In addition some places, including a train station, were shown to be in the ocean and many others were wrongly labelled. Before the release of the iOS6, Apple's updated mobile operating system, many developers had warned about the poor quality of the mapping app. It was particularly poor, they said, at finding local businesses via search. Apple seems to be aware of a need to beef up its mapping expertise. Many tech news sites noted that Apple had placed a lot of adverts on its jobs site for mapping experts in the past week or so. There is not currently a Google Maps app available in Apple's App Store, although Google's system is still accessible via the phone's web browser. Spot the difference","Apple has responded to fierce criticism of its mapping software, saying the application will ""improve""."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Pat Walshe told BBC News he had had the issue resolved twice, only to discover last week it had happened again. The issue involves his photo being run next to text from another source about a dead American who had the same name. He now aims to make an official complaint to data privacy watchdogs. Google has once again fixed the flaw. Personal contacts A day after BBC News raised the matter, Mr Walshe's photo had been removed from the ""knowledge box"" near the top of the Google's search results. The US company has not explained or apologised for the mistake. But a spokeswoman said she did not believe the correction had been made as a result of BBC News's intervention. Mr Walshe said he had first flagged the problem several years ago and then again in February of this year, after which he had hoped the issue had been resolved for good. It was only when he discussed the matter at a conference in Berlin and another attendee carried out a Google Search that he realised one of his profile images had again been linked to an unrelated Wikipedia entry. ""Everybody felt it was funny,"" he said. ""But what if the text's biography was that of someone who had committed a terrible crime? ""That could have consequences for me in an age of artificial-intelligence-driven decision-making, for example."" Google provides a way to for users to ""suggest changes"" but Mr Walshe said he had ultimately had to resort to personal contacts to have the matter addressed in the past. 'Simpler process' The first time he involved a lawyer he knew at Google. The second time he emailed Google's chief executive directly - and when he received no response, raised the matter at a major conference attended by the company. As the former privacy director of the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), Mr Walshe said, he had the means to ensure he was not ignored - but others in a similar situation might not. ""I will make a formal complaint both to the ICO [Information Commissioner's Office] and to the Data Protection Commissioner of Ireland because it's very clear that individuals need a much simpler process by which they can exercise their rights."" he said. An American author told the BBC he has faced related problems of his own. In Ernest Dempsey's case, the Knowledge Box shows his photo and the images of books he has written, but the biography of a Pakistani writer. ""It's been an impossibly infuriating process to try to get Google to fix the bio with my image,"" he explained. ""The mix-up is there is another writer who used my name as his pen name, which is fine. But I get emails every month about how I went from Pakistan to America to be a writer. ""Perhaps it's cost me money, perhaps not. But either way it's frustrating."" Google referred BBC News to a blog it had posted in July explaining how people and organisations could provide ""authoritative feedback"" about mistakes. ""If an image or a Google Images results preview that's shown in a knowledge panel does not accurately represent the person, place or thing, we'll... fix the error,"" it says.","Google has angered a privacy expert by repeatedly identifying him as a ""dwarf character actor"" famous for playing a winged monkey in The Wizard of Oz."
"San Francisco based Captiv8 said internet ""influencers"" with a following of three to seven million people could also make $75,000 on average for a promotional post on Instagram. A native advert on Twitter cost about $30,000 on average, it added. The Advertising Standards Authority said these posts must be properly marked as advertisements. Celebrities and their agents have in recent years found lucrative opportunities to endorse goods and services across social media and video websites. Last week, Kim Kardashian published a video clip on Instagram in association with the hair vitamins provider SugarBear Hair. The message began with the hashtag #ad - which denotes it as an advertisement - and read: ""Excited to be partnering with @sugarbearhair to share their amazing hair vitamins with you! These chewable gummy vitamins are delicious and a favourite part of my hair care routine."" Such adverts can bring in serious money if your subscriber numbers are high, according to Captiv8, a marketing company that brokers social media deals. According to Captiv8's data, which was given to the New York Times, ""someone with three million to seven million followers can charge, on average, $187,500 for a post on YouTube"". It added that $75,000 was the average fee for ""a post on Instagram or Snapchat"", while $30,000 was the charge for a message on Twitter. One digital marketing agency that spoke to the BBC said Captiv8's findings seemed ""possible but a little high"", while another said the number was ""not surprising at all"". Both asked not to be named. Influencers with a more modest following on social media still stand to make meaningful income from native advertisements. Personalities with 50,000 to 500,000 followers can make $2,500 per YouTube ad, and $1,000 for an Instagram post. Hashtag Ad The Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates advertisements across TV, print and the web, says these promotional posts must be clearly marked. ""If a social media user has been paid to post something and does not have editorial control over the post, then it becomes an ad,"" an ASA official told the BBC. ""In this instance, they need to label the post appropriately and clearly state it is an ad. ""This label must be immediately obvious to the reader before they engage in watching or reading the post."" Gifts and other perks should technically be deemed as payments, it added. The ASA regulates adverts produced and distributed in the UK only. In 2012, it banned a Nike promotional campaign published on footballer Wayne Rooney's Twitter feed after ruling it had not been clearly ""identifiable as marketing communications"". However, to this day the Tweet remains online. Then two years later, the ASA blocked a series of YouTube videos that promoted a challenge to an Oreo biscuit ""lick race"". Meanwhile, in July, Warner Bros reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, after the entertainment group was found to be paying YouTube personalities for promotional videos of its game Shadow of Mordor.","YouTube personalities charge an average of $187,500 (£143,000) for each sponsored video, a talent agency says."
"The attack exploits loopholes in widely used technology that helps smart TVs receive tailored adverts. Once hijacked, the TVs could be made to send messages on behalf of attackers, find other vulnerable devices in a home or launch other attacks across the net. Detecting and stopping the attack would be difficult, said the researchers. The attack uses the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) standard that is widely supported in smart television sets sold in Europe. The HbbTV system was designed to help broadcasters exploit the internet connection of a smart TV to add extra information to programmes or so advertisers can do a better job of targeting viewers. But Yossef Oren and Angelos Keromytis, from the Network Security Lab, at Columbia University, have found a way to hijack HbbTV using a cheap antenna and carefully crafted broadcast messages. ""For this attack you do not need an internet address, you do not need a server,"" Mr Oren told Forbes. ""You just need a roof and an antenna and once you are done with your attack, there's completely no trace of you."" By exploiting loopholes in HbbTV, smart TVs could be hijacked by attackers and used to do anything their real owners would do. For instance, the researchers said, if owners had logged in to Facebook via a TV app, the attack could be used to post messages on the social network on that person's behalf. Alternatively, wrote the researchers in a paper, the loopholes could be used to bombard a target website with data or to log spurious votes or clicks. It could also be used to scan devices inside a home network for vulnerabilities or display on-screen notices asking for credit card or other sensitive information. In areas where lots of people owned smart TVs, a $250 (£150) antenna could reach thousands of people, said Mr Oren. A bigger antenna could extend the reach of the attack considerably, he added. Millions of smart TVs use HbbTV across Europe, and more than 60 broadcasters in the region have signed up to use the technology. Mr Oren said the standards body that oversaw HbbTV had been told about the security loophole. However, he added, the body did not think the threat from the attack was serious enough to require a re-write of the technology's security.","Millions of smart TVs can be hijacked by burying attack code in signals broadcast to the net-connected devices, security experts warn."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Web-based Luvo will be able to answer simple queries such as how to order a replacement card. Designed using IBM Watson technology, the virtual agent is able to understand and learn from human interactions. In future, Luvo may be able to understand if a customer was feeling frustrated or unhappy and change its tone and actions accordingly, IBM said. The service will initially be rolled out to RBS and NatWest customers, starting in December with about 10% of RBS customers in Scotland. Previously, Luvo had been piloted among 1,200 RBS and NatWest staff. For the bank, the chatbot is complementary to existing customer service agents. ""Luvo frees advisers from spending time on simple, easily-addressed queries so they can help customers with more complex issues,"" said Jane Howard, head of personal banking. It will start off with about 10 questions it is equipped to answer but as the cognitive system learns over time, IBM is confident it can be expanded to ""more complex areas"". The bank will make it clear to customers that they are talking to a bot, and they will have the option to move the conversation to a human agent at any point. ""We will monitor customer feedback and, if we find that customers are getting frustrated, we will quickly look to address that,"" Ms Howard told the BBC. 'Never deviate' IBM is not the only company using artificial intelligence in banking. This week, rival IPsoft, which already employs its virtual agent Amelia in a range of industries, announced a similar deal. Amelia will provide customer service in one of Sweden's largest banks, SEB. Chetan Dube, IPsoft's chief executive, said that virtual staff represented a ""fundamental shift in the way that banks manage their operations"". ""Virtual agents never deviate from regulations and provide a full audit trail of every interaction,"" he said.",Customers at Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest may soon be sorting out issues with help from a virtual chatbot.
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter But he says the West should respond by competing with China and its technologies, rather than disengaging. Mr Schmidt now chairs the Pentagon's Defence Innovation Board. The UK is currently reviewing whether to continue letting Huawei help build its 5G mobile networks amid growing pressure to exclude the Chinese firm. ""There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security,"" Mr Schmidt told a BBC Radio 4 documentary. He said it was possible to think of the company as a means of ""signals intelligence"" - a reference to spy agencies like the UK's GCHQ or NSA in the US. ""There's no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,"" Mr Schmidt added. ""However that happened, we're sure it happened."" Huawei has consistently denied accusations that it is an arm of the Chinese state, or passes on customer data to the authorities. ""The allegations made by Eric Schmidt, who now works for the US government, are simply not true and as with similar assertions in the past, are not backed by evidence,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief told the BBC. ""Huawei is independent from any government, including the Chinese government. ""Where we do agree, and something we've always said, is that applying standards globally ensures innovation, fosters competition and benefits everyone."" Anti-China prejudices Eric Schmidt says the real issue with Huawei lies in the challenge to US leadership it represents: a Chinese company operating on a global stage that is building a better product than its competitors. ""It's extremely important that we have choices,"" he told the BBC. ""The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good."" Eric Schmidt spent a decade and a half as chief executive and then executive chairman of Google and its parent company Alphabet. He acknowledges that over a long career in Silicon Valley, he had underestimated China's ability to innovate. ""I have carried the prejudices about China in my years working with them,"" he said. ""That they're very good at copying things, that they're very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they're not going to do anything new. They're very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff. Those prejudices need to be thrown out. ""The Chinese are just as good, and maybe better, in key areas of research and innovation as the West. ""They're putting more money into it. They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete."" He denies the Chinese model of state-directed investment in technology is intrinsically more successful than a free-market model. However, he believes the West needs to make the most of its strengths by: ""Most people would prefer to live and work in the West than work in China,"" he says. Catching up One of the problems in the US and particularly in Silicon Valley, Mr Schmidt believes, is a historical blindness to the role of the government in supporting research. ""Everything you see in Silicon Valley to the first order came from initial federal science grants of one kind or another."" Last year he chaired a US National Security Commission looking at artificial intelligence. China's advances in this field are a major concern. ""I would say they are a few years behind,"" he says. ""Not five years, and not 10 years. And there's evidence of China closing the gap in the next few years. ""So the question is: what happens then? Well obviously, artificial intelligence has military and national security applications."" China's work on quantum computing, he adds, is on a par with that of the West, and could even be ahead. Mr Schmidt views the decoupling of the technology sectors in China and the US as ""undesirable"", believing it will lead to two distinct systems. ""Once you diverge these global platforms, you don't get them back,"" he says. ""We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less. ""China's going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. ""The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is. ""It is in the West's interest that every technology platform has Western values in them."" Rough rivalry Mr Schmidt is cautious about picking national champions and supporting them. But he says there are weaknesses in the West's own capacity, particularly in not having foundries that manufacture semiconductor chips. He says it would be better for China to use chips from Western companies rather than build its own. The rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world is of ""great concern"", he concludes, pointing to the fact that more than half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have been founded by foreign-born nationals. Faced with a challenge from China, he draws on his own Silicon Valley experience. ""The best strategy is to think of it as a competition not unlike the tech companies, where there's brutal competition,"" he said. ""[It will be] as rough as it could be - largely unregulated between the various players - where we seek to win."" The New Tech Cold War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Friday and again on Tuesday at 16:00 BST.","Huawei poses challenges to national security and has engaged in unacceptable acts, Google's former boss Eric Schmidt has told the BBC."
"The trial is designed to check that a previously unused emergency communications system works properly. Unlike other alerts - such as natural disaster warnings - there was no way to opt out, except switching a device off or otherwise blocking its connection. Some have described the test as a ""Trump Alert"" - but the US leader was not personally involved in the trial. Instead, the nationwide event is being run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which would also be in direct control of the system if a real alert was ordered by the US President, Donald Trump. It is intended to be used to warn of major threats, including: The alert produced a tone and showed a notification saying: ""THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed."" It was being broadcast from mobile phone masts for about 30 minutes from 14:18 ET (19:18 BST) - with devices displaying only a single message. The test was mandated under a 2015 law that said one must be run at least once every three years. It was originally scheduled for September but was delayed in order to avoid any confusion while Hurricane Florence response efforts were continuing in North and South Carolina. After the alert, Twitter and Facebook immediately lit up with people discussing the merits of the system, or complaining that they had not received the notification. Others posted parody alerts, featuring photoshopped images. Legal challenge Congress has placed limits on when the president can trigger such a warning, saying it must relate to a natural or man-made disaster or public safety threat. Even so, there was a last-minute effort to block the test and wider use of the Presidential Alert system. A journalist, a breastfeeding advocate and a fitness instructor teamed up to sue Fema, claiming the technology was a violation of their rights to be free from ""government-compelled listening"". The legal action alleged that the test could be ""traumatic"" to children and that the system was open to abuse. ""Officials - including [President] Trump - are free to define 'act of terrorism' and 'threat to public safety' as they see fit, potentially broadcasting arbitrary, biased, irrational and/or content-based messages to hundreds of millions of people,"" the legal action claimed. However, a New York judge refused the request at a hearing on Wednesday morning. Others have used social media to complain about and mock the trial. Several have noted that anyone wanting to know the president's thoughts can turn to Twitter. But in response, others have highlighted that the system was developed and put in place during the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama. Moreover, after two previous alert system errors - the first involving a false alarm about a missile attack on Hawaii, the second involving a presidential proclamation about Senator John McCain's death being sent to the wrong people - there is an argument that the technology needs to undergo regular public tests if it is to be relied on.","More than 200 million US mobile phones have received a test ""Presidential Alert"" notification."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor With the top-end model costing £1,149, customers are paying a premium to swap their fingerprint sensor for a facial scanner and the ability to make an animated monkey or poo emoji copy their bemused looks. In opting to refer to the model as ""ten"" rather than ""x"", the firm has also thrown its naming convention into a bit of confusion - will there ever be an iPhone 9 - or indeed IX? Of course, that's a problem for another day. And the internet has had plenty else to chew over in the meantime... Cnet The two biggest questions for me focus on the iPhone X's most daring design change, ditching the home button. Will it actually make the phone more convenient to use? And will using your face to unlock the phone benefit you, or is it just a workaround? The Verge The iPhone X may be the most powerful iPhone ever, but compared to almost any other Android flagships, it's hard to pick out a category where it leads the pack - at least on paper when comparing raw specifications. But if Apple has shown one thing time and again with every iPhone generation, it's that optimisation of hardware and software matter just as much - if not more. Wall Street Journal The iPhone X's new design - a 5.8in, edge-to-edge display -has raised hopes that it can reverse Apple's fortunes in China, where sales have fallen six straight quarters. Chinese consumers are more influenced by a phone's appearance than consumers in other markets, and Apple had kept the same appearance for three years. Bloomberg A $1,000 iPhone could add as much as 6% to Apple's 2018 earnings per share... but that depends on the iPhone X being a hit, and there's more competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which timed the introduction of their new phones around Apple's launch to attract customers who may be deterred by the iPhone X's price. Slashgear Apple has crafted a stunning new flagship. In a time when existing iPhones were starting to look a little - dare I say - pedestrian in comparison to what Samsung, LG, and others were doing in hardware, the iPhone X has accelerated through and can spar with the best of them. Engadget What did bother me a little more than expected were the bezels that run around the screen... Given that Apple's competition has done an incredible job trimming the cruft from around their displays, I can't help but feel that the iPhone X's design doesn't have the same kind of impact as, say, the Essential or Samsung's recent Galaxys. Wired The very notion of using your face as the key to your digital secrets presents some fundamental problems... It's very hard to hide your face from someone who wants to coerce you to unlock your phone, like a mugger, a customs agent, or a policeman who has just arrested you. In some cases, criminal suspects in the US can invoke the Fifth Amendment protections from self-incrimination to refuse to give up their phone's passcode. That same protection doesn't apply to your face. Financial Times All the focus today was on the innovations in the X.But it all made the new 8 look like a rather boring, ""plain old"" iPhone - and the price for that has just gone up $50 as well. Techcrunch The X is the best iPhone, no questions, and it's quickly jumped to the top of the best phones, period. Yeah, it's going to cost you, but you already knew that.

But no, thanks. @DrOlufunmilayo I think the leaks spoiled the iPhone X keynote, but Apple also didn't do enough to show why augmented reality matters. @tomwarren The choice is simple: The iPhone X or 363 coffees. @joshtgoossen Releasing the iPhoneX and 8 at the same time is strange, surely those who get the 8 will feel they've not got the latest iPhone. @Mr_Iconic The iPhone X is over a thousand dollars but I get to make myself into a poop emoji, so ya, it's worth it. @donaldcookie Facebook iPhone X has facial recognition. It'll look at your face and tell you that you can't afford it. - Abhimanyu Singh Face ID seems like an over-engineered fix that they were forced to include because they couldn't integrate a fingerprint scanner into the screen - Nick Farina How on earth can they justify the same price in $s as in £s... utterly shameful! I won't be buying on that basis alone. - Darren Taylor They made the 8 almost identical to the 7 so people would have to spend the extra money for the X. And I'm sure I'll buy one even though I know what they did. - Patrick Michael Google has just been given a gift. Apple could have really done something that would have caused Android fans angst today. It did not. Instead, we're looking toward the Pixel 2 launch in October with renewed interest. - Robert Scoble Reddit Apple isn't the first in facial recognition (by a long shot) but they will without a doubt make facial recognition competitive by making it better. This is how they always work. - Leprecon The lack of any fingerprint reader could cause problems for people who either cover their face for religious or professional reasons as well as for blind people. Really hoping Apple thought about these issues. - danius353 The iPhone home button was what made it look like a iPhone. The little round button was so iconic.

"The problem is with the cars' eCall feature, which alerts emergency services of an accident and relays a vehicle's location to them. But a fault means it is possible that the wrong location could be sent. The problem affects 1,292,258 cars in the United States, and the company says it is preparing a fix for customers in other countries too. The safety recall information form the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that Mercedes ""determined that a safety risk cannot be ruled out"". Because the problem is software-related, the fix can usually be done ""over the air"" - via a wireless download using the car's existing mobile data connection. But if it cannot, due to a bad connection or other problems, owners will be able to bring their cars into an authorised dealer to have the update applied. The eCall system is mandatory in the EU for all cars sold since 2018 - and the US documents reveal that the reason for the investigation was a known case of the wrong location being sent ""in the European market"" in October 2019. Mercedes-Benz in the UK told the BBC: ""This software update will also be implemented in other countries and we are in close contact with the local authorities."" But it said it was not providing any further details until an official announcement of the fix. What went wrong? In the US, all 1,292,258 affected vehicles will have to receive a software update to fix the problem. That includes more than 200 different models and variants made between 2016 and 2021, including: The fault, Mercedes said, was in the software connected to the communications module used by the emergency call system. ""In rare cases, this could mean that in the event of an accident-related temporary drop in a vehicle's voltage, the communication module might not communicate the correct current position when an emergency call is made/triggered,"" a spokeswoman for the car-maker said. ""All other functions of the automatic and manual emergency call function remain fully operational,"" she added. Mercedes also said that it had discovered the fault itself due to its safety monitoring programme, which it said was a ""top priority"" for the company.",Mercedes-Benz is recalling more than one million cars over a safety defect with the cars' emergency call system.
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News Its own figures showed that, in 2015, Apple released data on users' devices to US authorities 80% of the time, compared to 55% when it came to the UK. That compared to a global average of nearly 60%, Apple's data showed. A security expert said it was ""deeply frustrating"" for law enforcement agencies. Apple released its latest transparency report on Monday to complement previous releases going back as far as 2013. It published the numbers of device requests it received - those from law enforcement for contact information and other data. Separately, it released data on account requests - those from government agencies for account details, including iTunes and iCloud account information. Data release The BBC's analysis has revealed that, similar to in 2015, the UK was below the global average and the US above it for both types of request in each of the previous years for which there were comparable data. Among the five countries that regularly submitted a large number of device requests - more than 2,000 per year - the US was the only country to consistently receive Apple customer information a greater-than-average proportion of the time. Singapore was also below the average in each of the three years. Apple's figures showed that, on average, it was unable to release data for 33% of account requests from across the world in 2015. In the US, the rate was 18% and, in the UK, 40%. A similar picture emerged in 2014. A comparison of account requests in 2013 was not possible because Apple did not release exact figures for the US for that year. The US and the UK were the only countries to make more than 300 account requests per year. The consistently lower proportion of successful requests from the UK could be because Britain is seen as ""less protective of personal privacy"" than the US, said Prof Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey. The security expert, who advises Europol and who has also advised GCHQ in the past, said: ""Whatever the reason, it is a deeply frustrating situation for law enforcement agencies."" Despite Apple's presence in many countries outside the US, he added that it may also feel less duty bound to comply with requests from foreign governments. 'Government abuse' According to Apple's report, the majority of device requests were in cases of lost or stolen phones and the BBC understands that some of the differences between countries were dependent on the differing approaches of national police forces towards phone theft. The BBC also understands that some of the unsuccessful account requests were down to the company not holding any information, rather than resisting law enforcement efforts. The firm declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. On Monday, Blackberry's chief executive John Chen said the firm would comply with law enforcement but would prevent ""government abuse of invading citizen's privacy"". He spoke in response to reports that Canadian police could intercept and read encrypted messages sent using Blackberry phones. Mr Chen said the firm ""stood by [its] lawful access principles"".","Apple is consistently more compliant with US requests for access to users' information than with the rest of the world on average, it has emerged."
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter The portrait was created after existing works by the artist were analysed by a computer. A new work was then designed to look as much like a Rembrandt as possible - while remaining an original portrait. It was then 3D-printed to give it the same texture as an oil painting. ""We really wanted to understand what makes a face look like a Rembrandt,"" Emmanuel Flores, director of technology for the project, told the BBC. After they had been digitally tagged by humans, data on Rembrandt's paintings was gathered by computers which discovered patterns in how the Dutch master would, for example, characteristically shape a subject's eyes in his portraits. Then, machine-learning algorithms were developed which could output a new portrait mirroring Rembrandt's style. To limit the many possible results to a specific type of individual, the computer was asked to produce a portrait of a Caucasian male between the ages of 30 and 40, with facial hair, wearing black clothes with a white collar and a hat, facing to the right. Algorithm artist ""We found that with certain variations in the algorithm, for example, the hair might be distributed in different ways,"" explained Mr Flores. But humans didn't decide the final look and feel of the final portrait - they simply chose algorithms based on their efficiency and let the computer come up with the finished result. Finally, a 3D texture for the painting was applied based on the height and depth of paint applied to Rembrandt's works. As this was 3D-printed, artists's brushstrokes themselves could be mimicked in the final product. ""Our goal was to make a machine that works like Rembrandt,"" said Mr Flores. ""We will understand better what makes a masterpiece a masterpiece."" However, he added, ""I don't think we can substitute Rembrandt - Rembrandt is unique."" The two-year project, entitled ""The Next Rembrandt"", was a collaboration between Microsoft, financial firm ING, Delft University of Technology and two Dutch art museums - Mauritshuis and Rembrandthuis. A public exhibition of the portrait is planned and details of the display will be released at a later date.",A team of technologists working with Microsoft and others have produced a 3D-printed painting in the style of Dutch master Rembrandt.
"Heathrow, among the world's busiest airports, was also briefly disrupted by drone activity in January. At Gatwick, incoming planes were forced to divert to airports up and down the country as the drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), repeatedly appeared over the airfield. The situation was so serious the Army was called in to support the local police in tackling the issue, with the runway finally re-opening several days later. For some time now, governments around the world have been looking at different ways of addressing the dangers of drone use in areas where they pose safety risks. Here we look at some of the solutions - ranging from bazookas to eagles. Radar and 'jamming' systems Rogue drones can be detected or located using cameras, radar and radio frequency sensors. Such technology can be integrated into existing airport systems and can have a reach of several miles. It can then be used to effectively ""jam"" the communication between a device and its operator, causing it to initiate a default mode that sends it back to where it came from. One company that has developed this method is Quantum Aviation, which provided the technology to counter possible threats from drones targeting the London 2012 Olympics. China has also developed a signal-jamming gun that can reportedly down drones from half a mile away. Shoulder-mounted 'guns' One way, and perhaps the most obvious, is to shoot them down. But police dealing with the issue at Gatwick Airport have said they will not use this method because of the risk of stray bullets. However, a number of companies have produced hand-held or shoulder-mounted devices that can be used to fire nets at rogue drones, trapping them and preventing the blades from rotating, causing them to fall from the sky. British engineering company OpenWorks has also developed a large bazooka, the SkyWall100, which fires a net and parachute at a target, using a scope for accuracy. The SkyWall100 system has been issued to security forces and government agencies in Asia, Europe and North America. Security firms have also found a way of using ""interceptor drones"" that can lock onto a target, release a net and disable it in mid-air. This type of system was deployed at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February, and has been used by police in Tokyo for the last three years. France has also used this technique, successfully demonstrating that one drone equipped with a net can catch another. Anti-drone lasers Lasers are another option: both the US and China have experimented with technology that can shoot down a device within seconds of locating it. Engineering company Boeing has developed a high-energy beam that locates and disables small drones from several miles away. It is said to use infrared cameras that can work in low visibility, such as fog. Earlier this year, China demonstrated a laser gun at a weapons exhibition in Kazakhstan. The so-called ""Silent Hunter"" was claimed to be effective in helping police intercept drones and other small aerial targets with ""high accuracy"". Specially trained eagles Meanwhile, the Netherlands has discovered a low-tech solution to the high-tech problem. Police there have trained eagles to bring down ""hostile"" drones by latching on to the propellers with their talons, instantly disabling them. Trainers say the eagles see the drones as prey and are not interested in attacking anything else when released. Dutch police are believed to be the first in the world to have implemented this method. Bans and restrictions It is already illegal to fly a drone within 1km (about 1,100 yards) of an airport or airfield boundary in the UK - but regulations in other countries vary. Drone users in the US have to notify air traffic control in advance if they plan to fly their devices within 8km of an airport. All drones must also be registered, according to the drone community website UAV Coach. In Canada, drones cannot be flown within 5.6km of any airport, seaplane base or area where aircraft can take off and land. This is reduced to 1.9km for heliports. Similar laws apply in Sweden. Permits are also required in Germany - although the restrictions for airport boundaries are similar to those in the UK, at 1.5km - and Spain, where devices must also be insured. Laws in South Africa, however, are strict. It is illegal to fly devices within 10km of an airport, helipad or airstrip, and they can only be operated elsewhere during daylight hours and in clear conditions. In 15 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, it is illegal to fly a drone at all.","Rogue drones ""deliberately"" flown over one of the UK's busiest airports caused travel chaos before Christmas."
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Its Lola B12 69/EV vehicle hit a top speed of 204.2mph (328.6km/h) at a racetrack at RAF Elvington in Yorkshire. Chief executive Lord Drayson, who was behind the wheel, said the achievement was designed to highlight electronic vehicle technology's potential. The previous 175mph record was set by Battery Box General Electric in 1974. Drayson Racing is not the only electric vehicle-maker hoping to use motorsport to spur on adoption of the technology. Last week Nissan unveiled the Zeod RC (Zero Emission On Demand Racing Car), which can switch between electric and petrol power. The firm intends to enter the vehicle into next year's Le Mans 24 race saying the competition would act as a ""challenging test bed"" for technologies that could eventually find their way into road cars. Recycled chassis Drayson Racing was founded in 2007 by self-declared ""car nut"" Paul Drayson, who was then a minister in the Labour government. The firm, based in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, works with others to develop more sustainable automotive technologies and uses motorsport competitions as a means to focus its efforts. In order to qualify for an attempt on the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA) world electric land speed record it had to make its vehicle weigh less than 1,000kg (2,204lb) without the driver. To do this it adapted a Le Mans Series car it had previously designed which originally had a bio-ethanol fuel engine and replaced the part with a lightweight 20 kilowatt hour battery offering 850 horsepower. It also adapted the vehicle's chassis, which is made out of recycled carbon fibre, to minimise air friction. ""What it, I hope, shows to people is just what the future potential of electric cars is,"" Lord Drayson told the BBC shortly after his record-breaking time was confirmed. ""Obviously this is a very special racing car, but by setting this new world record here in Britain we say two things. ""One it is a pointer to the future - the technology that we developed for this car will filter down to the cars we use every day. ""And secondly it's a message about how here in the UK we're a world leader with this technology. We've led motorsport engineering, now we're also leading with electric motorsport engineering."" Google's chairman Eric Schmidt spent two hours at the race track watching practice runs but was not able to stay for the record-setting drive. ""Google has a very active R&D programme with regard to electric vehicle technology so it's great that one of the world's leading technology companies came to our event today,"" Lord Drayson added. ""It was lovely meeting him."" Formula E Drayson Racing's attention will now switch to the launch of the FIA's Formula E championship, which is due to begin in September next year. London will host the first electric car race. Rome, Miami, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro are among the other seven locations. A different vehicle - similar to a Formula One machine - is being developed for the firm by Singapore's Spark and Surrey-based McLaren for the first year of the competition. However, Drayson Racing plans to build its own machine for the 2015 competition using some of the same components used in its record breaking Lola B12 69/EV. One analyst said such such efforts were an excellent way to promote electric cars, but questioned how many of the technologies being developed would actually find their way onto the road. ""I think that any kind of competition-led design will have spin-offs - it might be that electric motors become more efficient,"" said Paul Newton, auto analyst at IHS Global Insight. ""The problem is that making an electric car go faster is relatively straightforward. ""Making it go further and become more practical is infinitely more difficult, and that's down to the basic physics of how batteries store energy and release it.""",Drayson Racing Technologies has broken the world land speed record for a lightweight electric car.
"There have so far been three attempts to solve the long-running dispute. Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a European parliamentary committee that the next logical step would be to issue a statement of objection, including formal charges. Google said that it continued to work with the EU. The company is accused of abusing its dominant position in Europe, where it accounts for 90% of search traffic. Improvement needed The dispute has been running since 2010 when rivals, including British price-comparison site Foundem, complained about the way it displayed results. The deal suggested by Google in February was rejected after 20 formal complaints made the EU rethink its original decision to accept the proposals. Under the terms of the deal, Google agreed to reserve space near the top of its European search pages for competitors, which would be open to rivals to bid for via an auction. Rivals argued that Google's solution was unfair for a range of reasons, including the fact that Google would make money out of the changes. ""At the beginning of the month I have communicated this to the company asking them to improve these proposals,"" said Mr Almunia. ""We now need to see if Google can address these issues and allay our concerns."" He did not put a timeframe on the new proposals but acknowledged that it could be left up to the next Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker to sort out. Mr Almunia steps down in October. But, he warned, if the next set of proposals failed to impress, the next stage would be a fine. ""The next logical step is to issue a statement of objection,"" he said. Regulatory hurdles EU rules mean that a company falling foul of anti-trust laws can be fined up to 10% of its annual sales. Last year, Google's annual sales amounted to $55.5bn (£33.8bn). For its part, Google seemed in no mind to appease the EU. Writing an opinion piece for the European Commission's Digital Minds - a series of articles about the digital age written by some of the biggest players in the industry - chairman Eric Schmidt said that Europe needed to embrace disruptive industries such as Uber. ""New businesses promoting new ideas should not be held back by bureaucratic or regulatory hurdles,"" he wrote.","Google will face formal charges if it fails to come up with a suitable plan to give equal prominence to rival search engines, the EU has warned."
"Intel applied for a licence to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 computer. The Department of Commerce refused, saying it was concerned about nuclear research being done with the machine. Separately, Intel has signed a $200m (£136m) deal with the US government to build a massive supercomputer at one of its national laboratories. The Tianhe-2 uses 80,000 Intel Xeon chips to generate a computational capacity of more than 33 petaflops. A petaflop is equal to about one quadrillion calculations per second. According to the Top 500, an organisation that monitors supercomputers, the Tianhe-2 has been the world's most powerful machine for the past 18 months. This year the Chinese machine was due to undergo a series of upgrades to boost its number-crunching abilities past 110 petaflops. The upgrades would depend largely on new Intel Xeon chips. The chipmaker informed US authorities of its involvement with the upgrade programme and was told to apply for an export licence. 'In compliance' In a notice published online the US Department of Commerce said it refused Intel's application to export the chips for Tianhe-2 and three other Chinese supercomputers because the machines were being used for ""nuclear explosive activities"". The relevant section of US export regulations reveals that this covers technologies used in the ""design, development or fabrication"" of nuclear weapons. The notice added that the four institutions where the supercomputers would be located were deemed to be ""acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States"". In a statement given to the IDG news wire, the chipmaker said: ""Intel complied with the notification and applied for the licence, which was denied. We are in compliance with the US law."" China is now believed to be accelerating its own home-grown chipmaking efforts to boost the power of the four supercomputers and complete the upgrade programme. Although Intel has been denied the chance to sell its Xeon chips to China, the company has signed a large deal to build the Aurora supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. When finished that machine is expected to have a peak performance of 180 petaflops.",The US government has refused to let Intel help China update the world's biggest supercomputer.
"By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The firm said it had now lifted the ban, maintaining it was due to 17-year-old Feroza Aziz's prior conduct on the app - and unrelated to Chinese politics. Additionally, the firm said ""human moderation error"" was to blame for the video being taken down on Thursday for almost an hour. TIkTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has insisted it does not apply Chinese moderation principles to its product outside of mainland China. Ms Aziz posted on Twitter that she did not accept the firm's explanation. ""Do I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a three-part video about the Uighurs? No.” In an interview with BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis, Ms Aziz said: ""I will continue to talk about it, and I will talk about it on Twitter, on Instagram, on any platform I have, even TikTok. ""I'm not scared of TikTok, even after the suspension. I won't be scared of TikTok.” TikTok explanation Eric Han, TikTok's head of safety for the US, said Ms Aziz had been banned earlier this month after she posted a video containing an image of Osama Bin Laden. ""While we recognise that this video may have been intended as satire,"" Mr Han said, ""our policies on this front are currently strict.” When TikTok bans users, it also prevents the same device being used to set up another account. It was on a new account, set up on the same device, that Ms Aziz posted her video about the Uighurs, done in the style of a make-up tutorial, a popular genre on the network. TikTok said that account was disabled after it ran a ""platform-wide enforcement"" that locked out Ms Aziz's device, as well as 2,406 devices belonging to other users who had fallen foul of the site's policies. Mr Han wrote: ""Because the user's banned account (@getmefamousplzsir) was associated with the same device as her second account (@getmefamouspartthree), this had the effect of locking her out of being able to access her second, active account from that device. ""However, the account itself remained active and accessible, with its videos continuing to receive views.” But on Thursday morning, the viral video - which has been viewed more than nine million times, across multiple networks - was also removed from TikTok, due to what Mr Han described as a ""human moderation error”. ""It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,"" he said. ""We would like to apologise to the user for the error on our part this morning.” Rapid growth, added scrutiny Human Rights Watch told the BBC that a lack of transparency is deserving of increased scrutiny. ""It is hard for outsiders to know the real reasons for the suspension of Aziz’s account,"" said Yaqiu Wa, the non-profit's China researcher. ""TikTok does not make public the data on the videos it removes or the users it suspends, or the artificial intelligence tools it uses to determine the removals and suspensions. ""While TikTok has repeatedly stressed that it does not take orders from the Chinese government in terms of what content it promotes or removes outside of China, it has done little to quench the suspicion, given that all Chinese companies are not only accountable to its shareholders, but also to the Chinese Communist Party."" The incident marks an early, high-profile censorship dispute for TikTok, a network which has exploded in popularity over the past two years. Globally, the app has now been downloaded 1.5 billion times, according to mobile intelligence analysts Sensor Tower. It looks set to end 2019 as the third most-downloaded non-gaming app, ahead of rivals Facebook and Instagram. That surge in popularity has caused concern in Western markets, due to the nature of its Chinese ownership. In the US, TikTok's deal to buy Musical.ly, a music-based social network, is now being examined by the US Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is looking specifically at data storage and privacy practices. In February the firm was handed the largest ever fine for a US case involving children's data privacy. The company agreed to pay $5.7m (£4.3m) over its handling of data on users who were under 13, acquired thanks to its takeover of Musical.ly. _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"It means platforms such as Facebook and Twitter could be sued if they are judged to ""deceptively"" block posts. The draft of the executive order says social networks are engaged in ""selective censorship"". Mr Trump has regularly accused social-media platforms of stifling or censoring conservative voices. On Wednesday, Mr Trump accused Twitter of election interference, after it added fact-check links to two of his tweets. ""Big action to follow,"" he tweeted. What does the executive order say? The order sets out to clarify the Communications Decency Act, a US law that offers online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube legal protection in certain situations. Under Section 230 of the law, social networks are not generally held responsible for content posted by their users but can engage in ""good-Samaritan blocking"", such as removing content that is obscene, harassing or violent. And the draft of the executive order points out this legal immunity does not apply if a social network edits content posted by its users. It also says ""deceptive"" blocking of posts, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be offered immunity. Republican senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing the platforms take on the role of a ""publisher"" when they add fact-check labels to specific posts. ""The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,"" Mr Rubio said. ""But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability and treated as publishers under the law."" The draft of the executive order also calls for: How have the social networks responded? Twitter, which is repeatedly named in the draft of the executive order, declined to comment. YouTube, owned by Google, has not yet responded. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. Fox said it would play its full interview with Mr Zuckerberg on Thursday. One think tank warned the executive order could have unintended consequences. ""In the long run, this conservative campaign against social media companies could have a devastating effect on the freedom of speech,"" Matthew Feeney, of the Cato Institute, said. And changing the Communications Decency Act to ""impose political neutrality on social media companies"" could see the platforms filled with ""legal content they'd otherwise like to remove"" such as pornography, violent imagery and racism. ""Or they would screen content to a degree that would kill the free flow of information on social media that we're used to today,"" he said. Mr Feeney said the draft of the executive order was a ""mess"" but could prove politically popular in the run-up to a presidential election. What sparked the latest row? The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social-media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time. He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent."" Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"". Then, on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms. He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"". And he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"". Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally."" Mr Trump wrote a similar post about mail-in ballots on Facebook, on Tuesday, and no such warnings were applied. Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Is Twitter stifling free speech? Analysis by Christopher Giles, BBC Reality Check Twitter says it enforces its rules ""impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation"". But there is no publicly available list of which accounts have had fact-check labels or been suspended. Twitter told BBC News it had previously added fact-check labels to two tweets by Chinese government spokesman Zhao Lijian, who had speculated back in March coronavirus may have originated in the US. The company said the tweets had contained ""potentially misleading content about Covid-19 and have been labelled to provide additional context to the public"". But these labels were added retrospectively, after Twitter had been scrutinised for placing them on President Trump's posts. Twitter says common reasons for suspending accounts are abusive tweets and spam - not the censoring of political opinions. But critics say Twitter's decision-making process is opaque. And these criticisms don't just come from conservatives. Human rights groups have previously claimed Twitter has censured dissident voices and activists. In 2018, Mr Dorsey said its staff were ""more left-leaning"". But he added: ""We do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology.""",US President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order redefining the legal protections given to social media platforms.
"Foursquare, Reddit and Quora were among the sites taken offline by the glitch. Amazon EC2 is the retailer's cloud computing business.

"By Chris VallanceBBC Radio 4 The Norwegian security researcher had been drinking orange juice; now she found herself surrounded by broken glass. ""The juice was in my hair - I thought I must have hit my head and maybe I'm bleeding. It was a frightening moment."" After passing out, Marie was diagnosed with a heart problem, and had a pacemaker implanted. It sits just beneath the skin, marked by a thin white scar, a small computer that keeps her alive. Previously Marie worked for the Norwegian Computer Emergency Response Team; now she's employed by Sintef, an independent research organisation. While nations spend hundreds of millions defending critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks, Marie wonders if the computer inside her is secure and bug-free - she still hasn't been able to find the answer. It's a frustration the expert audience in the lecture theatre at the William Gates Computer building in Cambridge greeted with sympathy. She had been invited to speak by Cambridge University's Computer Security Group and the Centre for Risk Studies. The theme of her presentation was what it feels like to live with a ""vulnerable implanted device"". When Marie first had her pacemaker fitted she downloaded the manuals. She discovered it had not one, but two wireless interfaces. One enables doctors to adjust the pacemaker's settings via a near-field link. Another, slightly longer-range, connection lets the device share data logs via the internet. Hearts are now part of the Internet of Things, she realised. The first peer-reviewed paper describing an attack on a heart device that exploited these interfaces was produced by a team led by Prof Kevin Fu of the University of Michigan in 2008. They made a combination pacemaker and defibrillator deliver electric shocks, a potentially fatal hack had the device been in a patient rather than a computing lab. In 2012, security researcher Barnaby Jack demonstrated an attack using the radio-frequency interface on a heart device. Unlike Kevin Fu's work, Barnaby Jack said he was able to launch his attack from a laptop up to 50ft (15m) away. Mr Jack, who has since died, was reportedly inspired by an episode of the TV show Homeland where an attack is carried out via pacemaker. Fears of assassination by pacemaker have certainly entered the public consciousness. Former US Vice-President Dick Cheney told CBS News that in 2007 he'd had the wireless functions in an implanted heart device disabled out of concerns about security. Under the watchful eye of Simon Hansom, a cardiologist at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, a patient is being fitted with the two wires that will connect the pacemaker to their heart. There's only a little blood visible, and from behind a sterile screen a monitor shows a live X-ray of the cables moving into the body. ""To the lay person, they probably think the pacemaker has the same wireless you have at home,"" he said. ""It's not the same - it's very different,"" he said. He believes hacking is a purely theoretical risk: ""The only significant effort I've seen took a team of people two days, being within 20cm of the device, and cost around $30,000."" Prof Fu, who led that research, is less concerned than he was, ""The good news is that this model is no longer sold and the risks have been addressed,"" he told the BBC's PM programme. In general security is better. It's not a completely solved problem but businesses have ""learned quite a bit over the last seven or eight years in improving security engineering"", he said. Marie Moe is careful not to overstate the risk of hacking - she fears programming mistakes more. Not long after having her pacemaker fitted, she was climbing the stairs of a London Underground station when she started to feel extremely tired. After lengthy investigations, Marie says, a problem was found with the machine used to alter the settings of her device. To check that code is secure and bug-free, Marie would like to be able to examine the programmes that control her pacemaker. But although the pacemaker is inside her body, the vendors have not shared the code inside her pacemaker. ""It's a computer running my heart so I really have to trust this computer and it's a little bit hard for me because I don't have any way of looking into the software of this device."" Marie would like to see more third-party testing. She's a member of I Am the Cavalry, a grassroots organisation that works on cybersecurity issues affecting public safety. The challenge, according to Kevin Fu, is to find a compromise between the commercial interests of manufacturers anxious to protect their intellectual property and the needs of researchers. After her talk, Marie joins a BBC interview with cardiologist Andrew Grace at his office at Cambridge University. He retrieves an implantable defibrillator in a small plastic bag; it's about the size and shape of a jam-jar lid. 'Transformative' Marie has been able to run a half marathon thanks to her pacemaker. Andrew Grace says the devices are ""transformative""; if you need one, he and Marie agree, you shouldn't be put off by colourful cyber-assassination tales in TV dramas. But that doesn't mean security isn't important. In the summer, American regulators told hospitals to discontinue using one make of drug infusion pump because of cybersecurity concerns. Had it been an implanted device, like a pacemaker, that might have meant removing it surgically from patients. Andrew's colleague, cardiologist Simon Hansom believes security has to be a priority. The wireless aspect - ""being able to monitor people in their own homes, get up-to-the-minute checks on the devices"" - is very useful, Mr Hansom says, but the security needs to be right first time. ""It's better to know about this now and be planning the security rather than make a retrospective change.""","""I just found myself lying on the floor. I didn't know what happened,"" Marie Moe said."
"By Daniel EmeryBBC Technology reporter The region's telecoms regulator said ""BlackBerry operates beyond the jurisdiction of national legislation"" as it stores its data offshore. It said it was concerned that misuse may have ""serious social, judicial and national security repercussions"". Critics branded the moves as ""repressive"". The media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders told BBC News that while the UAE was playing a ""technological leadership role in the Arab world"" this was backed by ""repressive laws"" and a ""general trend of intensified surveillance"". ""Last April, the daily Emarat al Yaoum reported on an interior ministry plan to check the identity of anyone using the internet in public places,"" said the organisation's Lucie Morillon. Many mobile phones are already monitored, she said. Decode trouble The UAE's Telecommunications Regulatory Authority has taken issue with the encrypted networks used by Research in Motion (RIM) - the makers of the Blackberry handset. These make it difficult for governments to monitor communications. BlackBerry phones went on sale before the country introduced its safety emergency and national security legislation in 2007 ""Currently, BlackBerry operates beyond the jurisdiction of national legislation, since it is the only device operating in the UAE that immediately exports its data offshore and is managed by a foreign, commercial organisation,"" said a statement from the regulator. ""As a result of how BlackBerry data is managed and stored, in their current form, certain BlackBerry applications allow people to misuse the service, causing serious social, judicial and national security repercussions. ""Like many other countries, we have been working for a long time to resolve these critical issues, with the objective of finding a solution that operates within the boundaries of UAE law."" Research in Motion told BBC News that they had no comment to make ""at this point in time"". 'Sensitive issue' In June 2009, a separate row erupted between RIM and the state telecoms firm Etisalat after Etisalat released an ""update"" for the Blackberry handset that, said RIM, was spyware. ""Authorities tried to install spyware on smartphones in July 2009, but users raised such an uproar that they finally abandoned the plan,"" said Ms Morillon. Etisalat is a major telecommunications firm based in the UAE, with 145,000 BlackBerry users on its books. Ms Morillon said there had been a long running campaign to monitor Blackberry transmissions by the UAE authorities. ""There is in particular a very aggressive campaign against the Blackberry messenger, that has become a very popular tool amongst different generations in UAE,"" she said. ""This is where some sensitive issues are discussed, such as official corruption or when the UAE increased the price of the Oil. ""The latest development appears as one more way to go after the personal data of Blackberry's users, by a regime more and more obsessed by monitoring its citizens,"" she added. While 50% of the UAE's population has some kind of internet access, authorities have imposed extensive filtering on what they can view. Although the government says it is required to fight online pornography, other subject that fall foul of the filtering laws include sites criticising the UAE's human rights record, discussions on the economy and - according to Reporters Without Borders - sites expressing ""non-orthodox opinions about Islam"".","The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has said that it could move to restrict or monitor BlackBerry mobile phones, as they pose a ""national security risk""."
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The component was made using the same ""five nanometre"" process as its US rival's chip, but contains billions more transistors. As a result, the Chinese firm claims its phones are more powerful. However, Huawei has had its supply of the chips cut off because of a US trade ban that came into effect in September. That means that once its stockpile of the new Kirin 9000 processors runs out, it faces being unable to make more of the Mate 40 handsets in their current form. At present, only Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung have the expertise and equipment to manufacture 5nm chips, and both are forbidden to supply Huawei with them or any other semiconductor product whose creation involves ""US technology and software"". The States says the move has been taken on national security grounds, but Huawei denies posing a threat. The BBC asked how many of the chips Huawei had purchased, but it declined to answer. However, in a online presentation, the company's consumer devices chief Richard Yu acknowledged the ban was ""making the situation extremely difficult for us"". Huawei also faces other earlier restrictions placed on it by Washington, which have prevented any of the devices it has launched since mid-2019 from providing access to some of Google's services, including its Play Store. Despite this, Huawei remains the world's third-bestselling smartphone-maker, and the market leader in its home country. ""In China, Huawei has phenomenal brand awareness in the premium space,"" commented Mo Jia, an analyst at tech research firm Canalys. ""Demand for the Mate 40 series is expected to be strong [there], but despite this, amid US sanctions, component constraints may limit the total quantity of new Kirin-powered smartphones Huawei can produce."" Smooth screens The basic Mate 40 model - which Huawei said costs €899 ($1,049; £800) - has a 6.5in (16.5cm) OLED display. Three more expensive versions - ranging in price up to €2,295 - have 6.8in OLED screens. In each case, the screens offer a 90Hz refresh rate - meaning the equivalent of 90 frames per second - which is higher than Apple's newest iPhones but less than Samsung's S20 series. Mr Yu suggested this offered the best balance of smoothness and battery life. One of the main ways the different models are differentiated are by their cameras: For the time being, the firm only plans to put the Pro model on sale outside China, where it will cost £1,100. One of the innovations detailed was the use of a ""free-form lens"" for the ultra-wide angle camera found on each model, which Huawei said solved image distortion problems. The firm added that an optional ""eyes-on-device"" feature - which only turns on the screen when it detects being looked at - would reduce the power the handset consumes. Absent apps Huawei said the Kirin 9000 chip includes an integrated 5G modem, which enables it to extend battery life beyond its rivals. One slide displayed at the launch claimed the Mate 40 Pro would last about 25% longer on a single charge than Samsung's Note 20 Ultra+, despite the latter having a bigger battery. Huawei said it was also using the extra processing power to take slow-motion shots at 240 frames per second from two of the cameras simultaneously. The firm also boasted that the chip allows its devices to offer a ""pro-gaming"" experience, thanks to its ability to offer graphics with better detail and lighting effects. However, some titles including Call of Duty Mobile will not work on the devices because of their lack of access to some of Google's technologies, while some others function but are unable to make in-app payments. Most Android apps can be installed via the Petal search tool even if they do not appear in Huawei's own app store. However, there are notable exceptions. Many banking apps, eBay and the UK's Tesco Groceries app will not install, and instead the user is provided with an icon that instead launches their websites. The Sky News app is also unavailable, although Huawei said it was coming soon. ""Clearly politics has brought about a situation where Huawei is now working hard to become non-reliant upon Google to offer consumers an alternative,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""Surely what Huawei is doing with its App Gallery - albeit a work in progress - deserves praise."" If an app is unavailable, users can add it to a ""wish list"" and Huawei says the developer will be told if there is strong demand. But one expert questioned whether most consumers would be happy with the current arrangement. ""The new chip is impressive and the circular camera design on the rear distinctive, but despite Huawei's best efforts to build up its App Gallery, there are still significant gaps,"" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""Even with the Petal search capability, you still have this challenge that you have to find the applications and then side-load them onto the device. That's all very well for tech-savvy, committed Huawei enthusiasts, but for the mass market, it's a pretty big barrier to put in people's way.""","Huawei has unveiled its Mate 40 smartphones claiming they feature a more ""sophisticated"" processor than Apple's forthcoming iPhones."
