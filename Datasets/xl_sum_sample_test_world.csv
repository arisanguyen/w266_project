"The deal will see the number of US troops in Poland rise to about 5,500. Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said the number could quickly be increased to 20,000 if a threat justified it. US President Donald Trump has previously accused Germany of not contributing enough to Nato. But the US move has raised concern among Nato allies worried over possible Russian expansionism. The Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement (EDCA) was signed by Mr Pompeo and Mr Blaszczak in Warsaw on Saturday. ""This is going to be an extended guarantee - a guarantee that in case of a threat our soldiers are going to stand arm-in-arm,"" Poland's President Andrzej Duda said at the signing ceremony. ""It will also serve to increase the security of other countries in our part of Europe."" About 4,500 US troops are currently stationed in Poland and another 1,000 will be added under the new pact. The headquarters of the US Army V Corps will also be relocated from Germany to Poland. Last month the US confirmed that almost 12,000 troops - out of more than 38,000 - would be withdrawn from Germany in what it described as a ""strategic"" repositioning of its forces in Europe. About 6,400 troops are being sent home with the rest moved to other Nato countries including Poland, Italy and Belgium. President Trump said the move was a response to Germany failing to meet Nato targets on defence spending. 'Muscular' Poland is Trump's kind of ally Billed by its advocates as a means to better defend Nato and strengthen deterrence against Moscow, this new military agreement could be as much about politics as it is about strategy. The US already contributes to and commands a small multi-national Nato battlegroup in Poland, with regular exercises drawing in additional forces. A land-based ballistic missile defence system is under construction. But since 2018 in particular, Polish politicians have been pushing for much more, at one stage arguing that a full US division should be permanently based in the country with Warsaw shouldering at least some of the cost; a plan dubbed by some as ""Fort Trump"". The new agreement falls well short of this. But it sends a clear signal about Mr Trump's preferences. Muscular Poland, with relatively strong defence spending, is the sort of ally the president likes. By contrast he has already announced the pull-out of some US forces from Germany, which he believes does not carry its share of the defence burden. It is not clear that the shifting around of forces will necessarily strengthen Nato at a time when many of its key problems seem to relate to internal cohesion. ""We don't want to be the suckers any more,"" Mr Trump told reporters shortly after the move was announced. ""We're reducing the force because they're not paying their bills; it's very simple."" Mr Trump has long complained that European Nato members should spend more on their own defence and not rely so heavily on the US to shoulder the costs of maintaining the alliance. The row between the allies focuses around the target agreed by all Nato members that defence spending should reach 2% of GDP (gross domestic product, the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country) by 2024. Germany, along with other countries, has yet to meet this target. German officials have criticised the US move, suggesting it could weaken Nato and embolden Russia.",US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has signed a new defence agreement with Poland that will see American troops redeployed there from Germany.
"A former Portuguese prime minister and head of the UN refugee agency, he was the Security Council's unanimous choice. A final decision will be made in a formal vote at the council before going to the General Assembly. But despite Mr Guterres' breadth of appeal and experience, many had hoped the top job would go to a woman. Out of 13 candidates, seven were women; some arguably even more experienced than Mr Guterres. Female contenders in the race included the former prime minister of New Zealand, the director general of cultural agency Unesco, the Moldovan deputy prime minister and a senior EU official. In August, the outgoing UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, said it was ""high time"" for a female head, after more than 70 years of the UN and eight male leaders. But those who wanted to see a woman elected were disappointed by Wednesday's result, calling it a ""disaster for gender equality"". The Campaign to Elect a Woman UN Secretary-General, a group of mostly academics who supported the female candidates up for nomination, called it an ""outrage"". ""There were seven outstanding female candidates and in the end it appears they were never seriously considered,"" the campaigners said in a statement. One of the contenders, Christiana Figueres, a key architect of the global climate change agreement signed in Paris last year, called the result ""bittersweet"". So was the election sexist? Some of the candidates have said gender was a factor. Susana Malcorra, Argentina's foreign minister, complained last month that women did not have a chance in the Security Council. ""It's not a glass ceiling; it's a steel ceiling,"" she said, according to Foreign Policy magazine. On Wednesday, after congratulating her rival on his win on Twitter, Ms Malcorra went on to say that gender remains an issue in the election of a secretary general. But other candidates downplayed the role of sexism or gender in the race. Helen Clark, New Zealand's former prime minister, told the Guardian: ""If you're asking whether women are being discriminated against - no. ""There are a lot of factors swirling around. There is east-west, there is north-south, there's the style of what's wanted in the job. Do they want strong leadership? Do they want malleable? It's all cross-cutting and we don't know what will come in the wash."" What are some of the ""swirling factors""? Some say that, whether you are a male or female candidate, politicking and so-called backroom deals are the biggest factors in determining who is finally nominated. The Woman SG Campaign said in its statement that this week's result ""represents the usual backroom deals that still prevail at the UN"". The UN Association in the UK detailed on its website some of the closed-door deals that go on in the UN Security Council. ""One of the most visible types of backroom deals was articulated by UN inspectors in 2011 when they wrote that 'no Secretary-General had been immune to political pressure' to reserve certain top UN jobs for certain member states. ""This refers to the unfortunate practice of major powers extracting promises from candidates in return for their support."" Politico highlighted the importance of these dealings as heavyweights like Russia and the US hold immense power to stop a candidacy. ""Whoever wins the race will have had to carefully negotiate the support (or at least avoid the opposition) of both the United States and Russia."" There is no suggestion that any backroom deals were made over the election of Mr Guterres. Indeed, Samantha Power, the US representative to the UN, described the result as ""remarkably"" uncontroversial, calling him a candidate ""whose experience, vision, and versatility across a range of areas proved compelling"". But it is clear that if a woman is to be elected to the UN's top job next time, it is not just sexism she will have to overcome.",Antonio Guterres has emerged as the likely man to become next UN secretary general.
"Although oil is said to account for 75% of the Nigerian economy, no-one knows how much the country actually produces or refines because hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil are stolen every day, at each level of the supply chain. President Buhari has taken personal control of the oil ministry and split the state-owned NNPC oil company into two entities in a move aimed at reducing corruption. Four experts talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the challenge he faces. Kolawole Banwo: Oil theft 'at industrial scale' Kolawole Banwo is a senior programme officer at Nigeria's Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre. ""We do not have an independent metering facility to measure the quantity of oil that is extracted. ""We are not able to know the figures, [but] as at 2014, Nigeria could have been losing 300,000 barrels a day; about $12bn (Â£8bn) annually. That's a sizeable part of our budget. ""We can hardly afford to pay basic salaries and fund our budget because oil is being stolen. Considering we have the highest number of out-of-school children all over the world; the highest risk of maternal mortality; decaying infrastructure, and about 60% of our population live in poverty, it's very shocking indeed. ""Some of these pipelines were built in the 60s and 70s, so they are not strong. They are on the surface, they are rusted. ""Breaking through them is not difficult. In the dead of night in deep creeks where it's difficult to have proper security, they are able to siphon the crude into smaller boats and ships with drums and barrels to convey it further into the forest in the coastal waters where they already have refineries. ""You have smaller vessels that actually get these things to bigger vessels that can go on the high seas. That is very sophisticated and can only happen when you have high-powered individuals who can afford a crew and have the connection to a buyer. ""You need some form of high-powered conspiracy to do that. We call it oil theft at industrial scale. ""The very volatile nature of the Niger Delta came from an area of militancy and effort has still been made to pacify the population and not to exact too much force. But there are many who may benefit from the outputs and so give cover to these people because in the end their interest is tied to it."" Dauda Garuba: People need to benefit from oil revenues Dauda Garuba is Nigeria officer at the Natural Resource Governance Institute. ""If oil is the cash cow of Nigeria, nothing will be too much a price to get the situation right. ""We need to have a multi-face meter that measures the quantity of oil at the level of the well head, at the level of the flow station, and at the level of export terminals. ""People have an 'I don't care' attitude to what is happening, because if the oil is taken by the community or by thieves, it doesn't matter to them, because nothing comes to them in terms of development. ""They don't get anything for the oil that is taken from their territories. To get oil theft addressed, one of the things we might consider is getting the community involved. ""Over the years, the refineries have not been maintained. And a lot of persons have gotten rich through corruption on the basis of this."" Idayat Hassan: Corruption in Nigeria is endemic Idayat Hassan is director of the Centre for Democracy and Development in Abuja. ""Corruption in the Nigerian context is endemic, because it permeates all stratas of the society. You can find corruption everywhere you actually dig into in the daily life activities of Nigerians. ""When building hospitals and schools it's the norm that contractors in Nigeria get contracts, and then either don't implement them all, or they do what we call 'contract splitting', so people split the money and go away, and the hospital or school doesn't get built at all. ""Who are the key players in the oil industry? Most of them are also involved in other parts of the economy. So you find somebody is actually in oil, but is also in banking, at the same time he's in manufacturing, he is in various parts of the economy of Nigeria. ""There is also a linkage to politics, because if they are not in active politics, don't forget that they are the financiers of the politicians. ""It's a very, very difficult task, really, for President Buhari. He will also have to take on people that are part of his political party, really. ""Most of the people that have been accused of corruption are normally let off. So, for instance, there are charges filed against somebody for stealing 10 billion Naira (US$100m, Â£65m) - a mindboggling amount. At the end of the case, after five years, this accused person is let off the hook because there is corruption in the judicial sector. One way or another, justice is not dispensed. ""It will actually be impossible for President Buhari to do this. Saying he will end corruption itself is a mirage. ""It's a long, long-term initiative. It's collectively Nigerians who will have to deal with the issue of corruption, or else we may all end up disappointed together."" Mansur Liman: Buhari could be the man to solve this Mansur Liman is the head of the BBC Hausa service. ""I think he's in a very good position to tackle what is happening. People who remember him as the head of state of Nigeria when he toppled a civilian government in the 1980s remember him as someone who didn't tolerate any nonsense. ""It was a dictatorship. He arrested many politicians that were accused of corruption and locked them up without any trial. The musician Fela Kuti was arrested for criticising the military government. ""He introduced something called 'War Against Indiscipline'. People did not queue in Nigeria; Buhari made it law to queue because that is the proper thing to do - first come, first served. ""The popular support that he enjoys at this moment was because of what he did as the military then. If Nigerians are looking for someone who is ready and willing and has the capacity to fight corruption, I think the name of Buhari will be top. ""I think it's the way he conducts himself, the way he insulates himself from all the corruption that's been taking place in the country. He declared his own assets recently and you could see he had about 30 million Naira (US$145,000, Â£94,000) in his own bank account. ""This is not a lot of money in the Nigerian context: there are many people who have held posts that are much lower than he has held and who have much more money. ""When he was elected as the president, there were many rich people who were trying to get an audience with him - carrying lots of things to his house. And he turned them back. This is the kind of person that you're talking about."" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST.

"Deputy Darren Duquemin criticised the department after the 2011 States' accounts revealed it had let its office budget grow by 48% over five years. In the same period, spending on schools and teaching rose by less than 10%. Jon Buckland, the department's chief officer, confirmed the figures but said the increase was ""actually being spent on education"". He said: ""It's all about the education development project which is about making sure we have the right premises and facilities for young people."" Deputy Duquemin accused the department of wasting taxpayers' money on bureaucracy. However, Mr Buckland said: ""It's important to stress that the education office is still less than 6% of our total budget [of Â£75.2m]"".",Guernsey's Education Department has rejected a claim that it is spending too much money on administration costs.
"Many of them are non-Muslim civil servants who are demanding that the government evacuate them from the region, a BBC reporter says. Al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab gunmen killed 28 people in a bus attack on Saturday. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta is under growing pressure to end attacks by the group. Al-Shabab is based in neighbouring Somalia, but has stepped up attacks in Kenya since 2011, when Kenya sent troops across the border to help battle the militants. The BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri, in Nairobi, says the opposition and some ruling party MPs are calling for an overhaul of Kenya's security agencies, including the dismissal of Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku and police chief David Kimaiyo. 'In danger' About 100 people protested in Nairobi on Tuesday, chanting ""Mr President, we demand security."" Mr Ole Lenku has flown to the restive Mandera region in an attempt to allay the concerns of people, our reporter says. There are no reports of a specific threat, but many people in Mandera are worried that al-Shabab could strike again, especially as the festive season approaches, he adds. Six unions - including those representing doctors, teachers and civil servants - have advised members to leave until security forces can ensure their safety. The call could affect more than 10,000 teachers and 16,500 civil servants in major towns such as Mandera, Wajir and Garissa, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reports. ""Their lives are clearly in danger,"" Kenya Union of Teachers leader Wilson Sossion is quoted as saying. ""We have already lost enough members of the teaching force and can't risk any further,"" he added. Our reporter says 20 of the 28 killed in the bus attack were teachers who were returning to their homes for the Christmas holidays, following the closure of schools. 'Retaliation' Many of the teachers, doctors and government officials who work in Mandera are from other parts of Kenya and no longer want to stay in the north-east, which borders Somalia and has been badly affected by al-Shabab's insurgency, our correspondent adds. Hundreds of people have left their homes with their belongings and are now camping at the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) airstrip, demanding that they be given safe passage out of Mandera, he says. Deputy President William Ruto has said the military has killed more than 100 al-Shabab militants linked to the bus attack. The armed forces carried out two operations in Somalia, destroying equipment and a camp from which the bus attack was planned, he said. However, al-Shabab has denied this, and says its fighters were safe. In Saturday's attack, gunmen pulled non-Muslim passengers from a bus in northern Kenya, killing 28 of them. Al-Shabab said it carried out the assault in retaliation for a government crackdown on mosques in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa allegedly used by extremists.

"By Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service Last December in Paris, countries agreed to cut emissions in a bid to keep the global average rise in temperatures below 2C. The Paris deal is the world's first comprehensive climate agreement. It also says signatories will strive to limit warming to 1.5C, a more ambitious goal, demanded by poor and very vulnerable countries. Scientists have warned that warming above 2C will result in dangerous climate change, leading to a rise in sea levels, floods and landslides, droughts and wildfires, among other disasters. India ratifies Paris climate deal The world has already become 1C warmer since industrialisation began. Scientists blame this on greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. Dangerous gases The emitted gases, mainly carbon dioxide, are said to be dangerously concentrating in the atmosphere, which traps in the heat from the sun and causes climatic changes. The Paris climate agreement needs to be ratified by countries accounting for at least 55% of global emissions before it can come into force. Sixty one countries, accounting for nearly 48% of total greenhouse gas emissions have already ratified the agreement., India's ratification will now take that figure close to the threshold, as the country accounts for nearly 7% of the world's emissions. UN officials have said the agreement is set to become a law by the end of this year. The progress with this agreement has been quite remarkable compared to the Kyoto protocol, the first treaty to cut down carbon emissions. Although it was signed in 1997, it came into force only in 2005 and has now been more or less phased out. India is the world's third largest carbon emitter after China and the US - both of whom have already ratified the Paris agreement. In terms of per capita emissions however, it is 10th on the list, as its emissions are less than 2.5 tonnes per capita. The US tops this list with nearly 20 tonnes per capita. Delhi has also pledged to reduce the rate of its emissions by up to 35% by 2030. Under a voluntary plan submitted to the UN climate convention, it says it will work on sourcing 40% of its electricity needs from non-fossil fuel sources, and listed solar and wind as its first two options. However, Delhi's plans to also double annual production of coal - the dirtiest of fossil fuels - to more than one billion tonnes remains a very controversial issue. Like other fast emerging economies, India has argued that it needs the cheap fossil-fuelled energy to pursue development work, and is therefore asking already developed countries to make deeper emission cuts. But, developed countries have said that rapidly developing countries like China and India will also need to make big reductions in their emissions for a global climate agreement to actually work. The Paris deal is largely legally non-binding and it is yet to have a mechanism to verify which country has actually cut emissions by how much. Unless that is secured, critics say, the agreement will remain on paper only. Paris agreement: Key points",India's ratification of the Paris global climate agreement on Sunday comes nearly a year after it was signed by 191 countries in the French capital.
"Several suicide bombings struck in and around the government-held city of Suweida - the main city in the province - on Wednesday. The Islamic State group (IS) said it carried out the attacks. Pro-government forces were later reported to be engaged in gun battles with IS militants east of the city. The Syrian government, backed by Russia, recently launched a campaign to retake the remaining rebel-held areas across the south of the country. Wednesday's wave of attacks was the deadliest on government-held territory in months, correspondents say. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported a string of suicide blasts in Suweida, south of the capital Damascus, and in villages to the north and east. It said militants also stormed homes in the villages and killed the occupants. It said at least 221 people had been killed, 127 of them civilians. ""It's the bloodiest death toll in Suweida province since the start of the war [in 2011],"" observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP news agency. The Suweida health authority told pro-government radio station Sham FM that 215 people had been killed and 180 injured. State news agency Sana earlier reported one suicide attack at a market in Suweida and said security forces had killed two other attackers before they could blow themselves up. Militants also attacked three villages north-east of the city, it said. State TV also said government forces were ""targeting positions of the Daesh [IS] terrorist group"" in countryside to the east of Suweida. Suweida governor Amer al-Eshi told state-run Ikhbariyah TV that the city was now ""secure and calm"". Over the past year, IS has lost most of the land it once held across Syria and neighbouring Iraq. At the peak of its power, around 10 million people lived in IS-controlled areas, but the US military said earlier this year that the jihadist group had been ousted from 98% of its former territory. In Syria, the group is still present in small pockets in the southern provinces of Suweida and Deraa, as well as parts of the country's east. What is happening elsewhere in the country? The Syrian military, backed by Russian forces, recently launched an operation to drive rebels from their remaining strongholds in the south-west. On Wednesday, Russia-backed government forces were also reported to be bombarding pockets of IS-held territory in Deraa, west of Suweida. At least 270,000 people have fled their homes in the region as fighting continues, the UN says. On Sunday, Israel allowed the evacuation of hundreds of White Helmets civil defence workers who were trapped in a war zone in southern Syria. The Syrian government condemned the move, describing it as a ""criminal operation"" by Israel and others.","At least 215 people have died in a series of apparently co-ordinated attacks in south-western Syria, local officials and a monitoring group say."
"Uber will get a 9.99% stake in the Indian start-up, helping it maintain its presence in the sector. All Uber Eats customers in India will now be redirected to Zomato but it's unclear if the acquisition will cause lay-offs. The deal is likely to give Zomato an edge over its rival Swiggy in a fast-growing but fiercely-contested sector. Zomato operates in more than 500 cities in India and the firm believes that the acquisition will further consolidates its presence. ""We are proud to have pioneered restaurant discovery and to have created a leading food delivery business across India. This acquisition significantly strengthens our position in the category,"" Deepinder Goyal, Founder and CEO of Zomato, said. Uber Eats launched in India in 2017 with a promise to revolutionise the sector. The San Francisco-based company has since been trying to increase its customer base, but faced tough competition from Zomato and Swiggy. Darshini Kansara, an analyst with CARE Ratings, said that Swiggy and Zomato both had a better grip on the Indian market. ""Even though Uber Eats had the advantage of 'global experience', the Indian market is very different from a developed market - the price points and strategies. Other factors like having an interactive app where customers can post photographs and review food items, and tie-ups with restaurants gave Zomato and Swiggy an edge."" Uber said India would continue to be its priority. ""India remains an exceptionally important market to Uber and we will continue to invest in growing our local rides business, which is already the clear category leader,"" Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO, said. Correspondents say the deal will further intensify the competition between Zomato and Swiggy. The fight for India's food delivery market Suranjana Tewari, BBC News, Mumbai Food delivery services have become integral to daily life in India. Corporate professionals rely on aggregators to deliver their lunch at work every day - restaurants and kitchens have been able to expand their customer base considerably as a result and tens of millions of people across the country have become accustomed to getting their favourite meal delivered directly to their doorstep every day. With a cab aggregator service already firmly established in the country, and a large population, Uber's entry into the Indian food delivery market was a no brainer. But the parent company was under pressure to reduce loss-making businesses since going public last May, and Uber Eats was bleeding money. This is the latest sale for Uber after it exited businesses in Russia, China and Southeast Asia in recent years. So, why is the Indian market so competitive? It is crowded with indigenous apps such as Zomato and Swiggy that were already operating in hundreds of towns and cities across India. They had attracted a strong customer base to their extensive catalogue of restaurant partners. But their real appeal was deep discounts, a must for the Indian customer. Zomato has run into a lot of controversy regarding its offers but for now, it seems to have given the startup an edge. The fight for India's food delivery market is now pretty much a duopoly between Zomato, backed by Alibaba, and Swiggy, which is backed by another Chinese tech giant - Tencent. But all is not lost for Uber. By retaining a stake in Zomato, it'll ride the wave of success the Indian startup is enjoying - but as a backer, rather than a loss-making rival.","Uber has sold its food delivery service in India to local rival Zomato, the firms have announced."
"Authorities believe the disease, which is treatable with antibiotics, was spread by squirrels and fleas. The tourist's camp site - the Tuolumne Meadows Campground - will be closed until Friday as workers treat the area with insecticide. A California child fell ill last month, but has recovered. The latest suspected case is a person from Georgia who visited the Sierra National Forest in early August, but officials did not give further details. Symptoms of the plague include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin. If left untreated, the disease can be fatal. There are three main types of plague depending on how the infection manifests. The bubonic plague is characterised by swollen lymph nodes. Pneumonic plague affects the respiratory system. It becomes septicaemic if it is found in the bloodstream. The infected child showed signs of all three types, the state health department said. Since 1970, 40 cases of plague have been reported in California, and nine people have died from the disease. Health officials commonly find plague-infected animals but human cases are relatively rare.

"By Rob WatsonUK political correspondent, BBC World Affairs Unit As the conversations between the monarch and prime minister are private, we don't know whether Her Majesty might have been somewhat fed up, given that it was just weeks ago that she opened a new parliamentary session with all its usual pageantry. On that occasion the Queen had supposedly set out the plans of Mr Johnson's, in retrospect, decidedly short-lived government. If you are wondering why an election is even being held after the Queen went to all that trouble of opening parliament, and another election would otherwise have been due in the summer of 2022, here's why. The official reason given by Mr Johnson is a fear that the last parliament simply would never have passed the Brexit deal he had agreed with the European Union. It's also clear, though, that Mr Johnson thought it unlikely the Conservative party would ever be lucky enough again to be up against an opponent as unpopular as the current leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. Recent polls suggest the Labour leader has the lowest satisfaction rating for an opposition leader since the 1970s. Why did the opposition parties agree to an election? In truth, the Labour party had little choice, once smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP) decided to try their luck - possibly believing that their stance as out-and-out anti-Brexit parties was likely to play well with a large chunk of voters. Now the battle is commenced, it's not hard to see the shape of the battlefield. Just consider the campaign slogans from the main parties, which are hardly subtle - are campaign slogans ever? But it hasn't exactly been the smoothest of starts for any of the main parties as General Election 2019 (#GE2019) gets under way. What's gone wrong so far? Even before Mr Johnson's first rally in front of the party faithful on Wednesday, he had lost a government minister - the first minister to be forced to resign during a campaign in over 40 years. Meanwhile, another minister - the famously posh-sounding and wealthy Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg - had to apologise after suggesting that many of the mainly poor victims of the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked common sense when following the fire service's advice to stay in their apartments. And, as if all that wasn't bad enough, Conservative Party headquarters created fake news by editing an interview with a Labour politician in a misleading way before posting it on social media. Perhaps less reported on, but most seriously of all, the week brought further retirements and resignations of ""moderate"" Conservative MPs unhappy at what they saw as the party's undoubted shift to the right and emergence as an out-and-out pro-Brexit party. Labour's campaign start was similarly disastrous, with the deputy leader stepping down and two former party figures accusing Mr Corbyn of being unfit to lead the country, citing what they said was his total failure to tackle the party's anti-Semitism problem and his far left anti-Western world view. Economists have also been fairly scathing about the promise of a vast increase in public spending at the heart of the Labour offer of a genuinely ""real change"" socialist alternative following nine years of Tory austerity. What have we learned so far? The early stage of campaigning has effectively highlighted how both the main parties have moved off to the ideological right and left and away from being the largely centrist broad coalitions they had been for so many years. How much any of this registers with the voters is hard to say. The parties no doubt hope that voters just pick up on, or ""cut through"" as it's known, their core message, whether that's Brexit or something else. But if the campaigns so far have failed to really take off, there's one thing perhaps all the politicians can agree on, namely that this is surely one of the most important elections in this country since 1945. At stake is not just Britain's future relationship with the EU, but its very standing in the world, the nature of its economic model and the very unity of the United Kingdom, given possible developments in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The stakes don't come higher than this.","And they're off. At 00:01 on Wednesday, the UK Parliament was dissolved. Hours later, the Conservative leader and Prime Minister Boris Johnson made the short visit to Buckingham Palace to inform Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the election was now on."
"By David ChazanBBC News, Bordeaux, France But this chateau, south-east of Bordeaux, is also at the cutting edge of Asia's growing economic might. The staff who tend the vineyards and make the wine are still French, but this is now a Chinese-owned domain. It has been taken over by the Longhai group based in eastern China, which has created a subsidiary to run it called Chateau Latour-Laguens (Qingdao). The Chinese are developing a new taste for French wines these days. And in addition to buying them by the bottle or the case, the Chinese have also started buying the vineyards where their favourite Bordeaux vintages are produced. Chateau Latour-Laguens was the first estate in Bordeaux to be bought by Chinese investors three years ago, but at least five others are now also Chinese-owned. ""We're looking for the know-how, French technology and culture,"" said Yilain Xu of Chateau Latour-Laguens (Qingdao). ""Bordeaux is a famous place to make high-quality wine and in China we have more and more people who drink wine, as lifestyles are changing."" The new owners of Chateau Latour-Laguens have invested in the latest wine-making technology, and are renovating the chateau itself, which was somewhat run down before they took over. But they have been careful to keep the French workers, and have hired an experienced French oenologist, or expert in the science of winemaking, to manage the operation and improve the quality of the wine. Planting in China But Chinese companies are not just investing here in Bordeaux, they are also developing winemaking in China, which is now the world's seventh largest producer. They are even creating chateaux and vineyards that look just like the ones here in France. It is perhaps no accident that Longhai is based in a part of China where the climate is similar to that of Bordeaux. Much to the astonishment of European experts, a wine made in China recently won a major international award in the Bordeaux category, beating its French rivals in a blind tasting. That has made some Bordeaux wine growers worried about the future. French wine growers say that one of the determining factors in the distinctive quality of their wine is their soil, ""le terroir"". But news of the prize-winning wine from China is starting to shake some of the old certainties. ""It's the small, struggling chateaux that foreigners are buying so we're not too worried for now,"" said Didier Cousiney, whose family have been wine-growers for generations. ""But we are afraid that it could be a problem in the future if it happens on a large scale, especially if the buyers are from countries like China where they're making high quality wines and could produce enormous quantities."" Huge potential But Chinese investors are planning to buy more estates in Bordeaux, and are also now looking at the possibility of acquiring bigger, better-known vineyards. And yet not everyone in Bordeaux is worried. Estate agent Daniel Carmagnat arranged the sale of Latour Laguens, and said the nascent Chinese market is potentially so big that there is room for everyone. ""The Chinese market is huge and it's growing very fast, so as the Chinese drink more wine, that will be enough for both French and Chinese producers,"" he said. ""The Chinese recognise the quality of our wine and they prefer Bordeaux,"" he said. ""Other regions in France also produce very good wines, but for them it's just Bordeaux."" Wine growers in Bordeaux are grateful that prices have shot up thanks to the explosion of Chinese consumption. Lean years Mr Cousiney said it happened as many producers were struggling after a series of lean years. ""The French are drinking less wine and there's a lot of competition from the so-called New World wines from Australia, South Africa and the South American countries,"" he said. ""If it's better now, it's because of emerging markets like China, Brazil and Russia. We hope that will continue but we don't know how long it will last."" It is difficult for wine producers in Bordeaux to increase production because land is limited and there is only one harvest a year. So the leading winemakers here are investing heavily to improve quality. They know that the challenge they will face in the future will be making sure that no matter how well their Chinese rivals copy them, fine French wines retain a certain je ne sais quoi.","With its fairytale turrets and a 15th-Century tower, Chateau Latour Laguens is surrounded by vineyards in a region steeped in European tradition."
"The California senator's campaign seemed full of promise when it launched in January, but she struggled to make headway in a crowded field. In November her cash-strapped operation laid off staff at its Baltimore HQ, in New Hampshire and in her home state. The 55-year-old, a fierce critic of President Donald Trump, was once seen as a rising star within the party. But she could not cement her fleeting position in the top tier of candidates alongside Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Ms Harris entered the race as a leading contender, launching her bid for the White House to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland, California, at the beginning of the year. She reached double-digits in the polls after attacking Mr Biden on the issue of race during a live TV debate in June, but began to lag in recent months. ""I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,"" Ms Harris said in an email to supporters on Tuesday. ""My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue. ""I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete."" She held a conference call with staff earlier in the day to inform them of her decision. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, tweeted a message of support to her after the announcement. After a tweet by President Trump appeared to mock her departure from the race, Ms Harris responded with a scathing tweet referencing his possible impeachment trial in the Senate. On Tuesday, a Democrat-led investigation in the House of Representatives said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence to impeach Mr Trump for misconduct in office. However no formal charges have yet been laid. Mr Biden was among those who paid tribute to his former rival. He said: ""My reaction is she is a first-rate intellect, a first-rate candidate."" He added: ""I have mixed emotions about it because she is really a solid, solid person, and loaded with talent. ""I'm sure she's not dropping out on wanting to make the changes she cares about."" Other candidates were also quick to pay tribute. Ms Harris, a former San Francisco attorney-general, had already qualified for the next round of Democratic debates, to be held later this month in her home state. But polling showed her in the single digits in national surveys as well as those conducted in early-voting states. After initially raising $12m in the first three months of her campaign, she failed to harness momentum. Lofty expectations lead to dashed hopes January's launch event in Oakland felt like the beginning of something big - a presidential campaign with money, national organisation and a young, charismatic candidate whose background was as diverse as the party she wanted to lead. The former state attorney general and prosecutor from nearby San Francisco gave a speech full of lofty rhetoric, saying that the 2020 presidential election would be about the ""right to moral leadership"" of the entire planet. Now her campaign won't be around to see 2020, let alone the November general election. Pundits and analysts are already picking apart Harris's campaign strategy and perceived missteps over the past months. She tried to walk a line between the moderate and the progressive wings of her party and ended up appealing to neither. She squandered her surge to near-front-runner status after a clash with Joe Biden in the June debate with muddled responses to questions on healthcare policy. Her subsequent debate performances were lacklustre. She initially ignored, then made a belated push, to campaign in first-voting Iowa. At 55, Harris still has a long political career ahead of her. She would be an attractive vice-presidential pick for a candidate like Biden. While her first foray into national politics will be largely remembered for unmet expectations and missed opportunities, she has plenty of time for a second act. Read more from Anthony Pundits noted how Ms Harris' original campaign slogan ""for the people"" - a reference to her career as a prosecutor - failed to attract support from younger, more progressive voters. She took on a new slogan, her ""3a.m. agenda"" - referencing the issues that keep voters awake at night - but that also failed to attract support leading her to return to her prosecutorial roots with the phrase ""justice is on the ballot"". Her record as a prosecutor drew scrutiny from the left-wing of her party, despite her efforts to label herself a ""progressive prosecutor"". Critics noted how she prosecuted a number of cannabis criminal cases during her time as San Francisco district attorney, despite admitting to having tried the drug herself. She also pushed for harsher punishments for parents of truant students, and opposed independent investigations of police shootings until last May. Who will take on Trump in 2020?",Democratic White House hopeful Kamala Harris is dropping out of the presidential race.
"Reports say up to 18 people were shot dead by security forces there. However, officials denied anyone was killed. In the capital, Baghdad, thousands of protesters have defied a curfew to demand jobs, better public services and an end to corruption. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi is under growing pressure to resign. On Tuesday the influential Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr said he would join forces with another powerful politician, Hadi al-Ameri, to bring Mr Abdul Mahdi down through a vote of no confidence. More than 220 people have died across the country since anti-government demonstrations broke out at the beginning of the month. A first wave of protests gave way to a brief lull, but fresh unrest began five days ago. What happened in Karbala? In Karbala - a major centre for Shia Islam - the situation remains unclear, but a number of medical sources and eyewitnesses, backed up by video footage, suggest at least 18 people were killed and hundreds wounded in clashes with the security forces. Rupert Colville, the spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said they were trying to get more information about the situation. ""We have received particularly disturbing reports on what has been going on in Karbala... In both those reports [United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (Unami) and an Iraqi government committee], they recognise that excessive force has been used."" He called on local authorities in the city to ensure security forces acted with restraint and investigate the shootings. The local governor and the police chief in Karbala have denied any protesters were killed, saying that videos circulating widely that show protesters running away from gunfire have been fabricated. What about Baghdad? Thousands of demonstrators vowed to continue their protests in the city, filling up the Iraqi capital's central Tahrir Square on Tuesday. At least 74 people were killed and 3,500 others were injured over the weekend as the protests resumed in Baghdad and elsewhere following a two-week pause that organisers said was designed to give Iraq's leaders time to respond to their demands. Mr Abdul Mahdi has promised to introduce reforms but protesters remain determined to try to sweep away his government. On Monday, security forces fired tear gas to deter any attempting to cross a bridge to the fortified Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies. After the first wave of protests earlier this month, the prime minister promised to carry out a cabinet reshuffle and cut the salaries of high-ranking officials. He also said he would allocate $66m ($51m) to support the unemployed, set up training programmes for youths, and build 100,000 homes in poor areas. Will the government survive? The prime minister has consistently rejected demands by Moqtada Sadr, who leads parliament's largest bloc, to resign and hold snap elections. Mr Ameri, who heads the second largest group in parliament, has previously backed the government. But on Tuesday he announced that he and Mr Sadr would ""work together to achieve the people's demands"". Mr Sadr had earlier issued a public invitation to Mr Ameri to co-ordinate on a no-confidence vote in parliament.","There has been an upsurge of violence in Iraq as anti-government protests enter a fifth day, amid reports of bloodshed in the holy city of Karbala."
"Savita Halappanavar died from infection after miscarrying her first child in an Irish hospital in October 2012. Her family said she pleaded for a termination during the miscarriage, but medical staff refused her requests because there was still a foetal heartbeat. Mrs Halappanavar's death caused international controversy and sparked a campaign to have Ireland's abortion law liberalised. Her parents have now said she will ""rest in peace"" after Irish voters backed a referendum to overturn the country's ban on abortion. The death of the 31-year-old dentist, who was originally from India, became a catalyst for groundbreaking social change in Ireland. Mrs Halappanavar was 17-weeks pregnant with her first child when she was admitted to University Hospital in Galway. Now, almost six years on from her unexpected death, voters have agreed to remove the Republic of Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion and there have been calls to name the new legislation Savita's Law. At her home in Belgaum, southwest India, Savita's mother described the referendum result as a ""victory"" on behalf of her late daughter. ""It was a battle of six years and the battle is won,"" Akkamahadevi Yelagi said. ""Her soul will rest in peace now."" Mrs Yelagi also told BBC News Marathi's Swati Patil-Rajgolkar: ""We are thankful to those who fought the battle for my daughter."" Savita's father, Andanappa Yalgi, told other news outlets he supports calls for the new legislation to be called Savita's Law. On Friday, people in the Republic of Ireland voted to remove the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which gave the unborn an equal right to life as a pregnant woman. It effectively banned abortion in the Republic of Ireland, although terminations could be carried out if a woman's life was at risk. Crowds of pro-choice campaigners chanted the name 'Savita' outside Dublin Castle as the official results of the referendum were announced on Saturday. A new mural dedicated to Mrs Halappanavar, which appeared last week in the city, has become a focal point for the pro-choice movement. Many people left floral tributes and handwritten notes saying that her death had influenced their decision to vote. One of the notes read: ""Sorry we were too late but we are here now, we didn't forget you."" At the time of her death, Savita's widower, Praveen Halappanavar, said hospital staff refused their requests for an abortion during the miscarriage because there was still a foetal heartbeat. He also said staff told them that Ireland was ""a Catholic country"". At the inquest into Savita's death in 2013, midwife Ann Maria Burke apologised for making that remark and said she was trying to explain the position in Ireland on abortion to somebody not from the island. A leading Irish obstetrician told the inquest that Savita would probably have survived if she had got a termination in the first three days of her stay in the hospital. Dr Peter Boylan, the former master of Ireland's National Maternity Hospital, added that under Irish law an abortion would have been illegal because there was ""not a real and substantial risk to her life at that stage"". By the time her life was at risk, it was too late to save her with a termination. The cause of her death was listed as septic shock, E coli in her bloodstream and a miscarriage at 17 weeks. The inquest jury recorded a verdict of ""medical misadventure"" and a health watchdog's investigation identified multiple failings in her medical care.",Her story was one that galvanised a movement; her face became a symbol of that movement.
"The Nobel committee said the group of civil society organisations had made a ""decisive contribution"" to democracy after the 2011 revolution. It said the quartet helped establish a political process when the country ""was on the brink of civil war"". Tunisia's uprising was the first and most successful of the Arab Spring. While other countries - Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Syria - either reverted to authoritarian rule or descended into violence and chaos, Tunisia managed a successful transition to democracy. Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet The surprise winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize has played a key role in mediating between the different parties in the country's post-Arab Spring government. The Quartet is credited with creating a national dialogue between the country's Islamist and secular coalition parties amid deepening political and economic crisis in 2013. Tunisia's revolution - also known as the Jasmine Revolution - began in late 2010 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, followed by the country's first free democratic elections. Kaci Kullman Five, the chair of the Nobel peace committee, said the Quartet's role in Tunisia's democratisation was ""directly comparable to the peace conferences mentioned by Alfred Nobel in his will"". Nobel Peace Prize winners through the years Africa's Nobel Peace Prize winners Houcine Abassi, head of Tunisia's General Labour Union - one of the groups in the quartet - said the award was a ""tribute to martyrs of a democratic Tunisia"". ""This effort by our youth has allowed the country to turn the page on dictatorship,"" he said. Abdessattar Ben Moussa of the Human Rights League - another of the quartet - said the award ""fills us with joy"" at a time when Tunisia ""is going through a period marked by political tensions and terrorist threats"". He told the Associated Press he hoped it would encourage the winners to take a ""larger responsibility"" in solving Tunisia's problems. Tunisia's President Beji Caid Essebsi, said the award recognised the country's decision to choose the ""path of consensus"". ""Tunisia has no other solution than dialogue despite ideological disagreements,"" he said in a video posted to his Facebook page. The quartet is made up of four organisations: the Tunisian General Labour Union, the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts, the Tunisian Human Rights League, and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers. It was created in 2013, two years after the revolution, when security in the country was threatened following the assassination of two key politicians and deadly clashes between Islamists and secular parts of society. Analysis: Rana Jawad, BBC News, Tunisia It has been a tough year for Tunisia. It needed this win, if only to restore some faith in where things went right not long ago. The National Dialogue quartet was created after the high-profile assassination of the leftist politician Mohamed Al-Brahmi in 2013, which sparked protests across the country and came a few months after the first political assassination of Chokri Belaid. It was a time when Tunisia was grappling with striking a balance between the rise of political Islam in the country and the traditional secular politics it had been accustomed to for decades. The quartet brought opposing sides together but was ultimately created to calm the streets. Their critics say its impact lost momentum long ago. Many will be celebrating this win today. But others, taken by surprise, are asking what - in reality - has been achieved given the rise of extremism and the long road ahead for social justice. Tunisians held their first freely contested presidential election last December, which was won by 88-year-old Essebsi of the secular-leaning Nidaa Tounes party. But the country is still facing some very serious security problems, particularly from Islamists over the border in Libya. Tunisia has been rocked by two major terror attacks this year alone - on Tunis's renowned Bardo Museum in March in which 22 people were killed, and on the resort of Sousse in June in which 38 tourists were killed.",The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet for helping the country's transition to democracy.
"Paul MasonFormer economics editor, Newsnight The far right on the march, tube strikes have paralysed the capital. Now there is growing political violence. The police have moved to clear out anarchist squats. Political party offices have been firebombed. Last month, someone fired a Kalashnikov at the HQ of the ruling party, New Democracy. Now the opposition leader Alexis Tsipras has upped the ante, accusing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's government of pursuing a ""strategy of tension"", akin to that allegedly pursued by the Italian secret service in the 1970s. Speaking to a packed audience at an Athens theatre on Monday, he said: ""In 1969, a bomb in Piazza Fontanta in Milan left 17 dead. ""This was the dawn of a long period where far right and fascist groups, in total collaboration with the Italian secret services, the parallel state, and the state within a state, developed what came to be called 'the strategy of tension'. ""Today the manuals of European extreme right have become the gospels of present Greek government."" So far the coalition government - which includes conservatives, social democrats and a small ex-communist party - has managed to stabilise the fiscal crisis, winning key concessions from the IMF and EU. But if - amid political tension - the coalition were to fall, Mr Tsipras would be in with a serious chance of becoming Europe's first far-left prime minister of the post-Cold War era. I met him in his offices in the Greek parliament on Tuesday. I asked him: ""Are you seriously saying the Greek state is pursuing a secret strategy of creating violent tension?"" ""It's not exactly a secret strategy,"" he says. ""I think that it's now obvious that this government is the most right-wing and the most extreme government this country has ever had since the political changeover after 1974. ""It's obvious that the prime minster, Mr Samaras, is trying to establish an agenda which intensifies political conflict and aims at creating a sense of fear within the Greek society, in order to achieve two separate goals: firstly, to get people not to think of the economy, to scare them and have them thinking primarily of their own safety - about the dangers related to the immigrants or demonstrations. ""And secondly, to try and bring together the most conservative parts of our society, in order to establish a stable basis for his own political sway. ""But this strategy, I believe, is a very dangerous one for democracy itself."" The ""strategy of tension"" refers to the dark days of European politics in the Cold War. After the Piazza Fontana bombing, an anarchist being questioned died in custody. Numerous trials - of leftists and far-right activists - in the ensuing decades, failed to establish a perpetrator. The allegation at the time, as far-left and far-right terrorism took off in Italy, was that the violence was being fomented by the ""secret state"", to justify curtailing democracy. So for Mr Tsipras to use this phrase in the Greek context is, to put it mildly, cranking up the political stakes - because there is real political tension in Greece. This month, four anarchists were caught trying to rob a bank. The police Photoshopped their arrest mug-shots because the injuries they received made them barely recognisable. The injuries were allegedly received while in police custody. Meanwhile, police have recently made arrests of people allegedly connected to a terror group called Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire and found arms caches. Amid this, the challenge for Mr Tsipras's party, Syriza, is what would you do if you gained power? About Golden Dawn? About anarchist bank robbers? An already hostile Greek media is asking if Syriza is a party that could ever run the Greek state. ""We will implement the law,"" Mr Tsipras tells me. ""We will rigidly follow the letter of the law. And we shall have zero tolerance towards Golden Dawn, which is a gang, violating the law. ""We shall also uproot all Golden Dawn cells located within the [police and civil service]. We will not tolerate illegal behaviour from anyone or any group. ""And all those groups using violence, claiming that they belong to the anarchist field - a fact I personally do not believe in, because I believe that the use of violence is the most authoritarian act one can exercise - those groups too, will be facing the legal repercussions."" Public support for Syriza, and Mr Tsipras, dipped when the opposition party publicly backed a tube strike that paralysed Athens. Though they scored 27% in the elections, and nearly won, their opponents see Mr Tsipras's complaints about democracy as crying wolf. Thanos Veremis, Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, told me: ""The paradox here is that Mr Tsipras is crying wolf. ""His party is going down in the polls and that has caused some panic among the party cadres. ""It's a fact that recently the government is taking advantage of throwing Tsipras's own statements back at him, in order to convince the undecided voters. Mostly because the undecided voters are not radicals - the radicals are where they want to be, whether of the left or right."" I ask Mr Tsipras whether the Syriza should now admit that the coalition has stabilised the fiscal situation, and that Syriza's proposed policy - of a selective moratorium or default - would have just crashed the Greek economy? ""No serious person could admit something like this. Look at the data,"" he replies. ""In Greece, in the last three years, in order to reduce the Primary Deficit of the government by 25bn euros ($33bn, Â£21bn), we reduced the internal demand by 70bn euros - that is the Greek economy shrunk by 70bn euros. ""It's like having seen a snake in a tree and deciding to burn the entire forest, to get rid of the snake."" Mr Tsipras has been on the offensive since the IMF admitted it had miscalculated - ie underestimated - the negative impact of spending cuts and tax rises on the Eurozone economy. He is scathing about this controversy about the so-called ""multiplier effect"": ""They admit that they failed to calculate correctly the multiplier. But, please, allow me to say that if this kind of mistake was to be revealed in any company, and if the people who made the mistake came forth and admitted it, the company would have at least reimbursed the client and would have fired the employees who made the mistake. ""Here we have the following sadistic absurdity: the IMF admitting that they have made a mistake, but continuing with the plan, without even an apology."" ""And what's even more absurd, it's that the client does not protest! The Greek government is saying 'no problem, you made a mistake and we continue with this mistake'."" Mr Tsipras has been feted in Rio, Buenos Aires, and even the think-tank circuit in Washington recently. But his own supporters are restive. There is a growing minority within Syriza which supports leaving the euro. And the rank and file see the growth of the far right and fear that, while the far right are expressing raw anger, Mr Tsipras and the party's new MPs, look more and more like mainstream politicians - who on the Greek streets are despised. I ask him: ""Who are you? Are you the man of the parliamentary opposition or are you the man who is going to lead the strikers out here into a mass uprising against this government?"" ""I think that this is exactly our biggest advantage. We can be at the same time the parliamentary opposition and tomorrow the government. At the same time we can be down in the streets, fighting and mobilising the masses. ""This is probably what they cannot accept, the political, the economic and the media authorities in Greece. Because in Greece we are governed by an oligarchy. It's the oligarchy of the media and of the plutocrats. ""So, we do have this advantage. We can participate in a protest, motivating people to defend their rights, while at the same time, we can be in Washington discussing with the IMF, the State Department or in Germany, conversing with Schauble, in order to voice the fair demands of the Greek people. ""We have one and a half million people unemployed, one and a half million people with a monthly wage lower than 600 euros. ""And the main question for me and for all of us involved in politics is how will all those people survive? How will these people live? ""And in order for those people to live, they need to defeat the fear and claim their rights. That's why I am here. I'm here to help those people claim what's theirs."" Not forgotten On the night Syriza lost the election I was in the party's cramped HQ. One of the party's activists told me: ""We lost, that's great for us."" The assumption was that, as the economic crisis deepened, it would be Syriza next in power. But the governing parties, through their PR teams, are relentlessly forcing the issue with Mr Tsipras: parliament or the streets? Syriza activists privately admit the party is reeling under the pressure. But Mr Tsipras knows that - even if the country's finances are stabilized - with relentless austerity the governing parties are acutely vulnerable to issues raised by the past. ""If our government and Mr Samaras believe that he can run this country for ever, using blackmail, terrorism and the tension strategy he is sadly mistaken. Because the Greek people have a long tradition of democracy and struggle."" By raising the half-forgotten events of Italy in the early 1970s, Mr Tsipras is reminding Greeks of never-forgotten events: the anti-Nazi Resistance during World War II, the Civil War, the military junta in the 1960s and its overthrow in 1974. It is another throw of the dice in Greece, a country whose crisis is nowhere near over.",Greece is a country where economic crisis has given way to social crisis.
"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent The most serious face-off on the world's longest unsettled land border in nearly half a century left 20 Indian soldiers dead. India says both sides suffered casualties. ""Once fatalities are sustained, keeping everything quiet becomes hard on both sides. Now public pressure becomes a variable,"" Dr Narang, a security studies professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told me. ""The scale, scope and swathe of the pressure across the border is seemingly unprecedented."" The two nuclear armed neighbours have a chequered history of face-offs and overlapping territorial claims along the more than 3,440km (2,100 mile), poorly drawn Line of Actual Control (LAC) separating the two sides. Border patrols have often bumped into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles. But no bullets have been fired in four decades. That is why the latest clash, following months of roiling tension, has taken many by surprise. ""It is an extraordinary escalation,"" Shashank Joshi, Defence Editor at The Economist magazine, told me. ""No shots fired for 45 years, and then at least 20 soldiers dead in one evening in rock-throwing and bludgeoning."" The clash comes amid fresh tensions between the two powers, which have brawled along the border in recent weeks but not exchanged any gunfire. Reports say in early May, Chinese forces put up tents, dug trenches and moved heavy equipment several kilometres inside what had been regarded by India as its territory in Galwan valley in Ladakh. Ajai Shukla, a leading Indian defence analyst, has claimed that China had captured 60 sq km of Indian-patrolled territory in the area in the past one month. India claims China already occupies 38,000sq km (about 14,700sq miles) of its territory. The move came after India built a road several hundred kilometres long connecting to a high-altitude forward air base which it reactivated in 2008. 'One of the most serious crises in years' The details of how Monday's skirmish unfolded remain fuzzy. India and China are accusing each other of violating the consensus to respect the Line of Actual Control that separates the both sides in the Galwan Valley. India says the two sides have been exploring military and diplomatic channels to de-escalate the situation and that senior commanders had a ""productive meeting"" on 6 June. They agreed ""on a process of de-escalation"" and subsequently, the ground commanders had a series of meetings to implement the consensus, India's foreign ministry said. India said both sides suffered casualties after the Chinese ""unilaterally tried to change the status quo."" And China accuses India troops of ""violating"" the consensus, crossing the border twice and carrying out provocative attacks on Chinese personnel"". Ankit Panda, a senior editor at The Diplomat magazine, says the ongoing crisis was ""already among the most serious between the two countries - certainly since the 2017 Doklam standoff and possibly much longer"". Road construction by the Chinese triggered a 73-day standoff in 2017 at a junction of India, China and Bhutan. But Chinese behaviour this time has ""been very different from what we have seen in the past,"" Shivshankar Menon, a China expert and a former national security advisor, says. ""What we have seen is multiple incidents, multiple moves forward and China occupying spaces which it never occupied before along the LAC. This is a worrying sign because it's different from Chinese behaviour in the past,"" Mr Menon told interviewer Karan Thapar in The Wire, an independent online news portal. Theories abound on the reasons behind China's actions in the area. In a tactical sense, Delhi's beefing up of the border infrastructure may have triggered the Chinese army into action in Ladakh. The pandemic may have provided the cover for China to act, particularly as the Indian army had delayed exercises in Ladakh in March. ""But I doubt it was the only cause,"" says Mr Joshi. ""Is it about the road? Is it about Article 370 [India's action of unilaterally changing the status quo of Kashmir in August last year] Is it broader aggressiveness? We don't know,"" says Dr Narang. ""But it is tense and it is not over."" Mr Menon, who served as India's ambassador to China, believes that China is resorting to strident nationalism, due to ""domestic and economic stresses"" at home. ""You can see it in their behaviour in Yellow Sea, towards Taiwan, passing laws without consulting Hong Kong, more assertive on India's border, a tariff war with Australia."" On Tuesday evening, India said the troops had disengaged from the clash site. Early reports suggest that established military channels were being used and both sides were not escalating. ""That's good news for India, which has few credible retaliatory options in the current environment,"" says Mr Panda. Mr Joshi believes the most important consequences of Monday's clashes will be the ""wider and long-term diplomatic one"". ""For 10 years, Sino-Indian rivalry has steadily intensified, but remained largely stable,"" he said. India and China have also been more engaged. Bilateral trade increased 67 times between 1998 and 2012, and China is India's largest trading partner in goods. Indian students have flocked to Chinese universities. Both sides have held joint military exercises. ""Now we may be entering a new period of heightened mistrust and antagonism washing away much of the bonhomie on display at the Wuhan summit in 2018,"" says Mr Joshi.","""It is looking bad, very bad,"" says security analyst Vipin Narang, of the deadly clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh on Monday night."
"When Payal met Kanchan, back in 2017, she had no idea she would fall in love with her fellow trainee. In 2018, Indiaâs Supreme Court ruled that gay sex was no longer a criminal offence, overturning a previous judgement that upheld a colonial-era law. But age-old customs and regressive attitudes survived, making it difficult for same-sex relationships to be accepted by larger society. The women, both now 24, have been living together as a couple since 2018 in the western Indian state of Gujarat, and they know first hand what the discrimination feels like. Their love story was thrust into the limelight last month when they approached the high court. âOur families are against our relationship. They are threatening us,â Payal said, adding that the two filed an application before the court, asking for police protection. The court ruled that the couple should be protected by armed guards. So-called honour killings - when someone is murdered by a family member due to the belief that they have brought shame upon the community - are not uncommon in India and other South Asian countries. One study found that hundreds of people are killed each year in India for falling in love or marrying against their families' wishes. Payal and Kanchan grew up in two remote villages in Gujarat, where a conservative and patriarchal culture reigned supreme. Both said they wanted to break barriers and felt inspired to enter a field dominated by men. They settled on policing. In 2017, when they first met, they said others in the force were reluctant to speak to them since they came from rural parts of the state whereas the rest were from bigger towns and cities. Instantly, they felt alienated from their peers. The two women were assigned the same room during police training. They fell into a comfortable routine - in the evenings, exhausted from exercise, they would meet to catch up and discuss their day. Soon, their chats stretched to include their lives and families, and the two became best friends. âIf Kanchan washed my clothes, I cooked food for her. With time, our friendship grew stronger and we exchanged phone numbers to keep in touch after training finished,â Payal said. Coincidentally, the two were then posted to the same city and they decided to live in police accommodation, sharing a room. âIf Payal had night duty, I handled all the work at home and if I had to work at night, Payal managed all the housework,"" Kanchan said. âWe were happy with our work and as time passed, our lives started to revolve around each other.â It was around this point in their friendship that the two fell in love. âOn 31 December 2017, we hugged each other on New Yearâs Eve just before the clock struck midnight. It was maybe the first time we had hugged each other - and we felt completely different,â Kanchan said. Soon, the families of the two women began asking them to get married - Kanchanâs family had already lined up suitable matches for her - but they managed to stave off the pressure. It was at the end of last year when their colleagues living in the police quarters found out about their relationship that the couple decided to tell their own families. âThey were in shock,â Payal said. The women claim that their families started following them and keeping a constant check on their movements. And then, earlier this year, things got really ugly. âOne day, my family followed us when we were on duty. They stopped our vehicle in the middle of the road and threatened us,â Payal alleged. âThey also came by the police quarters once and created a scene there, calling us names and using abusive language. âA few days after this incident, I received an anonymous death threat. Thatâs when we decided to approach the court for protection,â she said. The couple are happy that the court has ruled in their favour and granted them protection - itâs given them some time to think of the future. âOnce the coronavirus pandemic ends, we want to go to southern India on a sort of honeymoon,â Kanchan said. The couple also want to adopt a child in the future. While homosexuality is no longer illegal, there is no law in India that facilitates same-sex couples to get married - or spells out their rights, including that of adoption. But the women are hopeful. âWeâre only 24 now but we want to start saving money and adopt a child, raising them well with access to good education,â Payal said.

"Ahmed Ouyahia was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Abdelmalek Sellal to 12 years. They were accused of abusing authority in a car manufacturing embezzlement scandal. It was the first time since Algeria's independence from France in 1962 that ex-prime ministers were put on trial. The two were allies of long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who resigned amid mass protests in April. Protesters have continued to call for sweeping reforms, accusing leaders of the governing party of widespread corruption and repression ahead of presidential elections. Ouyahia and Sellal were among 19 defendants tried on charges of money laundering, abuse of office, and granting undue privileges in the vehicle assembly industry. One serving cabinet minister, Abdesalem Bouchoureb was sentenced to 20 years in prison in absentia. An international arrest warrant has been issued for him amid reports that he is abroad. Defence lawyers boycotted the trial, alleging the proceedings were ""politicised"" and aimed at ""settling scores"", AFP news agency reports. The convicted men, however, have 10 days to appeal against the sentence, BBC North Africa analyst Ahmed Rouaba says. The scandal hit automotive sector was launched in 2014 through partnerships between foreign groups and large Algerian corporations, often owned by businessmen linked to people close to Mr Bouteflika, news agency AFP reports. The verdict comes two days before a presidential election, the first since Mr Boueflika was forced out of office. Pro-democracy activists see the poll as a ploy by Mr Bouteflika's allies to hold on to power, and have been waging mass protests to demand its cancellation.",An Algerian court has sentenced two former prime ministers to long jail terms amid a huge corruption investigation.
"By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi And at the centre of its troubles is Kangana Ranaut - a 33-year-old female star who appears to be on a warpath with many of her colleagues. In the past few weeks, she has accused industry bigwigs of nepotism and sexual abuse, harshly criticised several of her colleagues, alleged others are involved in drug dealing, and called Bollywood a ""gutter"". Ranaut says she was ""harassed and molested in the industry and faced a drug racket"" and that by ""removing the obstacles"" in her way, she would ""clean the path for many others"". But her critics say her vocal criticisms stem from political ambition. There are rumours she is on the verge of joining India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and accusations that the colleagues she has picked on are those whose political beliefs differ from hers. Known for her powerful performances, Ranaut has won several prestigious awards and a Padma Shri (a civilian award given by the government) for her contribution to cinema. A small-town girl, who has often spoken of her struggles to fit in with the glamorous crowd, Ranaut rose to become a style icon and one of Bollywood's most bankable actresses, with millions of fans at home and abroad. ""She's an outstanding performer,"" said Shailaja Bajpai, media editor of news website The Print. ""She's a natural actress who's played strong, unusual women in a number of films and carved a special niche for herself."" Over the years, Ranaut also gained a reputation for being ""outspoken and brave"", Bajpai said. ""She's taken on powerful people in the industry like director Karan Johar, whom she accused of nepotism; she also had a very public spat with Hrithik Roshan, her co-star from Kites whom she calls 'a silly ex'."" Roshan has always denied that the two ever had an affair. Ranaut has also criticised the industry over its alleged ""casting couch"" culture - a euphemism used to explain the practice of seeking sexual favours from newcomers in exchange for roles. Her forthrightness has won her praise for standing up to clannish, patriarchal Bollywood bigwigs. But for some months now she has made news by picking new fights on a weekly, if not daily, basis. It began in mid-June, when Ranaut joined the debate around the tragic death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput - who was found dead in his home. Mumbai police said Rajput had killed himself. Ranaut tweeted blaming nepotism and some Bollywood insiders for driving the actor to his death. She said he was an ""outsider"" like her who had no ""godfathers"" in the industry, and that powerful Bollywood families and directors had ""systematically sabotaged"" his career. Weeks later, when Rajput's father accused his son's actress-girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty of abetment to suicide, stealing his son's money and several other claims, Ranaut launched a smear campaign against Chakraborty, calling her ""a small time druggie who was living off a vulnerable and broken, self-made superstar"". Chakraborty has denied all the accusations against her. She was arrested earlier this month for allegedly buying drugs for Rajput and she is being investigated by three federal agencies. Chakraborty has found herself targeted by some of India's most high-profile journalists and social media trolls and become subject of gossip and innuendo and misogynistic abuse, with Ranaut's regular outbursts on the subject adding fuel to the fire. Ranaut has also taken aim at Bollywood more widely, reviving old battles and starting several new ones. She has played the victim and the aggressor at the same time. In television interviews and tweets, she's repeated old grudges against director Karan Johar and former co-star Hrithik Roshan. She has called actress Sonam Kapoor a ""mafia bimbo"", Urmila Matondkar ""a soft-porn star"" and Swara Bhaskar and Richa Chadha ""B-grade actresses"". She's claimed there was a ""drug mafia"" in Bollywood and renamed the industry ""Bullywood"" - a place where newcomers and outsiders are not welcome. Her bitter and angry finger-pointing has led many to question her motives. ""Kangana Ranaut is a fine actor who was once known for her craft and her courage, but has now allowed that courage to degenerate into self-promotion and sexist attacks on women she disagrees with and the single-minded pursuit of a right-wing agenda,"" said journalist and film critic Anna MM Vetticad in an interview. When Kangana first raised the issue of nepotism and challenged powerful people in Bollywood in 2017, it was ""remarkable"", said Vetticad, since the actress stood to lose a lot by doing so. ""But today that crucial discussion has been drowned out by the lack of logic, honesty and consistency in her statements,"" Vetticad said. ""While claiming to bat for outsiders entering Bollywood, Ranaut makes demeaning, even outright misogynistic comments about outsiders who oppose her ideologically, and it has become painfully clear that her commitment is not to the cause but to her image as its number one ambassador."" Ranaut's verbal attacks against Bollywood have been echoed in India's parliament too, forcing MP and veteran actress Jaya Bachchan to defend the industry ""which provides direct employment to half a million people daily and indirect employment to five million"". The entertainment industry has a significant influence over people's imagination in India. The press in India, especially television channels sympathetic to the government, has played the story of the unravelling of Bollywood on a loop. So on Saturday, when Deepika Padukone, one of India's most loved stars, was summoned by the drug authorities investigating allegations of widespread drug use in Bollywood, TV channels provided breathless coverage and reporters chased her car. Similar scenes were witnessed when actresses Shraddha Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan and Rakul Preet Singh were called for questioning. All four have denied any wrongdoing. Ranaut responded by deriding the actresses in Twitter posts, including one comment targeting Padukone in which she claimed drug used was linked to depression - a claim criticised and debunked by health experts. Ranaut has also been engaged in a bitter fight with the Shiv Sena party in Maharashtra, the state where Mumbai - the home of Bollywood - is located. The Sena, which governs the state, is a former ally - and now bitter rival - of the BJP. ""She's playing the political game, fighting the BJP's battle with Shiv Sena,"" said Bajpai. The Sena responded by threatening her, claiming a part of her home-office was built illegally, and then demolishing it - an act for which they were severely reprimanded by the Bombay High Court. Critics say the Ranaut story is just a diversion. It comes at a time when India is battling much more pressing issues: a Covid-19 caseload that is the second-highest in the world, an economy that is down in the dumps, and rising tensions on the border with China. But some say the selective targeting of celebrities appears to be part of a bigger conspiracy to destroy Bollywood as we know it. Over the past few years, the entertainment industry has been polarised between those who support the government's right-wing ideology and liberals who oppose it. ""Through the drug probe, the government is trying to assume control of Bollywood through intimidation and threats,"" wrote the author and columnist Shobhaa De in the Times of India. ""The long-term benefits of insidiously taking over the lives and content of India's vibrant entertainment industry are obvious,"" De wrote. Ranaut's motivations may yet become clear, but for now opinion is divided over why she would attempt to upend an industry she is a part of. ""She's spoken about how she was treated badly in the beginning, she's been nursing that slight. And to be fair, she's still standing up to the powerful, she's still criticising nepotism in Bollywood,"" Bajpai said. ""Now what's her motive? Is she settling scores? Is she seeking a political role? Who knows. But the way she's doing it is questionable. I think she has gone too far.""","Bollywood, India's hugely popular Hindi film industry, is in ferment."
"It came after a right-wing group threatened to attack cinemas screening his latest movie starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. Anti-Pakistan sentiment has grown after a militant attack killed 18 soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. Social media is divided over Johar's statement and what it says about India. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), a regional right-wing party, has vowed that it will not allow the movie to be screened. 'Intolerant India': Is criticism against Modi's BJP justified? The cadres of the party have traditionally resorted to violence to fulfil their demands, and have threatened other actors in the past, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. A number of small cinema hall owners fear violence and have said that they will not screen Johar's new film, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (Difficulties of the heart). Johar appealed to the MNS to allow the film to be released, and said, ""for me my country comes first. Nothing else matters but my country. I always felt that the best way to express your patriotism is through love and that's all I always tried to do through my work, and my cinema."" He added that ""over 300 Indian people in my crew have put their blood, sweat and tears in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and I don't think it is fair to them to face any kind of turbulence on account of other fellow Indians"". The video statement has caused a lot of chatter on social media and in the Indian media, with many condemning the pressure put on Johar and pointing out that it signalled a worrying trend in India to wear your nationalism on your sleeve. However many other social media users criticised Johar and his decision to use Khan in the movie. There has been a lot of pressure on Bollywood to stop working with Pakistani actors in order to ""prove their patriotism"" after India blamed Pakistan of masterminding the deadly Kashmir attack, a charge Pakistan has denied. Later, the Indian government said it had carried out ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control, the de facto border between Indian- and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Johar had initially responded by saying that banning Pakistani actors ""would not stop terrorism"". Other stars including Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra as well as director Anurag Kashyap have all spoken out against the movement to drop Pakistani actors.",A statement by popular Bollywood director Karan Johar promising not to work with Pakistani actors in the future has gone viral in India.
"The upper house and President Vladimir Putin are now expected to turn the bill into law. Approval in the largely pro-Putin Duma (lower house) was overwhelming. Human rights activists have condemned the bill, seeing it as a tool to crush dissent. The Duma also voted to impose big fines for libel or slander. Journalists from some leading Russian news outlets demonstrated outside the Duma against the new libel law, which envisages fines of up to 5m rubles (Â£99,000; $153,000) for offenders. They warned that it would bring extra pressure on the media. The NGO bill requires all the relevant NGOs' materials to include the phrase ""foreign agents"". The term carries a Soviet-era negative taint in Russia, suggesting spying, correspondents say. The Kremlin says the bill is needed to protect Russia from outside attempts to influence internal politics. Some NGOs complain that they have to seek funding from abroad because they cannot get it from the Russian state. There are also fears that the bill could be used to restrict independent election monitoring. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said state funding would be increased for NGOs whose activity ""as a whole is deemed useful and positive for our country"". Under the bill, foreign-funded NGOs involved in politics will also have to undergo financial audits and issue twice-yearly reports on their activities. Failure to comply will be punishable by heavy fines or even a two-year prison sentence.","Russia's lower house of parliament has adopted a controversial bill that labels foreign-funded non-governmental organisations as ""foreign agents""."
"The BJP said the three-year alliance with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) had become ""untenable"" in the wake of increasing violence. The PDP's decision to ally with the BJP had been seen as controversial. Its time in power was marked by rising violence in the Kashmir valley. Influential Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari was killed by unidentified gunmen as he was leaving his office in Srinagar last week. Mr Bukhari's death was cited as one of the reasons for the BJP pulling out of the alliance. The decision also came days after the UN's human rights office called for an independent inquiry into human rights violations in both parts of Kashmir, run respectively by India and Pakistan. What led to the split? The BJP and PDP alliance was an uneasy one even at the best of times, with the two being very unlikely coalition partners on paper. Since its formation in 1951, the BJP has maintained a hardline stance on the Kashmir issue and has stood for the repeal of Article 370 of India's constitution which grants special autonomous status to the state. In sharp contrast to the BJP, the PDP has been seen as a pro-Kashmir party. Critics accuse it of peddling ""soft separatism"" revolving around reconciliation with Pakistan and separatist groups fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir. When the alliance was forged between then PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and the BJP, many of the party's supporters saw it as a betrayal of its people and backers. Has the conflict worsened? This uneasiness marked the entire three years the coalition was in power. It saw increased violence and protests against Indian rule, with civilians often clashing with security forces. The two parties disagreed over how to handle the situation. While the PDP called for more restraint, the BJP advocated a more hardline approach. During this time Indian forces were also accused of using ""disproportionate violence"" against civilian protesters. The use of pellet guns to disperse protests was condemned around the world as thousands of civilians suffered injuries. Many lost their sight completely. The BJP gave two main reasons for quitting the alliance: the deteriorating law and order situation in Indian-administered Kashmir, and the lack of development in other parts of the state. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti told reporters that her party believes in reconciliation while the BJP insisted on following ""muscular policies"" which cannot bring peace to Kashmir. ""We worked for months to form an understanding with the BJP. We wanted the BJP to start the process of reconciliation in Kashmir and ease tensions with Pakistan,"" she added. What's next? The state will be put under governor's rule unless another coalition forms the government or fresh elections are called. Forming a government will require the support of 44 of the 89 legislators in the state assembly. The elections in 2015 gave the PDP 28 legislators while the BJP won 25. If the PDP were to ally with the Congress party which has 12 lawmakers, they would also need the support of the state's three elected independent lawmakers to get the required numbers. In another scenario, the Congress, the PDP and the main opposition National Conference (NC) could come together to form a government. But the chances of these parties coming together are slim because the PDP and NC have always been at loggerheads in the state. The leader of the NC, former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, is reportedly on his way to meet the governor. He tweeted ""so it has come to pass"" after the news of the BJP pullout but has not commented since.","The chief minister of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti, has resigned after the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) quit a coalition with her party."
"The riot erupted on Sunday morning in Saint-Aignan after a gendarme had shot and killed a traveller who had driven through a checkpoint, officials said. Travellers armed with hatchets and iron bars then attacked the village police station and hacked down trees. They also toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars. ""It was a settling of scores between the travellers and the gendarmerie,"" said the village mayor, Jean-Michel Billon. He said the travellers also pillaged a bakery in the village. Just 3,400 people live in the village in a popular tourist region of central France. Dangerous driver Prosecutors quoted by the French TV channel TF1 said a traveller called Luigi had failed to stop at a police checkpoint on Friday night and had dragged a gendarme on the car bonnet for 500 metres (yards). The gendarme escaped with only minor injuries. As the driver approached a second checkpoint he accelerated towards two gendarmes, one of whom opened fire. The car continued on to Saint-Romain-sur-Cher, where the driver's body was later recovered, the prosecutors said. Luigi had picked up another traveller after the first checkpoint, the TF1 report said. It is not yet clear why Luigi had tried to flee the gendarmes. In separate rioting at the weekend, youths clashed with police in the Alpine city of Grenoble. Four men were arrested in a dawn raid on Sunday after they allegedly fired at police during a riot early on Saturday in the suburb of Villeneuve. The rioting was triggered by the death of 27-year-old Karim Boudouda, who was shot by police on Thursday during a chase.",Three hundred soldiers are patrolling a normally tranquil village in France's Loire Valley after dozens of armed travellers clashed with police.
"Mr Putin, the current prime minister, won nearly 64% of the vote. Election observers have urged any fraud allegations be fully investigated. At least 120 people were detained at rallies in Russia, including opposition leaders Alexei Navalny and Sergei Udaltsov in Moscow. Pro-Putin rallies have also been held. In Moscow, police said at least 14,000 people had attended the approved protest rally on Pushkin Square, a short walk from the Kremlin. Previous protests in the city attracted up to 100,000 people. Mr Navalny, the blogger at the heart of the election protest movement, told the rally to applause: ""They will never stop. Who will stop these people? We will!"" Arguing that the protest movement in Russia's big cities had overestimated its strength and had failed to convey to the whole country the message that ""thieves and swindlers"" were in power, he promised a new effort. A number of people refused to leave the square after the rally and riot police began arresting them. Some 50 people were arrested at a separate protest on Moscow's Lubyanka Square, where the headquarters of the Federal Security Service is located. A rally in support of Mr Putin was held on Manege Square, beside the Kremlin, with reports of about 14,000 people attending there as well. Andrei Isayev, a senior official in the ruling United Russia party, began the rally with the slogan ""Russia, Putin, victory"", chanted back by the crowd. ""We have proved our right to freedom and independence,"" he said. ""Long live the multi-ethnic people of Russia, a conqueror people."" In St Petersburg, protesters hurled flares and let off signal rockets, Russian media report. About 70 arrests were made at an unapproved rally which numbered about 800 people, police say. Hundreds of protesters also marched in Yekaterinburg, the main city in the Urals, chanting ""Putin thief!"". 'Carousel voting' Amid claims of widespread fraud, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) urged Russia to carry out a thorough investigation. In a statement on the OSCE website,monitors said that while all candidates had been able to campaign freely, there had been ""serious problems"" from the start. ""The point of elections is that the outcome should be uncertain,"" said Tonino Picula, co-ordinator of the OSCE mission. ""This was not the case in Russia. There was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt."" The election was held against a backdrop of discontent, sparked by allegations of widespread fraud during the December election in favour of United Russia. On Sunday, irregularities were seen particularly during the vote count ""which was assessed negatively in almost one-third of polling stations observed"", the OSCE said. Earlier Golos, a leading Russian independent election watchdog, said it had received more than 3,000 reports of voting fraud. The watchdog said its own exit polls suggested Mr Putin had actually won just over 50% of the vote - a result that would still have elected him in the first round. State TV exit polls had given him about 59% of the vote. Other allegations, including videos purporting to show evidence of voting irregularities, have been circulating online. There were reports of ""carousel voting"", with voters being bussed between polling stations to cast multiple ballots, and of people being paid to vote for Mr Putin. In other developments 'Glory to Russia!' Alexei Pushkov, an adviser to Mr Putin, told the BBC that while there might have been violations, they had happened on all sides, and would not have distorted the final result. Speaking to tens of thousands of supporters in Moscow on Sunday night, an emotional Mr Putin said he had won in an open and honest battle. ""I promised you we would win, and we won - glory to Russia!"" he said. Mr Putin moved into the post of prime minister in 2008 because of a constitutional ban on a third consecutive term as president. He will return to the presidency in May - replacing his close ally Dmitry Medvedev - and remain in post until 2018, when he could then run for another six-year term.","Russia's presidential election was ""clearly skewed"" in favour of the winner, Vladimir Putin, international monitors have said."
"Islanders had been asked to consider government-proposed changes to driving-related charges in a consultation. There are currently 80 different payment categories for taxing a vehicle on the island, which the Manx government said was ""too complicated"". A Tynwald spokesman said there was a ""firm desire"" for change, but 89% of respondents opposed congestion charges. Tax income from about 70,000 Manx-based vehicles is used to help maintain about 680 miles (1,100km) of road on the island. The consultation questioned how road maintenance should be funded into the future, as the Department of Infrastructure said increasing costs and a reduced workforce meant it had become ""increasingly difficult to meet public and political expectations"". Results of the consultation, which had 600 respondents, also showed that 84% were against taxing vehicles based on their age and opinion was split almost equally over classic cars continuing to pay a reduced rate. The government said no decisions had been made about future charges, but the consultation responses would ""help shape the development of policy"".","Manx drivers have backed proposals to simply the island's vehicle tax system, but rejected congestion charge plans."
"Bush had to use a pseudonym and the boy, seven when the sponsorship started, had no idea who he was. Bush, under the name George Walker, helped to fund education and meals. The boy, Timothy, learned his mentor's identity when he left the scheme at 17 and was stunned, the charity, Compassion International, said. The charity revealed some of the letters to the Colorado Springs Gazette and later in an interview with CNN. Bush, the 41st US president, died in November at the age of 94. ""Dear Timothy, I want to be your new pen pal,"" Bush said in his first letter in 2002, using the pseudonym, a combination of his first and third names. ""I am an old man, 77 years old, but I love kids; and though we have not met I love you already,"" he wrote. ""I live in Texas - I will write you from time to time - Good Luck."" 'Have you heard of the White House?' Compassion International is a Christian, humanitarian charity that helps children living in poverty. The former president first learned about its child sponsorship scheme in 2001 during a Christmas concert in Washington. It is thought his identity was kept secret because of concerns Timothy could be targeted if people learned he was corresponding with a former US president. But this did not stop Bush from dropping hints in his letters, according to the charity's former president, Wess Stafford, who screened all the letters. ""He was known for being a trickster,"" Mr Stafford told the BBC. ""Timothy, have you ever heard of the White House?"" Bush asked in one of his letters. ""That's where the president of the USA lives. I got to go to the White House at Christmas time. Here is a little booklet that I got at the White House in Washington."" Even Bush's family had no idea about the letters until years later, Mr Stafford said. He met Bush's son George - also a former US president - at a state dinner in 2008 and told them about the sponsorship. ""Laura teared up,"" Mr Stafford said of George W Bush's wife, Laura Bush. ""George [W Bush] paused for a moment and said 'Yep, that sounds like my Daddy.'"" Along with letters, ""Bush 41"" also sent presents, including art supplies. Bush received messages back from Timothy to thank him for his presents. ""Thank you for not forgetting me. You're so nice and good,"" read one letter. When Timothy learned who his mentor was he said it was life-changing, although the charity has not been able to get in touch with him since. ""I love that one of the most powerful men in the world, without any fanfare, reached out to one of the poorest children in the world,"" said Mr Stafford. ""I have a feeling that he did a lot of good things that we don't know about and a lot of things we probably never will.""",A charity has revealed the secret exchanges former US President George HW Bush had with a Filipino boy he sponsored over a 10-year period.
"A royal decree said ministers' salaries would be reduced by 20%, and housing and car allowances for members of the advisory Shura Council cut by 15%. Lower-ranking civil servants will see wage increases suspended, and overtime payments and annual leave capped. About two-thirds of working Saudis are employed in the public sector. Their salaries and allowances accounted for 45% of government spending in 2015, or $128bn (Â£99bn), and contributed to a record budget deficit of $98bn. 'Sign of the times' BBC Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher says the unspoken contract that once existed between ordinary Saudis and the ruling elite - in which citizens could all but expect a none-too-stressful job for life in return for accepting the status quo - has long been eroding. But, our correspondent adds, the deficit highlighted the urgent need for change. In April, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman unveiled a reform plan intended to reduce the government's spending and lessen its dependence on oil revenue. The ""Vision 2030"" initiative aims to cut the public sector payroll to 40% of the budget by the start of the next decade and boost private sector employment. The government also cut the generous subsidies for petrol and utilities in December, but complaints prompted Prince Mohammed to sack the water and electricity minister six months later. Some Saudis took to social media to express their support the cuts announced on Monday, using the Twitter hashtag ""We are the children of King Salman"". But others lamented what they remembered as better days under the late King Abdullah, who responded to the Arab Spring in 2011 by launching a $130bn plan to raise public sector salaries, build subsidised housing and provide benefits to the unemployed. The hashtag ""stop allowances for princes"" also trended among Saudi Twitter users. ""If there is hardship, we should all share the cost,"" wrote @oamaz7. Jamal Khashoggi, editor of Al-Arab News, told Reuters news agency: ""It's one more economic measure to balance spending. Of course people don't like it, but it's a sign of the times."" ""Probably the teachers and many others will be affected by it. It shows why it's important for the private sector and Saudi GDP to diversify,"" he added.","Saudi Arabia has unveiled pay cuts for government employees for the first time, as it attempts to further rein in spending at a time of low oil prices."
"""I'm very sorry that the feelings of our Muslim brethren have been hurt,"" Pope Shenouda III said on state TV. Earlier, Bishop Bishoy had said that - contrary to Muslim belief - some verses of the Koran may have been inserted after the death of Prophet Muhammad. Egypt's al-Azhar Islamic authority said the comments threatened national unity. ""This kind of behaviour is irresponsible and threatens national unity at a time when it is vital to protect it,"" said Grand Imam Ahmed al-Tayyeb in a statement issued on Saturday by al-Azhar, one of the key centres of religious learning in Sunni Islam. He was reacting to comments carried in the Egyptian media in which Bishop Bishoy, the Coptic Church's second highest clergyman, called into question the Koranic verses disputing the divine nature of Jesus Christ. The bishop reportedly said the verses were inserted after Prophet Muhammad's death by one of his successors. 'Deep red line' Muslims believe that all the verses of the Koran were revealed to the prophet through the Archangel Gabriel and they are the immutable word of God. ""Debating religious beliefs are a red line, a deep red line,"" Pope Shenouda said in the television interview on Sunday. ""The simple fact of bringing up the subject was inappropriate, and escalating the matter is inappropriate,"" he added. Although Egypt's Muslims and Copts generally live in peace, tensions are on the rise over the construction of new churches and reported cases of conversions. Copts make up six to 10% of the country's 80 million people and complain of systematic discrimination by the state.","The leader of Egypt's Coptic Christians has apologised for ""inappropriate"" comments by a bishop that cast doubt on the authenticity of some Koran verses."
"The results of the hotly-contested poll are due in the next few hours. Early projections have put Joko Widodo in the lead. But Mr Subianto told reporters there was massive systemic fraud and vowed to challenge the results in court. He added that his camp would not resort to violence. Most ""quick counts"" after the 9 July election had placed Mr Widodo, the popular Jakarta governor, in the lead. But his rival Mr Subianto, a former military general under Suharto, said earlier that other polls showed he had won. The Election Commission has since been tallying votes. Outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has urged both parties to respect the result. Security is tight for the announcement, with more than 250,000 police officers on duty across the nation. There are fears the result could trigger violence between rival groups of supporters. Both candidates have raised concerns about voting irregularities during the past two weeks, as ballots from nearly 500,000 polling stations have been tallied. Reliable polls point to a win for Mr Widodo, also known as Jokowi, by about five percentage points. Official results from the sub-district and provincial levels that have been released so far also indicate Mr Widodo has won by between three and five percentage points. But Mr Subianto's camp have said they will not accept official results until allegations of cheating are probed. Mr Subianto told reporters on Sunday that if the Election Commission did not investigate possible voting fraud, that was a ""crime"" that ""very much calls into question the legitimacy of the whole process"". He called on the Election Commission to delay announcing the result - a request the commission rejected. How media responded to poll rejection, BBC Monitoring Just before 0800 GMT the breaking news website Detik.com reported that Prabowo Subianto had pulled his election observers out of the final stages of the official count and announced his rejection of the result. At the same time, key figures in his coalition, including the leaders of the powerful Golkar Party, were urging Mr Subianto to concede defeat and abandon plans to mount a challenge through the constitutional court. A headline on Detik.com which has been retweeted several hundred times says: ""The statement rejecting the election was in Prabowo's name alone"". After Mr Subianto's defiant withdrawal from the electoral process, his own spokesman, former constitutional court justice Mohammad Mahfud, resigned. On his Facebook page, Mr Subianto continued to claim that electoral violations in Papua, East Java and Jakarta made the official result suspect, although the deficit is so great - over 8 million votes - that it would not be affected by those results being overturned. The candidate tipped to win, Joko Widodo, told the Jakarta Globe: ""I'm sure Prabowo, as a statesman, will put the national interest above all."" On social media the mood turned against Prabowo Subianto, with one of the top trending tweets being a play on an English phrase: ""Let it go Prabowo"". The hashtag #presidenbaru (""new president"") was also a vehicle for mockery of Prabowo, with many tweets containing terms like ""drama queen"", ""cry baby"" and ""sore loser"". The outgoing leader, Mr Yudhoyono, has called for calm, urging all Indonesians ""to safeguard the final chapter of the election process"". ""It is important to value our unity, brotherhood and togetherness. When a nation is divided, to reunite is not easy,"" he said at a meeting on Sunday with both candidates. On Monday Mr Yudhoyono - whose party backs Mr Subianto - also appeared to suggest that he should accept the results, saying: ""Conceding defeat is noble."" Candidates have two weeks to appeal to the constitutional court following the announcement of official results. About 130 million votes were cast on 9 July following an intense election campaign. The race has been seen as a contest between new and old-style politics. Mr Widodo draws his support from the grass-roots and is unconnected to the traditional elite. Mr Subianto, meanwhile, is the son-in-law of Suharto and has faced multiple questions over alleged human rights abuses under his regime.","Indonesian presidential election candidate Prabowo Subianto has said he is withdrawing from the election process, alleging massive fraud."
"A gang-rape trial involving Li Tianyi (also known as Li Guanfeng), the teenage son of an army general who is famous in China for singing revolutionary songs, is fuelling public anger over the behaviour of children of the elite who are perceived as over-privileged, arrogant and above the law. On the opening day of the trial in Beijing on Wednesday, media report that Li Tianyi pleaded not guilty to gang raping a woman in a hotel in February. The case is a closed-door trial because it involves minors, whose privacy must be protected by law. However, the case is still on the front pages of most newspapers because of huge public interest. ""A large amount of public discontent has poured out at Li Tianyi's case... Many people want him to pay a heavier price than offenders from ordinary family backgrounds... The court should treat Li Tianyi as an ordinary minor... The court should forget who Li Tianyi is the son of,"" says the Global Times. The hearing continues today. Another major scandal that is dominating the media is an ongoing investigation into detained Guangdong native and US citizen Charles Xue (also known as Xue Manzi) for allegedly hiring prostitutes for ""sex parties"". Mr Xue has been shown on state television appearing to have ""confessed"" to the charges. However, Mr Xue's detention coincides with a widening crackdown on ""big Vs"", or well-known microbloggers or internet commentators, on all kinds of charges such as ""online rumour mongering"" or simply venting anger at the authorities. ""In the social media environment, internet Big Vs have a certain reputation and influence... Internet big Vs should take 'Xue Manzi' as a warning to adhere strictly to a moral and legal bottom line,"" comments the People's Daily. ""We believe Xue Manzi should indeed 'admit defeat'. His supporters should not continue to defend him. If liberals 'wash away' Xue Manzi's soliciting of prostitutes, this is definitely not a wise move. It cannot save Xue's reputation... We hope that this incident is not over-'politicised',"" stresses the Global Times. Syria warning Turning to international news, China's official media warn again that a US-led military strike on Syrian government forces will violate international law if there is no credible evidence from United Nations weapons inspectors that Bashar al-Assad's forces are using chemical weapons. ""By putting the blame on the government before the UN chemical weapons inspectors complete their independent investigations and reach an authentic and credible conclusion, they are acting as judge, jury and executioner. The international community should exercise patience instead of allowing itself to be led by the nose by US intelligence, which after all was responsible for claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" says the state-run China Daily. ""Unfortunately, the US and some other Western countries seem to have decided on a 'presumption of guilt' instead of an objective investigation and on military intervention instead of political dialogue... The international community can only remain vigilant against such brazen hegemonist acts,"" says a front-page commentary in the People's Daily Overseas Edition, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some newspapers are praising New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra for its handling of a botulism scare that sparked global recalls of its milk products earlier this month. New Zealand officials say that further tests of the products have revealed a different strain of bacteria that posed no danger to consumers. ""The 'false alarm' triggered by the Fonterra tainted dairy incident is very instructive. This case has provided a model for how businesses and governments should act when faced with food safety incidents,"" says The Beijing News.

"By Laurence PeterBBC News Argentina has given up trying to rescue the 44 crew aboard the ARA San Juan, which disappeared on 15 November. But it still wants to find the diesel-electric submarine. Enter the Yantar, officially an oceanographic research vessel, but actually bristling with surveillance equipment, and the mother ship for manned and unmanned deep-sea submersibles. A Russian ROV - remotely operated underwater vehicle - is scouring the ocean floor off Argentina. But what else has the Yantar (Russian for ""amber"") been up to? Targeting undersea cables The Yantar's movements were apparently what prompted a warning last month from the UK military that Russia could disrupt or cut vital undersea communications cables. The chief of the UK defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, said such a strike against internet and other communications cables could be ""catastrophic"". Dozens of fibre-optic cables span the globe and Nato also has dedicated military cables on the ocean floor. The Yantar is capable of tampering with them, says Igor Sutyagin, a London-based expert on the Russian military. But there is no evidence that it has done so. ""It's difficult to tap into optical fibres - it's just light inside, not electrical data,"" he told the BBC. ""It would be easier just to cut the cable."" Mr Sutyagin noted that in the 1970s, during the Cold War, the US Navy had lost control of a Sosus undersea listening post for tracking submarines in the Atlantic. Sosus stands for ""Sound Surveillance System"". The US military concluded that a Soviet submarine had cut the cables. In the same period the US military, reports say, planted listening devices on Soviet undersea cables in the Sea of Okhotsk, where Soviet submarines were based. A news report from the Russian parliament says the Yantar can do just such clandestine work, using deep-diving submersibles. ""The Yantar has equipment designed for deep-sea tracking, and devices that can connect to top-secret communications cables,"" said Parlamentskaya Gazeta (in Russian) last October. Read more on Russia's military: Mr Sutyagin, of the Royal United Services Institute, says the Yantar belongs to Russia's Main Directorate of Underwater Research (GUGI in Russian), part of the defence ministry. The 108m-long (354ft) vessel has a crew of 60 and went into service in 2015. It was built in the Baltic port of Kaliningrad, the first in a series called Project 22010. A second, called Almaz, will soon be on its way to the navy. Russia already has several older spy ships. In April, one of them, the Liman, sank off the Turkish coast after being breached in a collision with a freighter. All its crew were rescued. The Yantar can deploy the three-man submersibles Rus and Konsul, which can dive to about 6,000m (20,000ft). Spying on the US The Russian parliamentary report noted that in the summer of 2015 the Yantar had deployed near the US Kings Bay naval base in Georgia. ""According to Pentagon officials, the Russians were gathering intelligence on US submarines' equipment, including underwater sensors in the DoDIN network,"" the Russian report said. Kings Bay is home to six US Trident ballistic missile submarines, each of them armed with 24 nuclear missiles, naval-technology website reports. Mr Sutyagin said the US underwater sensors near Kings Bay would be interesting for the Russian military, which might wish to copy the US technology. Pentagon concern about the Yantar's cable-cutting potential was reported by the Washington Times. In late 2016 the Yantar was found to be loitering over undersea communications cables off the Syrian coast, including some links to Europe. The ship's strange movements were tracked by a website called Covert Shores. The Yantar's frequent stops at points along a cable route suggested that a submersible was examining the sea floor, the report said. Search and rescue Besides the Argentina mission, the Yantar has been used previously for search and recovery. The Russian parliamentary report said the ship had located two Russian fighter jets - a Su-33 and a MiG-29 - that crashed into the Mediterranean in 2016, during the Syria war. The Yantar ""recovered secret equipment from the planes in good time"", the report said. That could be secret radar or missile data, or the ""identification, friend or foe"" system, Mr Sutyagin said. The disappearance of the Argentine submarine rekindled memories of Russia's Kursk submarine tragedy of 2000. In 2000 a ship like the Yantar might have saved some Kursk sailors' lives and literally salvaged the Russian navy's reputation. Mystery of ARA San Juan","The Russian navy is very proud of its new spy ship, the Yantar, which is now doing Argentina a favour by helping to search for a missing submarine."
"By Paul MellyAfrica analyst He described Faustin-Archange TouadÃ©ra as a ""hostage"" of Wagner, a Russian military contractor that has been helping the CAR government fight rebels threatening to overrun the capital, Bangui. Paris is also angered by the anti-French social media messages that emanate from sources close to Mr TouadÃ©ra, stirring up resentment against the former colonial power. It was the intervention by French and African troops in 2013 that saved CAR from a potentially genocidal civil conflict and created the conditions for the democratic elections that brought Mr TouadÃ©ra to power in 2016. But the CAR now relies heavily on Russian military expertise and has also signed mining deals with Russia, allowing it to explore for gold, diamonds and uranium. Uneasy about the lurch towards Moscow and angered by the anti-French rhetoric, Mr Macron has suspended budget support for the CAR government. Mr Macron also concluded that a blunt public warning was needed, through a now widely publicised 30 May interview with the Journal du Dimanche (JDD). His outspoken words met with no direct response, although Mr TouadÃ©ra's government says its arrangement is with the Russian defence ministry rather than Wagner. But the Central African head of state was not the only target of his plain speaking. He warned Mali - where interim Vice-President Colonel Assimi GoÃ¯ta has staged a fresh coup to depose the president and prime minister - that French troops deployed to help in the fight against militant Islamists could be pulled out if the West African state went down the path of Islamist radicalism. The JDD interview was widely reported in Francophone media. Mr Macron certainly knows how to get attention. While warning Mali's transitional leaders against cutting a soft deal with jihadists, his comments perhaps also sought to reassure voters back home that French troops in the Sahel region were not being asked to put their lives on the line in vain. Mr Macron's style certainly contrasts with the clubby networking that used to characterise so much of the relationships between French presidents and African political Ã©lites - a sometimes complacent culture, summed up in the term FranÃ§afrique. This tended to reinforce incumbent power rather than responding to wider demands for reform or social and economic development. Macron's 'arrogant' style Mr Macron has faced African issues head-on, and with a much greater degree of openness. He is not afraid to publicly make the case for change. This can certainly produce results - as illustrated by a visit last week to Rwanda, where he made a straightforward admission of France's failings in the run-up to the 1994 genocide, in a gesture that aimed to lay the foundations for building a new relationship that moves forward from the bitterness left by past history. But his personalised style, with its direct language and occasional impatience with diplomatic protocol, is a high-wire act that can appear arrogant. The four years of his presidential engagement with Africa have been marred by sporadic incidents of offence or high-handedness that fuel the always combustible sense of resentment towards France as a former colonial power, particularly among younger Africans. Return of looted artefacts But those four years have also been marked by a brave readiness to pro-actively tackle awkward issues and explore new ways of doing things. Mr Macron has commissioned academics to write three independent reports researching French behaviour: during the bloody independence conflict in Algeria; the Rwanda genocide and the potential return to Africa of historical and cultural artefacts taken to France during the colonial era. You may also be interested in: His blunt admission of French failure in Rwanda was based on the findings of the Vincent Duclert report, which has been published in full. After receiving historian Benjamin Stora's report on Algeria in January, the French president said he would launch a series of initiatives based on its recommendations, a number of which would be organised by a Truth and Memory commission headed by Prof Stora. Critics feel that Mr Macron has not fully grasped what is required, but the implementation of recommendations in partnership with Algeria may be hampered by the North African state's current internal political difficulties. The restitution of cultural artefacts has already begun, with a sword handed over to Senegal and the crown from a royal dais returned to Madagascar, while arrangements are under way for the return of 26 items to Benin. But beyond these cultural and symbolic gestures, Mr Macron is trying to strike a difficult balance, and one that would face any French president in 2021. Paris policymakers believe that Africa is a continent of huge importance, a near neighbour to Europe with fast-growing populations and economies but facing deep development challenges. Tension over 'colonial' currency France, and indeed the European Union, should therefore remain heavily engaged - through political relationships, development assistance rising to 0.55% of gross national income in 2022 and a continued military presence, particularly to tackle militant groups and support efforts to stabilise the Sahel - a semi-arid stretch of land just south of the Sahara Desert which includes Mali, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. But the very scale of this engagement can also leave Paris exposed to accusations of post-colonial interference. This is well illustrated by efforts to reform the CFA franc, a currency used by 14 countries that is pegged to the euro under a French government guarantee - an arrangement that keeps inflation low but constrains monetary independence. Back in 2017 Mr Macron said that if West African governments chose to reform the currency, his country would support them. A limited first stage relaxation of French control was announced in December 2019. But popular and intellectual demands for more far-reaching change persist and France continues to be accused of seeking to maintain indirect control - even though, in reality, the further reform depends on overcoming serious technical challenges, and political differences among West African governments. In the Sahel some critics accuse Paris of keeping troops deployed to protect its economic interests. France is indeed heavily invested in Niger's uranium mining - but the lucrative Sahelian gold mining sector is actually dominated by Canadian, Russian, Australian and British companies. Mr Macron has tried to change the tone of French relationships with Africa. But there is deep resentment and mistrust to be overcome and the choice of language is crucial. Striking that right note is never easy. When he spoke at the funeral of Chad's late President Idriss DÃ©by in April, Mr Macron's declaration of support for the country's stability and territorial integrity were widely interpreted as backing for the new junta headed by DÃ©by's son Mahamat. Yet in fact he had also called for inclusiveness, dialogue and a democratic transition - points that went much less remarked. Paul Melly is a Consulting Fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.","French President Emmanuel Macron has once again resorted to outspoken language as a tool of diplomatic strategy, this time targeting the president of the Central African Republic (CAR)."
"A $1.6m gold and diamond necklace, 14 tiaras and 272 Hermes bags were taken as part of corruption investigations into state investment fund 1MDB. Billions of dollars are unaccounted for from the fund, set up by Mr Najib. He has been under investigation since his shock election loss in May. Police describe the seizure of valuables as the biggest in Malaysian history. Jewellery accounted for the biggest portion, with 12,000 items gathered - the most expensive being the $1.6m necklace. A total of 567 handbags containing almost $30m in cash were also seized, along with 423 watches and 234 pairs of sunglasses, police say. ""We couldn't do the counting at the premises because the numbers were too huge,"" Amar Singh, head of the police commercial crime division, told a news conference. He added that it had taken officials five weeks to count the items and calculate their value. Over the years Ms Rosmah has come to be known for her indulgent shopping habits and love of branded goods. She has been compared to former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos, who was also known for her love of shoes and other luxury goods. Corruption claims were a major cause of Mr Najib's election loss to his former ally Mahathir Mohammad. Mr Najib was alleged to have pocketed $700m from the fund, a charge he has denied. Since he lost the election, Mr Najib and his wife have been questioned by anti-graft investigators and he has been banned from leaving the country.","Malaysian police have seized a trove of jewellery, handbags and cash worth up to $273m (Â£206m) from properties linked to former prime minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor."
"Tests had found some of the Indian-manufactured Life Guard brand contained holes or risked bursting, Uganda's National Drug Authority (NDA) said. Marie Stopes provides contraception and family planning services in more than 35 countries. Nearly 6% of adults in Uganda live with HIV, the UN says. Other research suggests that only 11% of people in the country have planned pregnancies. Marie Stopes supplies between 1.5 million and two million condoms to Uganda every month. ""We can confirm this is the first time that one of our country programmes has needed to issue this kind of recall,"" it said in a statement to the BBC. The recall came after the NDA wrote to the charity on 30 October, saying two batches of Life Guard condoms failed to comply with ""quality tests"". Marie Stopes said it was working with the NDA to ""urgently investigate what happened with these batches and ensure our products continue to meet the high standard of quality"". ""We can confirm that the two batches we are recalling contained around 335,000 condom packs - just over 1 million individual condoms. We have recovered more than half of those,"" it added.","A leading charity, Marie Stopes, says it has recalled more than a million condoms distributed in Uganda following concerns about their safe use."
"Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby. Mayor Olaf Scholz said the attack was motivated by ""hate"" but did not say it was a terror attack. There are unconfirmed reports that the man shouted ""Allahu akhbar"", Arabic for ""God is great"" while attacking people. Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality. Mr Sholz said he was a failed asylum seeker. The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers. Mobile phone footage on German media that is purportedly of the attack's aftermath shows several people chasing a man and throwing chairs at him. A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect. The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain. Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife. One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was. Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: ""We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues."" Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed. One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed ""hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack"".",A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket.

"The former political consultant had worked on Republican presidential campaigns as far back as Gerald Ford's in 1976, and for clients around the world. It was hoped his 40 years of political experience would help temper some of the chaos and controversy surrounding Mr Trump. He advocated a more disciplined, conventional campaign, calling for scripted speeches and teleprompters over Mr Trump's unpredictable, off-the-cuff, approach. Manafort was soon promoted to chair the campaign and oversaw the period during which Mr Trump clinched the Republican nomination. However, he ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle. He was convicted on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and sentenced to nearly four years in prison. 'Silly and nonsensical' Born in New Britain, Connecticut, on 1 April 1949, Paul Manafort took law at Georgetown University. Other Republicans he worked for include the late President Ronald Reagan, former President George HW Bush and Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election. Before he became involved in the former Soviet Union he worked for such figures as the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, the late leader of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) Mobutu Sese Seko and the late Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. But on the Trump trail, it was his more recent work in Ukraine that raised questions. While Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. His tenure at the helm ended in August 2016 when he resigned after reports about his consultancy work for Ukraine's deposed pro-Russian former President, Viktor Yanukovych, when he was in office. The New York Times reported that the Ukrainian government had uncovered ledgers pledging more than $12m (Â£9.2m) in cash payments for his work as an adviser to Mr Yanukovych. He vehemently dismissed the allegations and denied any wrongdoing. ""The suggestion that I accepted cash payments is unfounded, silly, and nonsensical,"" he told NBC News. Any political payments directed to him he said ""were for my entire political team: campaign staff, polling and research, election integrity and television advertising"". The Trump campaign did not give a reason for his departure, issuing only a standard statement wishing him well. Since then, the controversy around Manafort's ties to Russia has continued to grow. FBI raid It has also been alleged that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political goals in other parts of the former USSR. Manafort denied the allegation. In June 2017, he retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the US justice department in relation to his consulting work between 2012-14 for Mr Yanukovych's political party in Ukraine. He confirmed in a declaration that his firm, DMP International, had received more than $17m from the Party of the Regions. Then, in July, President Trump's son admitted to having met a Russian lawyer before the election who promised to reveal damaging material on Hillary Clinton. Manafort was reportedly at that meeting. The following month, Manafort's spokesman confirmed the FBI had conducted a pre-dawn raid on his Virginia home, seizing files and other material. It was later reported that Manafort had been wiretapped by the FBI due to concerns about his links with Moscow. The surveillance, granted under a court warrant, is said to have occurred both before and after the election. The FBI is leading one of several investigations into alleged Russian interference in last year's US election. What was he convicted of? Of 18 charges against him, Manafort was found guilty of eight in August. He filed a false tax return every year from 2010 to 2014, did not report a foreign bank account as required by law in 2012, and committed two instances of bank fraud related to two separate bank loans. However, the jury at his trial in Virginia failed to reach a verdict on 10 other charges and the judge declared a mistrial on those. The indictments are not connected with allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the US election in 2016. But he later agreed to co-operate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into that matter, in a plea deal that had potential ramifications for the White House. A judge later found that Manafort had breached the deal by contacting witnesses to ask them to lie, and ordered him held in plea-trial detention. In March he was sentenced to 47 years by Judge TS Ellis who told him he was surprised that Manafort did not ""express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct"".","When Paul Manafort joined Donald Trump's presidential election campaign in March 2016, the 68-year-old political operative was a relatively minor player in Washington."
"Sixty new cases were reported in the past week, bringing this year's total to 971 cases in 26 US states - the highest since 1994. The disease was declared effectively eliminated from the US in 2000. Recent outbreaks have been attributed to foreign travellers spreading it to those lacking vaccinations in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Thursday: ""If these outbreaks continue through summer and fall, the United States may lose its measles elimination status. ""That loss would be a huge blow for the nation and erase the hard work done by all levels of public health. ""The measles elimination goal, first announced in 1963 and accomplished in 2000, was a monumental task."" The statement added that previously between three and four million Americans were diagnosed with the sometimes-fatal illness each year, leading to an estimated 400-500 deaths and 48,000 hospitalisations. Earlier this year, Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases testified to lawmakers that more must be done to prevent the spread of the disease. ""I consider it an irony that you have one of the most contagious viruses known to man juxtaposed against one of the most effective vaccines they have,"" he said. ""Yet we don't do and have not done what could be done - namely eliminate, eradicate the virus."" This year's tally of 971 means the US has already broken the 1994 record - 963 infections - in only the first five months of 2019. But it is still not as bad as 1992 when about 2,200 cases of measles were reported.","The number of US measles patients has reached a record high and may cause the nation to lose its ""measles elimination status"", US health officials say."
"Paramilitary forces fired bullets and shotgun pellets as people protesting against Indian rule stormed polling stations near Srinagar on Sunday. Separatist leaders had called for a boycott of the vote. Muslim-majority Kashmir is at the centre of a decades-old territorial dispute between India and Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of supporting separatist sentiment in Kashmir, but Islamabad denies this. Both countries claim Kashmir in its entirety and control different parts of it. The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July last year when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. Reports said the voter turnout in Sunday's election was a mere 7% - the lowest in three decades. Two schools were set on fire by unknown protesters, The Times of India reported. Security was tightened on Monday across the region - roads were blocked with barricades and some train services were also suspended. Why were they protesting? Rebel groups in Indian-administered Kashmir have for decades called for either independence or a union with Pakistan. These groups have rejected local elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the ""anti-people"" agenda of the Indian government. The Indian government deployed tight security ahead of the polling, with 20,000 additional troops sent to the area. Internet services were also shut down in an attempt to hold a peaceful poll. How did the violence escalate? On Sunday thousands of protesters charged into polling stations in the Budgam district. The state's chief electoral officer Shantmanu told AFP news agency that protesters damaged and snatched voting machines. Clashes erupted when police and troops moved in and used tear gas - and later opened fire - on protesters, who fought back by pelting stones. Mr Shantmanu told reporters later that there were more than 200 incidents of violence including petrol bomb attacks and a polling station set on fire. What happened to the by-election? Polling had to be suspended in some places, while voters generally stayed away. Another by-election, to fill a separate parliamentary seat, is set to take place in the Anantnag district on 12 April. The results of both polls are expected on 15 April. Farooq Abdullah, a former chief minister for Indian-administered Kashmir and a candidate for the by-election, has condemned the violence. He told reporters: ""Elections should have been peaceful. This government has failed in giving a peaceful atmosphere for people to come and vote.""",Eight people have been killed and scores injured after police clashed with protesters during a by-election in Indian-administered Kashmir.
"Tahira was denied justice in life, but she continues to plead for it in death - thanks to a grainy recording on a mobile phone. As she lay dying last year the young Pakistan wife and mother made a statement for use in court. In the shaky amateur video, she named her tormentors, and said they should burn like she did. Tahira's flesh was singed on 35% of her body, following a suspected acid attack. Her speech was laboured and her voice was hoarse, but she was determined to give her account of the attack, even as her flesh was falling off her bones. ""I told her you must speak up and tell us what happened,"" her mother Jan Bano said, dabbed her tears with her white headscarf. ""And she was talking until her last breath."" Tahira's husband, mother-in-law, and father-in-law were acquitted this month of attacking her with acid. Her mother plans to appeal against that verdict, with help from a new ally - Pakistan's first female jirga. Under the traditional - and controversial - jirga system, elders gather to settle disputes. Until now this parallel justice system has been men-only, and rulings have often discriminated against women. The new all-women jirga, which has about 25 members, aims to deliver its own brand of justice. It has been established in an unlikely setting - the scenic but conservative Swat valley, formerly under the control of the Pakistan Taliban. We sat in on one of its sessions in a sparsely furnished front room. Women crowded in, sitting in a circle on the floor, many with children at their feet. Most wore headscarves, and a few were concealed in burqas. Probing injustice For more than an hour they discussed a land dispute, problems with the water supply, unpaid salaries, and murder. The only man in the room was a local lawyer, Suhail Sultan. He was giving legal advice to jirga members including Jan Bano who he represents. ""In your case the police is the bad guy,"" he told her. ""They are the biggest enemy. "" He claims the police were bribed by the accused, and were reluctant to investigate the case properly. The jirga is making history, and perhaps making enemies. In Swat, as in many parts of Pakistan, men make the key decisions - like whether or not their daughters go to school, when they marry, and who they marry. And oppression starts early. Tahira was married off at just 12 years old, to a middle-aged man. ""Our society is a male-dominated society, and our men treat our women like slaves,"" said the jirga founder, Tabassum Adnan. ""They don't give them their rights and they consider them their property. Our society doesn't think we have the right to live our own lives."" This chatty social activist, and mother of four, knows that challenging culture and tradition comes with risks. ""Maybe I could be killed,"" she said, ""anything could happen. But I have to fight. I am not going to stop."" As we spoke in a sun-baked courtyard Tabassum got a disturbing phone call. ""I have just been told that the body of another girl has been found, "" she said. "" Her husband shot her."" She plans to investigate the case, and push the authorities to act. ""Before my jirga women have always been ignored by the police and by justice, but not now. My jirga has done a lot for women,"" she said. There was agreement from Taj Mehal, a bereaved mother with a careworn face, sitting across the courtyard on a woven bed. Her beloved daughter Nurina was tortured to death in May. ""They broke her arm in three places, and they strangled her,"" she told me, putting her hands to her own throat to mimic the action. ""They broke her collarbone. They glued her mouth and eyes closed. Just her face was left, the rest was flesh and broken bones."" She speaks of her daughter's suffering with a steady voice, but grief is wrapped around her, like a heavy shawl. ""When I looked at her, it was like a piece was pulled out of my heart,"" she said. ""I was turned to stone. I see her face in front of my eyes. I miss her laughter."" Nurina's husband, and his parents, have now been charged with her murder, but her mother says that initially the courts took no interest. ""Whenever we brought applications to the judge he would tear them up and throw them away,"" she said. ""Now our voice is being heard, because of the jirga. Now we will get justice. Before the jirga husbands could do whatever they wanted to their wives."" Women are little seen or heard on the bustling streets of Mingora, the biggest city in Swat. Rickshaw taxis dart past small shops selling medicines, and hardware supplies. There are stalls weighed down with mangoes, and vendors dropping dough into boiling oil to make sugar-laden treats. Most of the shoppers are men. 'No justice' at jirgas When we asked some of the local men their views on the women's jirga, the results were surprising. Most backed the women. ""It's a very good thing,"" said one fruit seller, ""women should know about their rights like men do, and they should be given their rights."" Another said: ""The jirga is good because now finally women have someone to champion their cause."" The response from the local male jirga was less surprising. They were dismissive, saying the women have no power to enforce their decisions. That view was echoed by the prominent Pakistani human rights activist Tahira Abdullah. ""I don't see it as more than a gimmick,"" she said. ""Who is going to listen to these women? The men with the Kalashnikovs? The Taliban who are anti-women? The patriarchal culture that we have?"" Ms Abdullah wants jirgas stopped whether male or female. ""The jirga system is totally illegal, and has been declared illegal by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. It can never be just. There are several extremely notorious cases where we have noticed that women do not get justice from jirgas, neither do non-Muslims."" One of those cases took place last year in a remote region of northern Pakistan where a jirga allegedly ordered the killing of five women - and two men - for defying local customs by singing and dancing together at a wedding. And there are regular reports of jirgas decreeing that women and young girls be handed over from one family to another to settle disputes. But for some, like Jan Bano, the women's jirga is bringing hope. Every day she climbs a steep hill to visit Tahira's grave, and pray for the daughter whose voice has still not her heard. Her video recording was not played in court.","Women in Pakistan's Swat valley are making history, and perhaps some powerful enemies, by convening an all-female jirga, a forum for resolving disputes usually reserved for men. Some readers may find details of this report by the BBC's Orla Guerin disturbing."
"He was accused of obstructing investigations into a major corruption scandal at the state-owned oil company, Petrobras. Mr Amaral has been suspended for 60 days, but influential party leaders had called for his expulsion. The Workers Party has distanced itself from the senator since his arrest. An internal investigation will decide whether Mr Amaral should be expelled. The senator had been secretly recorded apparently discussing plans to help a detained official flee the country in return for not implicating Mr Amaral in the scandal. The official, Nestor Cervero, was accused of masterminding the corruption scheme. He signed a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors. 'No solidarity' At the time of Mr Amaral's arrest, the president of the Workers Party, Rui Falcao, published a statement saying he was ""perplexed by the facts"" that led to the arrest. ""None of the acts attributed to the senator is connected to his activities for the party. ""For that reason, the Workers Party does not feel obliged to lend him any solidarity,"" added Mr Falcao. Other influential members of Brazil's Workers Party, including the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, have openly criticised the senator. One of Brazil's richest men, banker Andre Esteves, was also arrested on 26 November as part of the same operation. Federal police said he was also involved in the plot to help Mr Cervero flee to Spain. Mr Esteves is Brazil's 13th richest man, worth an estimated $2.5bn (Â£1.7bn), while Mr Amaral is the first sitting legislator to be detained in the scandal. Both men deny the charges. President Dilma Rousseff has not been implicated in the scandal, but the allegations against senior members of the Workers Party have led to a sharp drop in her popularity since she was re-elected last year. On Wednesday, the speaker of the lower house of Congress opened impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. The process is based on allegations Ms Rousseff broke the law in managing last year's budget.","Brazil's governing Workers Party has suspended its former leader in the Senate, Delcidio Amaral, who was arrested last week."

"Under that deal Mr Balladur, now aged 90, allegedly got funding for his failed 1995 bid for the presidency. His then Defence Minister, FranÃ§ois LÃ©otard, also faces trial. Both men categorically deny any wrongdoing. In 2002 a bombing in Karachi killed 11 French engineers. There are suspicions that the car bombing, which wrecked a bus, was an act of revenge after President Jacques Chirac had ordered payment of the secret arms deal commissions to stop. Attorney General FranÃ§ois Molins announced that Mr Balladur and Mr LÃ©otard would go before a special tribunal for present and past government officials accused of wrongdoing. The allegation is that Mr Balladur approved payment of the commissions to intermediaries in the sale of three submarines to Pakistan, and that from them so-called ""retro-commissions"" came back to France to fund his presidential bid. The kickbacks are estimated to have cost 13m francs (almost â¬2m, or Â£1.8m, in today's money). Mr Balladur was prime minister from 1993 to 1995. Both he and Mr LÃ©otard were charged in May 2017 with ""complicity in misuse of corporate assets and concealment"" over the Pakistan deal. Pakistani authorities blamed Islamist militants for the 2002 bombing, which killed 15 people in total. The 11 French engineers who died were working on the Agosta-class submarine contract. Long-running investigations into the crime are continuing. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy - a conservative who was close to Mr Balladur - also came under legal scrutiny over the Karachi affair. He denied any connection to the deal. Separately, on Tuesday Mr Sarkozy lost his legal appeal to avoid facing trial over allegations that his failed re-election campaign in 2012 was financed illegally. France's top appeals court has returned the case to prosecutors to decide if Mr Sarkozy should be tried. He denies accusations that his party, known then as the UMP, used a public relations firm to hide the real cost of his presidential bid. The case is known in France as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the public relations firm that allegedly provided false invoices to help Mr Sarkozy.",Former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and an ex-defence minister are to stand trial over the so-called Karachi affair - a submarine deal with Pakistan in the mid-1990s which allegedly involved secret commissions.
"The Government Accountability Office discovered the agencies tasked with enforcing the policy in April ""did not plan"" for an influx in jailed children. The ""zero tolerance"" policy saw nearly 3,000 migrant children separated from parents before it was suspended. The report comes as a caravan of nearly 7,000 migrants seek refuge in the US. The new findings were released to the public on 24 October, though the report had been published on 9 October. Congressional investigators with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) interviewed officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They found that these agencies had not planned for the increase in children separated from parents or guardians as a result of the ""zero tolerance"" policy, because they were unaware the policy was forthcoming. ""These officials told GAO that they were unaware of the memo in advance of its public release,"" the report - which was requested by House Democrats - states. ""Prior to April 2018, DHS and HHS did not have a consistent way to indicate in their data systems children and parents separated at the border."" In April and July, border officials and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) were able to update databases to mark separated children, according to the report. However, GAO notes that it is too soon to know if those changes ""will consistently indicate when children have been separated...or will help reunify families"". As of 10 September, 437 children remain in ORR custody ""for various reasons, such as ineligibility for reunification"", GAO reported. Katie Waldman of DHS told the BBC in an emailed statement that both DHS and HHS ""have worked tirelessly"" towards reunification but did not comment on specifics in the report. A justice department spokesperson told CBS News it was ""not very credible"" to say DHS was ""unaware"" of the policy as Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced it at a news conference alongside acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Thomas Homan. Immigration activists have long claimed that there was no official protocol in place to track parents and their separated children, which led to major difficulties in identifying children in government custody. Some government officials even suggested DNA tests during the thick of the separation crisis, which some critics took as proof that there had been no clear policy in place. What happened in April? The ""zero-tolerance"" policy meant adults illegally crossing the border, even if they were asylum-seekers, were placed in custody and faced criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As children cannot legally be jailed with their parents, migrant children were separated and housed in detention centres, in the custody of HHS. But activists at the border said that even families crossing through a port of entry were being targeted. Under previous US administrations, immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses and released. In June, amid fierce criticism across the country and worldwide, President Donald Trump backed down on the policy and signed an executive order to ""keep families together"". What will happen with new migrants? Of the 1,500 migrants who arrived in the last caravan, only about 250 are legally still in the US, humanitarian organisation Pueblos sin Fronteras told CBS News. And now, a second caravan of Central American migrants is making its way northward. The president has lashed out against the migrants and their home countries, threatening to cut all aid and use military force to close the US border. The migrants, mostly from Honduras, say they are fleeing poverty and violence. Most are still hoping to seek asylum in the US. Under Mr Trump's June executive order, families caught crossing illegally can remain together in detention, but children are only allowed to be held for 20 days, according to a 21-year-old landmark court decision known as the Flores agreement. DHS spokeswoman Ms Waldman told the BBC in a statement that the department would continue to refer illegal immigrants for prosecution. ""Unfortunately, the number of families crossing the south-west border illegally is increasing. This means that there may be a proportional increase in cases where adults are separated from children due to concerns about parentage or the adult's criminal history."" Ms Waldman said that DHS had seen a 75% increase in family apprehensions since 2016 and a 315% increase in families trying to illegally enter the US.","US government agencies were blindsided by the White House's policy to separate families caught illegally crossing the border, reports a government watchdog."
"An ""in-depth investigation"" will look into claims made by Veracruz governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares on Monday, the Ministry of Health said. He alleged fake medicine had been bought and used in state hospitals under his predecessor Javier Duarte. Mr Duarte has been on the run from the authorities since October. The former governor, who was elected in 2010, has not been seen since a week after he stepped down amid allegations of corruption. He has been charged with organised crime and money laundering, but there are calls for the Attorney General's office to file criminal charges relating to the latest accusations. On Monday, Mr Yunes Linares told a press conference that an investigation into malfeasance and corruption under Mr Duarte had uncovered medical fraud. `We have tests on a medication given to children, a paediatric chemotherapy that wasn't really a medication, it was an inert substance, practically distilled water,'' he said. ""This really seems to us a brutal crime, an attempt against the lives of the children. We're finishing our analysis and, at the appropriate time, we'll be filing legal complaints."" Mr Yunes Linares also alleged there had been inadequate tests for HIV detection and the existence of outdated medicines. The allegations have shocked Mexico. ""It is absolutely inhuman, criminal,"" Senator Roberto Gil Zuart said, according to Mexican news site Quadratin. Mexico's Secretary of Health JosÃ© Narro Robles has promised to act on ""the persons or companies involved"" if irregularities or responsibility is found, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.","Mexican authorities are to investigate allegations children battling cancer were given ""distilled water"" instead of chemotherapy."
"Prince Joachim, 28, travelled from Belgium to Spain for an internship on 26 May, the palace said. Two days later, he went to a party in the southern city of CÃ³rdoba, before testing positive for Covid-19. Spanish reports suggest the prince, a nephew of Belgium's King Philippe, was among 27 people at the party. Under CÃ³rdoba's lockdown rules, a party of this size would be a breach of regulations, as gatherings of no more than 15 people are currently permitted. Spanish police have launched an investigation into the party. Those found to have flouted lockdown rules could be fined up to â¬10,000 (Â£9,000; $11,100). Everyone who attended the party is said to be in quarantine. Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Princess Astrid and 10th in line to the Belgian throne, is said to have mild coronavirus symptoms. Rafaela Valenzuela, a representative of the Spanish government in CÃ³rdoba, condemned the party, calling those who attended ""irresponsible"". ""I feel surprised and angry. An incident of this type stands out at a moment of national mourning for so many dead,"" she said. The party was first covered by Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, which cited a document from the Andalucian authorities but did not name the prince. Belgian media have since confirmed with the palace that Prince Joachim was in Spain, where he remains. The prince is known to have a long-standing relationship with a Spanish woman, reported to be Victoria Ortiz. Spain is in the process of emerging from one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. It outlined a four-stage plan on 4 May to start easing the lockdown, which saw children under 14 confined to their homes for six weeks. The country said it was moving to a second phase from 1 June for 70% of Spaniards, leaving only major cities under tighter restrictions. Spain has among the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world. As of Saturday, the country had 239,228 infections and 27,125 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.","A Belgian prince has contracted coronavirus after attending a party during lockdown in Spain, the country's royal palace says."
"Another commanding officer had been ""administratively sanctioned"" and five more would be given counselling, a defence department statement said. The incursions took place as the navy took part in border operations under a policy aimed at preventing asylum seekers reaching Australian shores. Australia has apologised, saying the incursions took place ""inadvertently"". ""The Chief of Navy accepts that none of the commanding officers involved deliberately contravened orders not to enter Indonesian territorial waters,"" a statement said. ""Notwithstanding, there were, in the Chief of Navy's view, lapses in professional conduct that required action to be taken."" In each case, there had been a ""clear operational direction not to proceed within 12 nautical miles from the Indonesian archipelagic baseline"". The positioning of each ship was considered and each commanding officer's perspective was heard, the statement said. The government has not revealed details of the incidents, but they are believed to have taken place as navy vessels forced Australia-bound boats carrying asylum seekers back to Indonesia, under a new policy called Operation Sovereign Borders. Indonesia has described the policy as unhelpful and the issue has strained ties between the two economic allies. Indonesia serves as a transit point for people smugglers, who ferry asylum seekers to Christmas Island, the closest part of Australian territory, on rickety and over-crowded boats. Many people have died making the journey. The Australian government says its tough new policy is successfully deterring asylum boats, with no new arrivals since December. Rights groups have accused Australia of shirking its international obligations, however. Its asylum policy is also in the spotlight after a young Iranian man died in violence at an Australian immigration detention centre in Papua New Guinea in February. Several inquiries into who caused the young man's death are under way.",An Australian navy captain has been removed from his command for violating Indonesia's territorial waters.
"Col Abdoulaye Ahmat Haroun had just been handed a five-year sentence for a murder that caused national uproar. Moments later, a group of relatives, some of them armed, stormed the dock and hauled him out. But his freedom was short lived. Justice Minister Djimet Arabi said Haroun was recaptured five hours later. The incident took place on Thursday in N'Djamena, capital of the landlocked semi-desert country in north-central Africa. Haroun was charged with murder after video circulated online showing him shooting two people at point-blank range in August, killing one of them. The footage sparked an online debate, with some commentators pointing out that Haroun was from the same ethnic background as President Idriss Deby Itno, who has ruled Chad for three decades. Some said the officer had acted with ""impunity"". The debate on social media became so heated that the government cut back the speed of the internet to slow the spread of messages. Maxvelt Loalngar, head of the Chadian Human Rights League, said relatives of the colonel, some of them carrying ""military weapons"" rushed him out of court, calling the judge a ""slave"" as they went. Justice Minister Arabi told AFP news agency that ""youths and women faked a brawl"" to aid the escape. He added that police eventually recaptured the colonel ""with five accomplices, hiding in a house"". It was the second time Haroun had tried to evade justice. On 9 August, while in detention, he managed to board a plane bound for Egypt. Prosecutors ordered the plane to return to N'Djamena, where he was arrested on landing.",A court hearing in Chad descended into chaos when the family of a military officer being sentenced for murder seized him and spirited him away.
"The engine test was claimed to be a success, a ""new birth"" for North Korea's rocket industry. Kim Jong-un was certainly happy. In pictures released by state news agency KCNA, he was seen watching the missile from afar; grinning in a control centre; shaking hands with jubilant officers - then, giving an elderly man a piggyback. Who would leap onto the back of a dictator such as this, and why? Observers say the mysterious man is not a known figure in North Korean politics. He is thought to have played a key role in the engine test, and most likely interacted with Mr Kim previously. North Korean observer Michael Madden says his uniform's insignias indicate he is a mid-level officer of the KPA Strategic Force, which is in charge of missile forces used for offensive attacks. While the image was almost certainly stage-managed, ""it wasn't completely machinated or fabricated"", says Mr Madden, who is with the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. ""It was more a signal of allowance and encouragement than something completely machinated by an image maker."" North Korean propaganda films have in the past shown citizens being allowed to approach Mr Kim. 'Friendly and convivial' The main purpose of the picture would be to burnish Mr Kim's domestic image as a jovial man of the people. While Mr Kim tries to project a ""recalcitrant and uncompromising"" image internationally, at home ""it is a different story"", notes Professor Jae-Cheon Lim, of the Korea University in Seoul. ""We know he is very strict with elites when they don't obey his orders. But in general towards the people his propaganda image is friendly and convivial."" It stands in stark contrast to his predecessors, who sought to be feared more than loved. ""Nobody would dare piggyback his father or even his grandfather,"" says Mr Madden. ""But this fits into the image [Kim] Jong-un has tried to cultivate - that he is more open, on an interpersonal basis, than his father. ""It conveys a certain sense of political confidence in his rule and leadership of the country. If he didn't feel secure, then he wouldn't allow these images to be disseminated - he would need to appear distant and cold."" The image also suggests that Mr Kim is, for now, in good health. He was spotted limping and using a cane in 2014, leading to speculation that he had gout, and limping again as recently as late 2016. Borrowing from football's playbook Piggybacking after a win may be more commonly seen on football pitches rather than in North Korean propaganda pictures, but Mr Kim is known for taking a sports management approach to his weapons development programmes. ""When a test is conducted, civilian and military personnel [are told they] should regard it as a sports competition - they win some, and lose some,"" says Mr Madden. ""They won't 'win' or meet technical specifications all the time, and when they 'lose' they study their performance and what happened."" But for all its contrived spontaneity, it does not mean that Mr Kim is not genuinely happy in the photo. Prof Lim points out that he had good reason to celebrate, with an apparently successful rocket engine test putting him one step closer towards his nuclear goals - and sealing his legacy. ""In the propaganda annals, his grandfather was the liberator of Korea through its anti-Japanese guerrilla war. His father succeeded in maintaining the regime even under economic poverty. ""But Kim Jong-un became leader quickly and has no significant achievements to point to so far. ""If North Korea becomes a nuclear state, it becomes his achievement.""",North Korea's test of a rocket engine last weekend was accompanied by the usual state media propaganda - but one image of its leader celebrating stood out in particular. What is the likely explanation?
"He spoke as he revived a Korean War-era measure allowing the US to ramp up production of vital medical supplies. Two lawmakers meanwhile became the first members of Congress to test positive for the infection. The US has more than 9,300 cases of Covid-19 and has seen 150 deaths so far, according to estimates. Globally there are some 220,000 confirmed cases and over 8,800 deaths. What did President Trump say? At a White House press conference, the president was asked by a reporter whether he considered the country to be on a war footing in terms of fighting the virus. ""It's a war,"" he said. ""I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president."" Mr Trump has been holding daily briefings on the emergency this week after being accused of playing down the outbreak in its early stages. He said: ""We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together. It's the invisible enemy. That's always the toughest enemy. ""But we are going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we are going to do it even faster than we thought, and it'll be a complete victory. It'll be a total victory."" Mr Trump announced he was signing the 1950 Defense Production Act, which empowers the president to direct civilian businesses to help meet orders for products necessary for national security. But he said later on Twitter that he would only invoke the measure ""in a worst case scenario in the future"". Mr Trump also described as an ""absolute, total worst case scenario"" a warning by his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, that the pandemic could send US unemployment rocketing to 20%. The president said two US Navy hospitals ships would be pressed into service to help alleviate an expected shortage of sick beds. The USNS Comfort is expected to be sent to New York Harbor, though defence officials said it is currently undergoing maintenance in Virginia. The other vessel, USNS Mercy, is being prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast. During the press conference, Mr Trump again rejected suggestions that his use of the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe Covid-19 was racist. Earlier in the day the US-Canada border, the world's longest, was effectively closed, except for essential travel and commerce. Mr Trump also announced a new crackdown on migrants or asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border. He said his administration would invoke a statute that allows people to be blocked in order to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. Which congressmen have coronavirus? The office of Ben McAdams, a Utah Democrat, said on Wednesday evening he had tested positive for the virus. The 45-year-old said he developed ""mild cold-like symptoms"" after returning from Washington DC on Saturday evening. Mr McAdams said he immediately self-isolated at home, but ""my symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and laboured breathing"". His doctor referred him on Tuesday for a Covid-19 test, which came back positive on Wednesday, according to the statement. The representative said he would remain in self-quarantine until he had recovered. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, also announced on Wednesday he had tested positive for coronavirus. ""I'm feeling much better. However, it's important that everyone take this seriously,"" the 58-year-old tweeted from self-quarantine at his flat in Washington DC. Mr Balart said he did not plan to return to Florida, noting his wife, Tia, has underlying conditions ""that put her at exceptionally high risk"". The news will likely send a shiver through Congress, which has many elderly members. Its representatives and senators are usually eager to shake hands with the aides, colleagues, constituents and lobbyists they encounter daily. They also often find themselves at close quarters with each other while riding the dedicated subway beneath the Capitol complex. What is Congress doing to combat coronavirus? On Wednesday, the president signed a coronavirus relief package that was passed earlier in the day in the US Senate by 90-8. The bill provides free virus testing and paid sick, family and medical leave for workers at companies with 500 employees or fewer, as well as expanded funding for food welfare. It is estimated the paid leave provisions of the bill alone will cost $105bn (Â£90bn). The White House and Congress are also discussing additional coronavirus economic stimulus measures that could cost up to $1.3tn. Mr Trump has said that package might include direct payments of up to $1,000 to Americans to encourage spending. Despite efforts to sustain the economy, the Dow Jones plummeted again on Wednesday erasing nearly all the gains it has made since Mr Trump took office. How else is the US responding to coronavirus? The leader of Baltimore, Maryland, urged gang members to stop shooting each other, saying hospital beds are needed to treat coronavirus patients. Following a spate of shootings on Tuesday night, Mayor Jack Young said: ""We cannot clog up our hospitals and their beds with people that are being shot senselessly because we're going to need those beds for people infected with the coronavirus. ""And it could be your mother, your grandmother or one of your relatives. So take that into consideration."" Meanwhile, as the US shortage of face masks becomes severe, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said nurses can ""use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with Covid-19"". The CDC, one of the world's leading public health institutes, said this should only be done ""as a last resort"" and conceded it was ""unknown"" if this would actually protect health workers from the virus. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which handles deportations of foreign nationals, said on Wednesday it would postpone most arrests during the coronavirus crisis. The Department of Homeland Security agency said it would also suspend enforcement operations at or near healthcare facilities. As of Tuesday, there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the 37,000 detainees in ICE detention facilities.","Describing himself as a ""wartime president"", President Donald Trump has vowed the US will achieve ""total victory"" over the coronavirus."
"He condemned the Church's ""complicity"" in hiding the abuse and said it must ""weep and make reparation"" for the ""grave crimes"" committed by clerics. He met the six victims, two each from Ireland, Britain and Germany, after a private morning Mass in the Vatican. The Church has been criticised after a series of abuse scandals worldwide. At a press conference on Monday, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Pope Francis had spent half an hour with each of the victims who visited him. He said the Pope had also greeted the group at a dinner on Sunday evening. 'Sacrilegious cult' The Pope said the abuses had been ""camouflaged with a complicity that cannot be explained"". He apologised to victims for the ""sins and grave crimes of clerical sexual abuse"", which he described as ""a sacrilegious cult"" that insulted God. He added: ""I beg your forgiveness, too, for the sins of omission on the part of Church leaders who did not respond adequately [to reports of sex abuse]."" None of the six victims made public statements after their discussions with the Pope, the BBC's Alan Johnston in Rome reports. Analysis: David Willey, BBC News, Rome Pope Francis' heartfelt and humble apology on behalf of his church to six European victims of sexual abuse by Catholic clerics may go some way towards meeting criticism by victims' associations in many countries that he had failed to address adequately the scandal that predator priests have caused. As usual, Pope Francis found original words to express his deep feelings of shame and sorrow. ""Someone realised that Jesus was looking,"" he told the three men and three women invited to a private Mass in the Vatican guesthouse where he lives. The Pope then spent the entire morning talking individually with them about the ""life-long scars"" left by what he compared to a ""sacrilegious cult"". Victims of clerical sexual abuse in Pope Francis' native Argentina have complained that none were invited to this unprecedented meeting, to which there was no media access. Some victims' groups have criticised Pope Francis for having failed to meet their representatives sooner. The Pope's predecessor, Pope Benedict, met abuse victims several times on trips outside Italy. ""It seems as though this is more of a public relations event for the Vatican and for Pope Francis,"" said Barbara Blaine, a member of an abuse survivors' group. She said the Pope had not done enough to protect vulnerable children. Former envoy convicted Many survivors of abuse by priests are also angry at what they see as the Vatican's failure to punish senior officials who have been accused of covering up scandals. Pope Francis last year strengthened the Vatican's laws against child abuse. He has also set up a committee, whose members include a cardinal and an abuse victim, to draw up plans to tackle exploitation by priests. The committee is expected to announce on Monday that it will expand to include more members from the developing world, Reuters news agency reports. Last month, a Vatican tribunal convicted Josef Wesolowski, a former papal envoy to the Dominican Republic, of sex abuse and stripped him of the priesthood. Wesolowski is the highest-ranking Vatican official to have been investigated over abuse claims.","Pope Francis has begged forgiveness from the victims of sexual abuse by priests, at his first meeting with the victims since his election."
"Mr Trump announced a plan to target the abuse of opioids, which kill more than 140 Americans each day. The president has previously promised to declare a national emergency, which would have triggered federal funding to help states combat the drug scourge. The move instead redirects grant money to be used in dealing with the crisis. Mr Trump said on Thursday at the White House: ""More people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined. ""These overdoses are driven by a massive increase in addiction to prescription painkillers, heroin and other opioids."" He added: ""The United States is by far the largest consumer of these drugs using more opioid pills per person than any other country by far in the world."" Mr Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing his acting health secretary to declare a nationwide public health emergency and ordering all federal agencies to take measures to reduce the number of opioid deaths, according to senior White House officials. The order will also ease some regulations to allow states more latitude in how they use federal funds to tackle the problem. But the White House plans to fund the effort through the Public Health Emergency Fund, which reportedly only contains $57,000 (Â£43,000). The Trump administration will then work with Congress to approve additional funding in a year-end spending package, senior officials said. Other elements of the directive include: Proponents suggest Mr Trump's announcement is a critical step in raising awareness about the nationwide epidemic, while some critics argue the move does not go far enough. ""The lack of resources is concerning to us since the opioid epidemic presenting lots of challenges for states' budgets,"" Michael Fraser, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told Politico. ""My hope is people will realise with no new money the ball is going to be in Congress's court,"" he added. Senator Bernie Sanders later tweeted that while Mr Trump was ""right that the opioid crisis is a national emergency"", Friday's announcement was ""nothing more than an empty promise"". ""Millions depend on Medicaid [healthcare funding] for opioid treatment. Trump's solution is to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion. That is a disgrace,"" wrote the Vermont senator. Taking the first step Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington Addiction to painkillers and heroin has blighted so many communities across the US - both urban and rural. As I travelled the country reporting on last year's election, I remember the hairdresser in Arkansas whose ex-husband died from medicines he'd been given for his bad back, the family in New Hampshire who'd lost a teenage daughter to an overdose and heard stories of doctors who'd become hooked on the very pills they'd prescribed. President Trump has stopped short of declaring this crisis a national emergency, despite earlier indications he would. Instead his public health emergency is more of a short-term measure which doesn't allocate as much funding. Recovering addicts and charities I've talked to say more investment in round-the-clock rehab and treatment is what is needed to make a difference. But while today's announcement is welcome, many will now be looking to Congress to take more action and secure more money to deal with this crisis. Since 1999, the number of deaths involving opioids have quadrupled, reaching 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the Presidential Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, citing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC first declared opioids, a class of pain medications as well as some street drugs, to be an ""epidemic"" in 2011. Mr Trump first announced his intention to declare opioid abuse a ""national emergency"" in August. ""The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I'm saying officially right now: It is an emergency. It's a national emergency,"" he said at the time. Experts had urged Mr Trump to use his presidential power under the Stafford Act to declare a national emergency, which would have given states access to money from the federal Disaster Relief Fund. States would have had immediate access to funding, much like they would after a natural disaster. But senior officials told reporters that declaring that sort of emergency was not a good fit for an ongoing crisis. The announcement comes after Mr Trump's pick for drug czar withdrew his nomination following a report that he helped neuter government attempts to tackle the opioid crisis. Pennsylvania congressman Tom Marino pushed a bill that reportedly stripped a federal agency of the ability to freeze suspicious painkiller shipments. Health Secretary Tom Price also resigned last month after it was revealed he was using expensive private planes for official business. As a candidate, Mr Trump frequently pledged to tackle the drug crisis, and often campaigned in the hardest-hit states.

"By Mariko OiBBC News, Japan It brought down a minister and a politician, practically destroyed the careers of a popular celebrity and a news commentator and nearly broke up one of Japan's biggest boy bands. Founded in 1959, it is a tabloid and boasts Japan's largest annual circulation of nearly 700,000. It has held this top spot for more than a decade. ""To get the scoop, you need to want to get the scoop,"" said its editor Manabu Shintani, ""but Japanese media - newspapers, TV or radio - they are no longer actively looking for it because it's too risky"". 'Culture of fear' It is a worrying trend in a country which has fallen from 11th to 72nd ranking in the World Press Freedom Index in the last six years. On Tuesday UN rights expert David Kaye wrapped up a visit to Japan by warning of ""serious threats"" to the independence of the press and a culture of fear among Japanese journalists. Although Japan has always said freedom of the press is protected, his comments come amid wider concerns about the government's growing influence on mainstream media. Three of Japan's news presenters, NHK's Hiroko Kuniya, TV Asahi's Ichiro Furutachi and TBS's Shigetada Kishii, were replaced at the start of the financial year in April. Their contracts were not renewed. Some claim they were replaced because they asked tough questions and were critical of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration. There is no evidence to back this, but Mr Kaye's visit to Japan came in the wake of these controversies. In a recently published essay, Ms Kuniya said ""I feel that there is growing pressure to conform,"" adding that mass media is also complicit. The relationship between the chiefs of major TV stations and newspapers are closely scrutinised by the public, mostly online, with some observers asking if they are censoring themselves to please the authorities. Some accuse the media of ""colluding"" with the government, or being ""under its thumb"". Communications minister Sanae Takaichi recently said that the government could revoke a broadcaster's license if it repeatedly fails to show political impartiality in its coverage. The ministry denies this was a veiled attempt at censorship, but the fear is that journalists stick to what Shukan Bunshun's Mr Shintani calls ""safe news"", such as the government's official announcements. There is also a financial reality that many media organisations face. ""Getting a scoop takes time and costs money but not all of them become an actual article,"" Mr Shintani explained. For example, it took his magazine nearly a year to publish an article about the bribery allegations against the then Economy Minister Akira Amari who later resigned from his position. Mr Amari said he had received money which he wanted declared as a political donation - however, he said some of it had been mishandled by his staff. There is also a risk of being sued for defamation. The magazine has been taken to court numerous times and it was once ordered to pay 4.4 million yen ($38,760; Â£27,350). But that has not stopped its 40 journalists from breaking stories. The weekly's investigative skills have long been reputable despite the populist nature of some of its reports. Others have struck very much at the heart of Japan's political culture. Back in 1974, it was the monthly magazine Bungei Shunju which reported the bribery allegation of the then prime minister Kakuei Tanaka. It eventually led to his arrest in 1976 and Mr Tanaka was later found guilty for violations of foreign exchange control laws. Biggest scalps Their repeated scoops have raised speculation that the magazine hires a private detective which Mr Shintani flatly denies. ""We may pay 5,000 to 10,000 yen ($46-92; Â£32-64) depending on tips but not much more,"" he said. Shukan Bunshun has been winning the scoop battle this year but its rival Shukan Shincho also recently exposed an extramarital affair of Hirotada Ototake, known for publishing a popular book about being born without arms or legs, who had been rumoured to run for parliament. The story shocked readers, not only because he is a symbol for the disabled in Japan, but also because he has admitted to five affairs. Some of the so-called scoops have been dismissed as little more than tasteless gossip, but the fact remains the majority of recent exclusives have been broken by such magazines, not newspapers or broadcasters. So what explains the tabloids getting there first? The finger is often pointed at the journalist clubs which reporters for mainstream media must belong to. They give them access to government officials and press conferences but foreign media - including the BBC - and freelance journalists are not granted entry, leading to accusations that the authorities are trying to control the information that is reported. Weekly magazine journalists don't have access either so while they are handicapped in terms of access, they are also freer to write what they like. ""There are lots of debates about how the government is trying to influence media,"" said editor of Shukan Bunshun, Manabu Shintani. ""But instead of expressing our opinions about it, it is our job to stick to facts and reveal what politicians are up to."" So by mixing big scoops with lots of gossip and pictures of topless girls - similar to that of The Sun's Page 3 girls - the Japanese public gets a different viewpoint and sometimes the real story from a tabloid.","As a media organisation getting one scoop can be luck, getting two can be a coincidence, but Japan's weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun had six in the first three months of 2016."
"Clemons was taken to hospital about a week ago after suffering a stroke at his home in Singer Island, in the US state of Florida. Known as the Big Man for his 6ft 5in frame, Clemons was credited with shaping the early sound of The Boss. His solos powered Springsteen hits such as Born to Run and Jungleland. Springsteen spokeswoman Marilyn Laverty confirmed the death on Saturday. On his website, Springsteen said the loss of Clemons was ""immeasurable"" and that he and his bandmates were honoured to have stood beside him for nearly four decades. The statement said: ""Clarence lived a wonderful life. He carried within him a love of people that made them love him."" It added: ""He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage."" Canadian rocker Bryan Adams expressed his sadness via Twitter: ""RIP Clarence Clemons, one of the greatest rock sax players."" Outside The Stone Pony, the legendary Jersey shore rock club where Clemons, Springsteen and other E Street band mates started out, fans have been leaving tributes since Clemons' death was announced. The club will open its doors at noon on Sunday to let fans gather and reminisce. Clemons had suffered from poor health in recent years, including major spinal surgery in January 2010. At the 2009 Super Bowl, following double knee replacement surgery, he rose from a wheelchair to perform with Springsteen. In May this year Clemons, a former youth councillor, was well enough to perform with Lady Gaga on the finale of the television show American Idol. Football dreams Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Clemons began playing saxophone at the age of nine after receiving one unexpectedly from his father for Christmas. ""I wanted an electric train for Christmas, but he got me a saxophone. I flipped out,"" he told the Associated Press news agency in a 1989 interview. After his dreams of being a football player were dashed by a car accident, he turned to music. Clemons hit it off immediately with Springsteen, then a singer-songwriter from New Jersey, when they first met in 1971, and the saxophonist became an original member of the E Street Band. Their friendship survived Springsteen's decision to concentrate on solo projects following the success of his album Born in the USA. In a 2009 interview, Clemons described his deep bond with The Boss, saying: ""It's the most passion that you have without sex."" As well as TV and movie appearances over the years, Clemons performed with the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band, and Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band. He also recorded with legendary musical artists such as Aretha Franklin, Roy Orbison and Jackson Browne. And he jammed with former US President Bill Clinton at the 1993 inaugural ball. Clemons published a memoir, Big Man: Real Life and Tall Tales, in 2009. The saxophonist once described performing as his natural environment. The stage, said the Baptist minister's grandson, ""always feels like home - it's where I belong"".","Clarence Clemons, the saxophone player in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, has died, aged 69, a spokeswoman for the band has said."
"By Mark LowenBBC Turkey correspondent, Istanbul It was supposed to be the site of Istanbul's gleaming new development: a grandiose mix of apartments, malls and spas in the district of Fikirtepe. The promotional video from 2010 showed a symbol of Turkey's newfound wealth. The homes of at least 15,000 people were demolished to make way for it. Many paid deposits to buy into the project. But as financial problems hit, investors pulled out â and most of the planned buildings never materialised. All that's left is a gaping hole of bankrupt companies and broken promises. It is symptomatic of a wider economic slump that poses the gravest threat to Recep Tayyip Erdogan in his 16 years in power. Polls before this weekend's local elections suggest his governing AK Party could lose control of the capital, Ankara â and perhaps even Istanbul. 'I feel hatred towards him' Zeynep Duzgunoldu, aged 60, welled up with tears as she pointed to where her old home used to stand beside a fresh fig tree. ""People used to call it 'the house with the beautiful kitchen'"", she said, her voice cracking. ""Now my rucksack is my home. I'm ashamed to ask my children for money."" Firdevs Uluocak's house is on the edge of the failed construction site and was destabilised by the digging. There's one target for her anger: Turkey's builder-in-chief, President Erdogan. ""I feel hatred towards him"", she said. ""I always voted for him - but he's ruined his people."" Over the past 16 years, Mr Erdogan has championed construction as the engine of Turkey's growth. His so-called ""mega projects"" - from airports to bridges to tunnels - have transformed the country's infrastructure. And high-rise housing developments have changed city skylines, often to the horror of architects. Construction moguls close to the president have won state tenders through political support. The industry is mired in claims of corruption and cronyism. But with inflation now at 20% and the Turkish lira having plunged by around a third, the cost of importing raw materials and servicing foreign loans has soared - and construction companies are failing. Pana Yapi, the conglomerate running the Fikirtepe project, told the BBC ""the whole country is going through an economic crisis"", arguing that it too is a victim. Cranes suspended in mid-air and half-built skyscrapers that now dot Istanbul are a sign of that crisis. Turkey entered recession last year, shrinking 3% in the final quarter. Many fear there is worse to come. ""Turkey is heavily dependent on foreign-denominated debt and when that's harder to service, that's when you see the problems we're in"", said Can Selcuki, general manager at Istanbul Economics Research. ""We could be on the brink of a major crash. We need high sums of foreign cash"", he said, ""and the most likely address for that is the International Monetary Fund"". President Erdogan has argued vociferously against an IMF loan, which would come with stringent conditions. ""But the cost of not finding the capital,"" argued Mr Selcuki, ""might be increased bankruptcies and a downward spiral."" Could slump bring down Erdogan? The economic downturn has prompted the president to turn the argument towards other issues. He has shown the video of the New Zealand mosque attack in rallies to galvanise his conservative, pious voters, whom he needs to turn out. As a quick fix for the cost of food â which has soared by a third â the government has bought up vegetables from farmers. It sells them directly to consumers in public stalls, bypassing the middle-men who have inflated prices and whom the president labels ""food terrorists"". At one of these stalls in the Istanbul district of Aksaray, lines were long as people waited to buy tomatoes, aubergines and spinach at half the price of supermarkets. ""The queues aren't a sign of poverty but of opportunity,"" said shopper Omer Cakirca, lauding the project. ""Everywhere is like this. If there is something on sale, everyone will go there."" But Esref Korkmaz disagrees: ""I bought cucumbers and tomatoes today - but this is just an investment for the elections,"" he said. ""They won't remain after April. I voted for the AKP before but not again because the economic situation is bad. I'll hold my nose and back the opposition this time."" The economy propelled Recep Tayyip Erdogan to power. It could now be his undoing.","The crater is the size of a football pitch, dug 50m (165ft) deep into the earth. Mounds of rock line the surface. The only life here is the seagulls drinking from pools of stagnant water."
"Architect of the plans, Deputy Gavin St Pier, said cutting four sites to three offered a better financial and educational deal for the island. The plans will now be subject to a final vote on Tuesday when the education debate continues. Education Minister Robert Sillars told the chamber the plans were ""catastrophic"". Politicians voted in favour of the closure by 27 votes to 18 in a debate on Friday that went on into the early evening. It has not been decided which school would close if the plans go ahead and a timetable for closure has not been set.",Politicians have voted to cut the number of state secondary schools in Guernsey.
"In a TV interview, Mr Sarkozy denied committing any unlawful act. He said the ""grotesque"" case against him was designed to humiliate, and harm his reputation. It is alleged Mr Sarkozy sought insider information from a judge about an inquiry into illegal campaign funding. Mr Sarkozy was detained on Tuesday for questioning - the first time a former French head of state has been held in police custody. He is hoping to challenge again for the presidency in 2017 and the allegations are seen as a blow to his hopes of returning to office. 'Deeply shocked' The interview with the ex-president, which was recorded for TF1 television and Europe 1 radio, was broadcast on Wednesday evening. In it Mr Sarkozy said: ""The situation is sufficiently serious to tell the French people where we stand on the political exploitation of part of the legal system today. ""I say to all those who are listening or watching that I have never betrayed them and have never committed an act against the Republic's principles and the rule of law."" Mr Sarkozy said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the investigation, and he accused the Syndicat de la Magistrature trade union of seeking to destroy him. ""Everything is being done to give me a reputation that is not true,"" he said. Mr Sarkozy added: ""In our country, which is the country of human rights and the rule of law, there are things that are being organised. ""The French need to know what they are and, in conscience and freedom, judge what to make of it."" He also expressed his anger at the way he was summoned, saying there ""was an intention to humiliate"" him with the formal detention. Analysis: By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris This was a classic Sarkozy counter-offensive. Barely able to contain his anger, he launched a blistering attack on the forces that he said were trying to bring him down. The former president is convinced there is a vendetta against him being run by left-wing elements in the justice system. In particular he has in mind one of the two judges in charge of his case, Claire Thepaut. She is a member of a left-wing magistrates' trade union which was openly hostile to Mr Sarkozy when he was president. Less blatantly, but by implication, Mr Sarkozy also attacked the Socialist government for at the very least knowing of the ""campaign"" against him, in particular of phone-taps of conversations between himself and his lawyer. Over and again he repeated the phrase ""Is it normal?"" to describe his handling by the judges. He wanted the same treatment as any other French citizen, he said, but he was not getting it. Earlier, Prime Minister Manuel Valls insisted the investigation was being carried out independently of the Socialist government. Talking to French TV, he said ""no-one is above the law"" but added that it was important to remember ""there is the presumption of innocence"". Gaddafi claims Mr Sarkozy was released from custody around midnight (22:00 GMT Tuesday) after appearing in court in Paris. When a suspect is placed under formal investigation, they are then examined by a judge, who determines whether there is sufficient evidence for the suspect to be charged. The step often, but not always, leads to trial. Influence-peddling can be punished by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros (Â£120,000; $205,000). Investigators have been looking into allegations that Mr Sarkozy, 59, who was president from 2007 to 2012, promised a prestigious role in Monaco to senior prosecutor Gilbert Azibert in exchange for information about the investigation into illegal campaign funding. Mr Azibert was never given the job. The inquiry into funding is looking into whether Mr Sarkozy received illegal donations for the 2007 election campaign from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Mr Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and Mr Azibert have also been placed under formal investigation. Investigations into Nicolas Sarkozy July 2014: Placed under formal investigation on suspicion of peddling influence to obtain details from a magistrate about legal proceedings against him in 2013. October 2013: A criminal investigation into allegations he solicited secret campaign financing in 2007 from France's richest woman, Liliane Bettencourt, is dropped. April 2013: Judges open an inquiry into allegations that the Gaddafi regime helped finance his 2007 election campaign. Mr Sarkozy was also named as a witness in February 2014 in an investigation into funding for Edouard Balladur's unsuccessful presidential bid in 1995. A number of other inquiries are under way into wrongdoing by senior officials during his presidency, in which he has not figured directly.","Ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has said the French justice system is being used for ""political ends"" after he was placed under formal investigation for influence peddling."
"Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said sales tax would rise from 18% to 21%, and local authorities would have their budgets slashed. He is aiming to save 65bn euros (Â£51bn; $80bn) as part of a deal with eurozone leaders to help rescue Spain's banks. The move coincided with a miners' rally in Madrid, where police fired rubber bullets at crowds of protesters. Thousands of people joined in the rally to support the miners, who have been campaigning for weeks against major cuts to industry subsidies. Witnesses said protesters out to support the miners threw fireworks, bottles and stones at riot police. The officers fired rubber bullets and charged at the demonstrators. Five people were arrested and three people suffered minor injuries, according to the AFP news agency. 'Circumstances change' The prime minister, interrupted several times by opposition MPs, told parliament that the changes he was announcing had to be adopted without delay. Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to provide 30bn euros (Â£24bn) for Spain's troubled banks by the end of the month and to give Madrid an extra year - until 2014 - to hit its budget targets. Mr Rajoy acknowledged that the VAT rise contradicted a campaign pledge made before his Popular Party came to power. As recently as January he said there was no plan to raise the tax. ""I said I would lower taxes and I am actually raising them. Circumstances change and I have to adapt to them."" The package of measures would cut the budget by 65bn euros over two-and-a-half years, he said. ""The excesses of the past are being paid for right now,"" he said, adding that Spaniards had never before experienced such a recession. Without a cut in Spain's budget deficit, public services would be put at risk, he said. Savings of 3.5bn euros will be made to government administration budgets, with local authorities banned from offering services they cannot afford and the number of councillors reduced by 30% in some areas. The door had been opened to a new EU model, Mr Rajoy said, and the summit agreements had committed everyone equally. Spain's unemployment is running at more than 24% and analysts say European leaders want to see a credible Spanish plan for viability and deficit reduction. ""What animates us is the five million people out of work,"" Mr Rajoy told parliament. The European Commission praised the Spanish government's ""determination"" and swift action. ""It's an important step to ensure that the fiscal targets for this year can be met,"" spokesman Simon O'Connor told reporters. Mass rally Thousands of miners marched through the centre of Madrid towards the industry ministry to protest against plans to slash coal industry subsidies from 301m euros last year to 111m euros this year. ""It's just cuts and more cuts,"" David Menendez, a miner from Asturias, told the Associated Press news agency. He and his colleagues had been further angered by the latest round of tax increases and spending cuts. Many of the workers had walked hundreds of miles since 22 June from northern Spain, where demonstrations outside coal mines have resulted in clashes with police. Unions say the cuts threaten 30,000 jobs and could destroy their industry. The Spanish government argues that it pays disproportionately high subsidies to a small and unprofitable part of the economy. Spain's 30bn-euro bank bailout will be the first instalment of a package worth up to 100bn euros agreed in June. Eurozone ministers must get approval from their own parliaments and hope to make the payment by the end of July.","Spain's government has announced sweeping new austerity measures, amid clashes between protesters and police."
"By Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter The field of candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination has been shrinking for months, but on Wednesday night in Nevada, the debate stage had one significant new arrival. For the first time since he launched his unconventional, money-suffused campaign in November, the former New York mayor directly faced off against his opponents. And they nearly took his face off, rhetorically speaking. Here's how the two-hour fight for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in November's election went down. Everyone v Bloomberg Right out of the starting gate, candidate after candidate took turns taking shots at the newcomer to the contest. It was the political equivalent of an incredibly lopsided tag-team wrestling match. Bernie Sanders wasted no time highlighting the mayor's support of a stop-and-frisk New York City police policy that was heavily criticised by civil rights activists. Elizabeth Warren brought up derogatory comments Bloomberg is reported to have made about women and the private agreements he has made to settle sexual harassment and hostile workplace lawsuits. ""Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,"" she said, in an attempt to tie Bloomberg to Donald Trump. Amy Klobuchar accused him of hiding behind his TV adverts, while Joe Biden highlighted his past criticism of Barack Obama's healthcare reform. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg used one answer to go after both Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders, who it should not be forgotten is leading the national polls at the moment. He warned that if Sanders and Bloomberg are the only candidates left standing after the next few rounds of voting, Democrats will be left with two polarising figures - ""a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks money is the root of all power"". ""We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out,"" he added. How did Bloomberg defend himself? All of Bloomberg's opponents had their attack lines rehearsed and ready to launch, and Bloomberg at times appeared to struggle to keep up. He apologised for his stop-and-frisk policy, saying that he didn't realise how harmful it was to his city's black community. He stood by his decision not to drop the nondisclosure agreements that keep details of the lawsuits against his companies private, adding ""None of them have accused me of doing anything wrong, except maybe they didn't like the joke I told."" That solicited groans from the audience. It's been more than 10 years since Bloomberg has participated in any kind of political debate. On Wednesday night, he cannon-balled into the deep end of a pool where the rest of the field has been doing laps for months. He was a stroke slower; he was aloof; he was seemingly ill-prepared for the onslaught. If he thought operating in the rough-and-tumble world of New York City politics would prepare him for a presidential campaign melee, he was mistaken. His highly paid, well-staffed campaign team have a lot of work to do in the days ahead. Everyone v Sanders The Sanders campaign team may insist that the man who has made a career of being a political outsider should never be considered a front-runner for the presidential nomination. But what else do you call someone who leads the national polls, has the best fundraising numbers and boasts a vast, experienced campaign organisation? And Sanders learned on Wednesday that when you're leading the pack, everyone can see the target on your back. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, took the opportunity to slam the Vermont senator on the hostility his supporters sometimes show on social media - and what Buttigieg said was his campaign's tolerance of them. ""I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign in particular that seems to be motivating this behaviour more than others,"" he said. The sharpest swipes, not surprisingly came from Bloomberg - who was perhaps relieved he could regain his footing and go on the attack. Early on, he said that there was ""no chance"" Sanders could beat Donald Trump. He followed it up by suggesting Sanders' political theories had been consigned to history's dustbin. ""We're not going to throw out capitalism,"" he said to Sanders. ""We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work."" Sanders told Bloomberg that was a ""cheap shot,"" adding that his democratic socialism is not communism. Even Warren, who usually pulls her punches against her fellow progressive, had a few sharp lines on Sanders' healthcare plan. Past front-runners have seen their fortunes fall eventually, as the attacks gained ferocity. Sanders benefits from being at the top at the right time - as the primary voting is underway. If he wants to stay on top, he's going to have to earn it. Everyone v Everyone With the primaries in full swing, it is desperate times for many of the candidates. The debate was two-hour proof of just how tense things are getting. Warren is normally a placid debater, but facing sagging poll numbers and a poor result in New Hampshire, she went on the attack against pretty much everyone, positioning herself as a compromise between the moderates and Sanders. ""Look, Democrats want to beat Donald Trump but they are worried,"" she said. ""They are worried about gambling on a narrow vision that doesn't address the fears of millions of Americans across this country who see real problems and want real change. They are worried about gambling on a revolution that won't bring along a majority of this country."" Warren's performance may leave her supporters wondering what might have been if she had showed this kind of fire before New Hampshire - and how much they'd love to see this Warren face off against Donald Trump. Speaking of the moderates, one of the most vicious series of exchanges was between Klobuchar and Buttigieg. She accused him of mocking her intelligence. He said she was belittling his mayoral experience. ""I wish I were as perfect as you, Pete,"" Klobuchar said with barely concealed contempt. The two did not shake hands when it was all over. In the end, the debate may leave the field as muddled as it was going in. Given his relative strength, Sanders will probably leave Las Vegas with his momentum intact. Bloomberg, the real wildcard, may find some of his newfound supporters wondering how to reconcile his slick appearance in his ever-present commercials with the sometimes halting, tin-eared man on stage. Biden and Warren both showed some fire they hope will rekindle their campaigns before it's too late, while Klobuchar and Buttigieg might be satisfied seeing the other consumed by flames. In six days, they'll get to do it all again in Charleston, South Carolina. At this rate, security might want to screen the participants for hidden weapons.

"US immigration officials confirmed the Romeike family have been granted ""prosecutorial discretion"". In Germany, parents who refuse to send their children to state-approved schools face fines, imprisonment and the removal of the children. The family sought asylum in the US, saying they feared persecution at home. 'Very appreciative' Immigration officials rejected their bid and on Monday, the US Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal in the case. But on Tuesday, the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), which was representing the Romeikes, said the family of nine had been granted ""indefinite deferred action"" status, lawyer Michael Donnelly told the BBC. ""We are just very appreciative,"" Mr Donnelly said. ""We think this was the right decision."" ""US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) exercises discretion on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,"" agency spokesman Bryan Cox told the BBC in a statement. ""After conducting a comprehensive review of the Romeike family's case, ICE has chosen to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this matter."" In 2008, Uwe and Hanalore Romeike left the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg for the US state of Tennessee, fearing they would be sent to jail or lose custody of their seven children if they continued to home-school them. Uwe, the father, applied for asylum in the US, arguing his family faced persecution in Germany, where almost all children are required to attend schools approved by the German government. A Tennessee judge initially granted the asylum request, but an appeals court overturned that ruling. A hearing at the US Supreme Court was the Romeikes' last hope for legal asylum. The family, who profess to be evangelical Christians, have won the support of many in the well-organised US Christian home-school community. An online petition asking the government to grant the family asylum was signed by more than 127,000 people. Decision could be revoked Some US legal analysts say it is no surprise the asylum request was denied. ""Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort,"" Professor David Abraham, an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law, told the BBC in November. ""What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted."" Following Tuesday's decision, Mr Abraham added that US immigration officials were focusing their attention on deporting criminals. ""Getting this family out of the United States is not a high priority,"" he said. Mr Donnelly said that while the deferred status enabling the Romeikes to remain in the US could be revoked, the family has no reason to believe they will be deported for at least the remainder of the Obama administration. President Barack Obama leaves office in January 2017. ""As long as we can live at peace here we are happy,"" Mr Romeike said in a statement provided to the Associated Press news agency.

"Evidence from the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) showed Andreas Lubitz had repeatedly changed the setting of the altitude controls during the plane's flight from Duesseldorf to Barcelona earlier, but as the plane was on autopilot its planned descent was not affected. Later the same day Lubitz was alone in the cockpit during the flight from Barcelona back to Duesseldorf when he initiated the plane's dive. He refused to allow the captain back through the cockpit door or respond to air traffic control. Speculation over the reasons for his actions has centred around the co-pilot's mental wellbeing. The German A320 Airbus flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf came down in a remote mountain valley in France on Tuesday 24 March, killing all 150 people on board. Debris in Alps crash zone What happened? The plane took off from Barcelona at 09:01 GMT on 24 March. Reports from Flightradar24, which tracks air traffic around the world, said the Airbus climbed to 38,000ft within the next half hour. At 09:30 the plane made its final contact with air traffic control - a routine message for permission to continue on its route. One minute later it began to descend. The descent lasted nearly 10 minutes before last radar contact with the Airbus at 09.40:47. The Airbus crashed in a remote, snow-covered mountainous region - some parts reaching about 1,500m (4,900ft) high - that is inaccessible by road. On 26 March, French investigators said information from the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) - found at the crash zone revealed that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had taken over the controls of the plane and sent it into a dive intentionally. The captain, named by German media as Patrick Sonderheimer, had left to go to the toilet, leaving Mr Lubitz in sole control. At this point, the co-pilot activated the plane's descent. It was Mr Lubitz's ""intention to destroy this plane,"" Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said. The cockpit voice recorder, discovered at the crash site, has given investigators details of the last 30 minutes of the flight. For the first 20 minutes, the two pilots talked normally, prosecutors said, then the captain is heard asking the co-pilot to take over. The sound of a chair being pushed back can be heard followed by a door being closed. Then, during the final minutes of the flight's descent, pounding can be heard on the door and muffled voices as the captain tried desperately to get back into the cockpit. Alarms also sounded, warning the pilots to ""pull up"". The Marseille air traffic control centre and the French Air Defence system both attempted to contact the flight crew several times. While the co-pilot did not say a word after the commanding pilot left, his breathing could be detected, indicating he was still alive at the time of the impact, Mr Robin said. At 09:41:06 the CVR ceased recording when the plane hit the ground. There has been speculation that the co-pilot's actions were a result of mental health problems. Investigators found anti-depressants at his house along with evidence of treatment by various doctors, including a torn-up sick note for the day he flew the plane. There have also been a number of newspaper reports he had faced problems with his eyesight - possibly a detached retina - which could have affected his ability to carry on working as a pilot. The interim report by French accident investigation agency BEA confirmed Lubitz had been treated for depression in April 2009 and subsequently his pilot's licence was issued on condition he undertook certain regular medical checks. More: How are cockpit doors locked? 'Black boxes' The plane's CVR - one of its two ""black boxes"" - was retrieved from the crash zone, although in battered condition. The second box, recording technical data, was recovered a few days later. It was also severely damaged - but did reveal information about the previous flight from Duesseldorf to Barcelona. An aircraft's flight recorders are often the key to establishing what caused a plane to crash. Each plane carries two recorders: the CVR and the flight data recorder (FDR). Although they are popularly known as black box recorders, they are, in fact, orange to aid in recovery. The CVR, as the name suggests, records the voices of the pilots and other sounds from the cockpit. It retains two hours of recording - on longer flights, the latest data is recorded over the oldest. On some older models, magnetic tape is still used for the recording, but newer models use memory chips. The FDR records technical flight data, including at least five basic sets of information: pressure altitude, airspeed, heading, acceleration and microphone keying (the time radio transmissions were made by the crew). The FDR retains the last 25 hours of aircraft operations and, like the CVR, data is recorded on an endless loop. Both recorders are designed to withstand a massive impact and a fire reaching temperatures up to 1,100C for 60 minutes. The interim report by BEA, released on 6 May 2015, published a chart using data from the FDR, showing how Lubitz altered the altitude setting to the minimum 100ft several times, when the captain left the cabin. But each time he changed it back to the correct level after just a few seconds. Because the plane was on autopilot on a planned descent to Barcelona, its actual course was not altered. ""I can't speculate on what was happening inside his head - all I can say is that he changed this button to the minimum setting of 100ft and he did it several times,"" BEA director Remy Jouty told Reuters news agency. Debris field Debris from the aircraft was spread across an area of about four hectares (10 acres), about 1,550m up the mountainside in a sloping rocky ravine. The largest pieces of wreckage were 3-4m long. Parts of the plane's wings and fuselage were found towards the bottom of the ravine, where tree trunks had been uprooted and the ground was churned up. The aircraft The plane is one of the oldest A320s in operation. It entered service for the German airline in 1991. It had passed a routine maintenance check only the day before the flight. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 27, joined Germanwings in September 2013, directly after training, and had flown 630 hours. Lufthansa said the captain had more than 6,000 hours of flying experience and had been with Germanwings since May 2014, having flown previously for Lufthansa and Condor. Lufthansa said its cockpit protocols are in line with rules established by the German aviation safety authority. These stipulate that when there are two crew, one can leave the cockpit but only for the absolute minimum time. EASA - the European Aviation Safety Agency - has since issued new guidelines requiring two authorised staff to remain in the cockpit at all times. Who was on on board? There were 144 passengers on board the plane, four cabin crew and two more crew in the cockpit. Germanwings officials said victims included 72 German nationals, among them 16 school students. The Spanish authorities say there were 51 Spaniards. Other victims were from Australia, Argentina, Britain, Iran, Venezuela, the US, the Netherlands, Colombia, Mexico, Japan, Denmark and Israel.","The co-pilot of a Germanwings flight that crashed into the French Alps may have practised a rapid descent only hours before he sent the plane plunging into the mountainside ""intentionally"", according to French investigators."
"If you are looking to plan a bird-watching holiday, Sierra Leone might not be the first destination that jumps to mind. But that could change soon, if the government of this small West African nation gets its way. Earlier this month, Sierra Leone opened the Gola Rainforest National Park, a 71,000-hectare protected area that is home to more bird species than can be found breeding in all of the UK. The government hopes that the new park might help nature-loving tourists see beyond the battered image that defines the country overseas. The reason for that image is a brutal 11-year civil war which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. But Sierra Leone has been at peace since the conflict ended in 2002. ""The great news is that despite the area being one of the worst hit during the war, the biodiversity survived relatively intact,"" said Jonathan Barnard, the head of the tropical forest unit at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which has been doing conservation work in the Gola region since 1989. The park is Sierra Leone's largest remaining piece of the Upper Guinea Forest Ecosystem, a region that the environmental group Conservation International has identified as one of the world's critical biodiversity hotspots. The new national park is home to over 500 butterfly species, 300 bird species and 45 species of mammals. More than two dozen of those animals are under threat globally, including the pygmy hippo, the Diana monkey, the chimpanzee and the white-necked picathartes - a charismatic bird that the government has picked as the park's official symbol. 'Rich flora and fauna' The government hopes that such species will lure wildlife enthusiasts from overseas. The national park ""is already receiving a modest number of adventurous tourists"", Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma said at the official opening of the park. ""With further development, ecotourism will continue to grow and generate economic benefits for the country."" A few walking trails have been set up inside the national park, and more are on the way. Soon tourists may be able to take canoe rides down the Mano River and go on guided nature walks to spot nesting birds. But tourism-wise, there is still a long way to go. The national park, in the Eastern Province along the border with Liberia, has only a couple of very basic lodges for visitors, and it takes six hours of driving - the last two on very rough roads - to reach the park from the capital, Freetown. Not even 100 tourists visited the Gola Rainforest in the last year. Few people outside the country have even heard of it. Cecil Williams, the general manager of Sierra Leone's National Tourist Board, called Gola Forest an ""ideal attraction"" given its rich flora and fauna. ""The difficulty I see is accessibility,"" Mr Williams said. ""But in the next five to 10 years' time, all of these infrastructure problems will have improved."" A more stubborn obstacle might be the country's international reputation. Many in the West still see Sierra Leone as a war-zone filled with blood diamonds and child soldiers, an image that seems to have been cemented by the 2006 film Blood Diamond, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio. 'Quality tourism' That negative image ""isn't as strong as it was five or six years ago,"" said Bimbola Carroll, who runs the Freetown-based tour company Visit Sierra Leone. ""It's gradually getting better, but it's still thereâ¦ Bad news stays in your head a bit longer."" The country attracted just 7,700 leisure visitors in 2010, according to data from the National Tourist Board. That figure is expected to reach 10,000 this year. But that still leaves Sierra Leone far behind countries like nearby Senegal, which welcomed nearly 1 million tourists in 2008. The government is betting that ecotourism could be the way to boost Sierra Leone's tourist numbers. In 2012, the Tourist Board will dole out grants to improve the facilities at five ecotourism destinations around the country, including River Number Two Beach, which is where the famous ""Taste of Paradise"" Bounty Bar advert was filmed. At this early stage, the aim is to attract a modest number of tourists who will make multiple visits and who will recommend the country to their friends back home, Mr Williams said. ""We would rather go for quality tourism than quantity tourism.""","Sierra Leone is trying to change its image as a war-torn country by promoting ecotourism, writes journalist Paige McClanahan at the launch of the new Gola Rainforest National Park."
"By Gemma HandySt John's, Antigua Almost devoid of vegetation, this tiny remnant of a prehistoric volcano looks like a hulk of nothingness. This is Antigua and Barbuda's third island, the one you will not find in tourist brochures. It could not be further from the lush landscapes fringed by white-sand beaches that helped put its sisters on the map. Redonda, stretching just one mile (1.6km) long, is entirely uninhabited save for a handful of conservationists, who are currently camping here. And some perplexed-looking goats which, until February, had the island to themselves for decades. It may seem uninspiring at first glance but environmentalists hope to transform its barren terrain into a fertile eco-haven. Its desolate appearance belies its status as prized seabird habitat, home to rare and unique wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. Yet these reptiles, tropical birds, frigates and boobies have been in danger of disappearing thanks to two invasive species introduced by early colonists. The long-horned goats, brought here 300 years ago, have eaten almost all the plants that once carpeted Redonda. Now with barely anything left for them to feed on, many have starved to death, their carcasses littering the land. Conservationists hope that by re-homing the 75-strong herd on to the main island of Antigua, around 30 miles (50km) away, Redonda will be able to flourish once again. Several have already been flown out by helicopter. To keep them calm on the 20-minute flight, shower caps or hoods made from yoga pants are put on their heads. Protective material, which actually comes from swimming floats known as noodles, is wrapped around their horns so they do not injure each other. Today, half a dozen more are in a corral awaiting embarkation to the mainland. The government's department of agriculture plans to breed them for their useful, drought-adapted genes. Also in conservationists' targets are thousands of black rats, which they plan to eradicate. The rodents arrived with a 19th-Century guano-mining community and have come to prey on wildlife, eating precious birds' eggs. For the handful of international non-governmental organisations at work here, in conjunction with the Antiguan government and the country's Environmental Awareness Group, Redonda is something of a giant outdoor laboratory. ""We will be watching to see what grows when all the goats and rats are gone,"" Elizabeth Bell, of Wildlife Management International Ltd, tells the BBC. ""In Columbus's day, Redonda would have been completely covered with ficus trees. In five to 10 years, I think we will see reasonably interesting changes. Within 100, there will be massive change."" She said her ideal scenario would be to see it ""fully forested again, with a larger population of boobies and frigate birds, lizards everywhere, and a massive increase in ground birds"". The island is also home to an endemic pygmy gecko, a species that was only discovered in 2012. The team eventually hopes to reintroduce long-departed iguanas and burrowing owls too. Under international conservation protocol, it takes two years before the island can be declared a rat-free zone. The painstaking eradication project involves laying rat bait, flavoured with everything from liquorice to chocolate, in every crevice. The spots hardest to reach are accessed by abseiling and snorkelling. Redonda's dramatic deforestation has also triggered soil erosion and landslides threatening nearby coral reefs, says Shanna Challenger, a coordinator of the $700,000 (Â£540,000), three-year programme. Salina Janzan, from Surrey in the UK, is one of several environmentalists camping out among the relics of stone buildings left over from the guano miners. She said she had accepted the challenge to come as part of a delegation from the Fauna & Flora International (FFI) charity, partly because she had read a children's book called The Dragon of Redonda about the island when she was young. ""What do I miss most?"" she says, with a grin. ""A cold drink. In fact, anything cold. And proper showers. This is the longest anyone has lived on Redonda in decades."" Eccentric though it may sound, this is not the first time a project of this kind has been undertaken. FFI says it has already eliminated black rats from 23 Caribbean islands since 1995, including 15 of Antigua & Barbuda's offshore isles. The work is believed to have saved the Antiguan racer, once the world's rarest known snake, from imminent extinction. ""Redonda is a pretty incredible place, both for the human history and the natural history,"" Ms Bell adds. ""To be working to make it even more special is magical.""","As the tiny, rugged isle of Redonda appears like an eerie moonscape through the rain clouds, it is easy to see why people refer to it simply as ""the rock""."
"But fires do not stop at borders, and Bolivia's forest is burning too. The Amazon sprawls for millions of square miles across nine different countries - and Bolivia has seen fires rage across the forest near its borders with Brazil and Paraguay. The size of the fires is estimated to have doubled since Thursday. About one million hectares - or more than 3,800 square miles- are affected. Yet while Brazil's President Bolsonaro has been trading rhetorical blows with world leaders over his actions to protect the rainforest, little attention has been given to the blaze in Bolivia and its causes. Bolivian President Evo Morales is in the midst of a controversial re-election campaign, having gone to the courts to abolish term limits as he seeks a fourth time as the country's leader. Unlike his Brazilian counterpart, he has decided to accept international help in fighting the fires - securing a Boeing 747 ""supertanker"" from the US to drop water, and welcoming the offer of aid from the G7 summit at the weekend. Tweeting messages of solidarity and unity, Mr Morales said nothing was more important than Mother Earth - ""she can live without us, but we can't live without her"", and has suspended his election campaign for a week. But critics say this focus on environmentalism is a sudden U-turn, at odds with his record. Under Mr Morales, polices have been changed to allow farmers to clear more land than before by controlled burns - quadrupling the allowance from five to 20 hectares. The decree was only issued last month. Jhanisse Daza, an environmental activist who lives near the area, said she believes the fires may be deliberate policy. ""You have to understand that the use of controlled fires in August when we are going through a dry season is not only negligence,"" she said. ""I believe they knew what they were doing."" ""So there's a policy by the Morales government â although it shows itself internationally as being incredibly environmental and supportive of environmental rights but their policy has been going the complete opposite direction."" Similar accusations are levelled in Brazil, where most of the fires are believed to have been set deliberately by farmers and other small groups who believe they will not face consequences under Bolsonaro's government. Aside from Mr Morales' pro-agriculture razing policy, his government has also been accused of being slow to react when the fires first broke out, and said it would fight the fires itself without the need for foreign aid. Predictably, Evo Morales' rival for the presidency, Carlos Mesa, said the president's efforts had come too late. ""The government reacted late and poorly, it took them almost two weeks and they were without a strategic plan. Evo Morales has put his campaign first rather than governing Bolivia,"" he said. The refusal to accept foreign aid has now been reversed. Reuters news agency reported that the about-face came after provincial officials and village leaders pleaded with the government to accept the aid. Indigenous leaders have also voiced their criticism. Alex Villca, an indigenous leader in the Amazon region and spokesman for the indigenous rights group Contiocap said that the government was to blame for the fires. ""We need to hold Evo Morales to account for this situation. When is he going to account for all of this? He needs to be held accountable for all the times that the rights of the indigenous people have been violated, as well as those of mother nature,"" he said. Progress is now being made, as some 2,000 firefighters and the military tackle the outbreaks - but much damage has already been done.","All eyes have been on the burning of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, as international pressure - and sharp criticism - have been heaped upon its president."

"By Jessica LussenhopBBC News There is still much to learn about what led 29-year-old Omar Mateen to murder 49 patrons at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. On Sunday, police said 50 people had been killed. However, on Monday, they changed that figure to 49, to exclude the gunman from the death toll. President Barack Obama did not hesitate to condemn the massacre as ""an act of terror and an act of hate"". ""This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends - our fellow Americans - who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,"" he said in an address to the nation. ""The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live."" The Orlando attack is a painful reminder that even though the US has made historic strides in broadening the rights of its LGBT citizens - like the legalisation of gay marriage in June 2015 - the struggle up until this point has been a difficult and sometimes violent one. Seattle's openly gay mayor Ed Murray says the struggle for equal rights has usually seen moments of progress followed by a violent reaction. ""Americans woke with the sickening, all-too-familiar feeling of fear that our community has once again been attacked. For too long, our community has been the target of violence throughout the world,"" he said. Nicholas Syrett, co-chair of the Committee on LGBT History and a professor at the University of Northern Colorado, said more openness came with a cost: ""Those who still remain intransigent in their hostility and opposition to gay people, they're going to be exposed to more of them because we are increasingly able to be open."" Until the shooting in Orlando, the largest mass death at a gay club was the arson attack at the UpStairs Lounge in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1973. Thirty-two people died after an unknown assailant firebombed the entrance to the second-floor club, trapping people inside. Like many of the patrons at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, the revellers at the UpStairs Lounge were celebrating Pride Weekend. In more recent history, in 2014, a Seattle man set fire to a stairwell at a gay bar called Neighbours, claiming ""what these people are doing is wrong"". No-one was killed. In 1997, Eric Rudolph bombed a lesbian bar in Atlanta, injuring five. Mr Syrett said that while large-scale attacks on the LGBT community were not as common, there had been hundreds of individual assaults and murders, including the high-profile beating death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998. Similar attacks have taken place internationally as well - in 1999, a nail bomb killed three people and injured dozens more at the Admiral Duncan pub, in the heart of London's gay community. The culprit was a right-wing extremist. There have also been documented executions of gay people in territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State (IS). Those accused of being LGBT are thrown from the roofs of buildings or stoned to death. ""Isis [another name for IS] are also professional when it comes to tracking gay people. They hunt them down one by one,"" wrote one man who fled IS in Iraq in an essay for BBC News. ""They are trying to track down every gay man. And it's like dominoes. If one goes, the others will be taken down too."" In Orlando, Mateen was said to have called the emergency number 911 to pledge his allegiance to IS just before launching his attack. Mark Wallace, CEO of the Counter Extremism Project, said it was difficult to know how many LGBT men and women had been killed by IS, but the practice was well documented. ""The targeting, persecution and killing of LGBT [people] in Isis-controlled territory is extensive. ""LGBT people have been suffering at the hands of extremists in various cultures and parts of the world for some time."" Though Mr Wallace said he did not want to diminish the suffering of the gay community, he added that the attacks in Orlando were about much more than an opposition to homosexuality. ""Isis and extremist ideology hate all of us,"" he says. ""It's really an attack on all of us. It's an attack on the way we live - our openness.""","The worst mass shooting in modern American history was also a hate crime against the gay community. It's not the first time LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people have been the targets of violence."
"Benjamin Long, 18, pleaded guilty to driving the vehicle off-road on Slieau Freoaghane on the Isle of Man in June. A walker found and photographed the car near the top of the hill.

"They say that the ban is aimed solely at preventing him from campaigning ahead of elections promised next year. But the government argues that travel restrictions are standard ahead of several court cases Mr Nasheed faces. Mr Nasheed resigned as president in February in what he said was a coup. Succeeded by his deputy, Mohamed Waheed, he said he was forced to quit by threats of violence from rebellious police and soldiers. But a domestic commission of inquiry - backed by the Commonwealth - last month rejected his account, saying he had stepped down voluntarily. 'Abuse of power' In a hearing on Tuesday, the court in Male imposed the travel restrictions, forcing Mr Nasheed to seek court permission if he wants to leave the capital. Male is located on one small island, which means that it will be impossible for the former president to travel around the coral atoll nation and campaign in the elections, his party says. While president in January, Mr Nasheed is accused of illegally ordering the arrest of a judge accused of corruption. The move triggered weeks of protests, culminating in him being replaced as leader on 7 February. The abuse of power case is due to come to court on Monday. Reports say that Mr Nasheed could face up to three years in jail or banishment to a remote island if found guilty. In addition the former president faces two civil law suits for allegedly defaming Police Commissioner Abdullah Riyaz and Defence Minister Mohamed Nazim. Those cases are due to be heard on 28 September and 2 October. ""The regime fears Nasheed will win an election. So they plan to convict him of something so they can prevent him from standing. They know their grip on power is dependent on removing Nasheed from the political equation,"" Mr Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) said in a statement. MDP spokesman Hamid Abdul Gafoor told the BBC the government was trying to dismantle the party and was planning to put Mr Nasheed under house arrest or in prison, inspired by Burma's past actions. But a spokesman for President Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik rejected the allegation, saying the court order was ""the usual practice, according to the country's law"". ""It's done to everyone and nothing extraordinary has been done to him. It's totally a judicial matter and the government has no influence on the judiciary,"" the spokesman said.","Supporters of former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed say that a court order preventing him from leaving the capital, Male, is unfair and politically motivated."
"The organisers Pink Life QueerFest Four had planned to screen four films at cinemas on 16 and 17 November. They said the decision ""deprives us of our constitutional rights"". Homosexuality is not illegal in Turkey but activists say homophobia remains widespread. In a statement, Ankara's governor office said the festival's content ""could incite grudges and enmity toward a part of society"". Intelligence suggested that ""terror organizations are seeking to attack dissident groups or individuals"" and that the ""screening could be provocative and draw reactions"", it added. The event's organisers said the festival had already been attacked on social media before it was banned. ""Suggesting that these screenings could be provocative or targeted by terror groups only goes to legitimise those people and institutions that produce hate speech toward us and see our existence as a threat,"" they said in a statement.

The cancellation comes amid deteriorating relations between the two countries sparked by the detention of German nationals and what Turkey says it is Germany's interference in domestic issues. LGBT groups have complained that their rights are being curtailed under the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP), which is rooted in conservative Islam.

"The child, known only as Carla, identifies as a girl but has no female reproductive organs, Family Court documents show. The court approved a request by Carla's parents to surgically remove male gonads inside her body. People with a combination of sex characteristics are called intersex. 'Stereotypically female' behaviour When Carla turned five, her parents wanted to clarify if they needed court permission for the complex and irreversible surgery. The Family Court heard Carla was born with female-appearing genitalia and exhibited ""stereotypically female"" behaviour, which included never wanting to be referred to as a male and a preference for ""female toys, clothes and activities"". Court documents seen by the BBC show medical experts testified that surgery would remove the risk of Carla developing tumours and that she had no certainty of future fertility. The surgery should happen before puberty, they said. What is intersex? If you are born with a mix of male and female sexual characteristics, this means you have a disorder or difference of sex development (DSD), also known as being intersex. There are numerous different conditions which come under this umbrella term. Taken together, they are more common than you might think - experts say perhaps one in 2,000 babies are born with some kind of sex development difference. These conditions occur when the reproductive organs and genitals do not develop as expected. As a result, you might have female sex chromosomes but your reproductive organs and genitals are male - or the opposite way round. Or you may have a mixture of male and female organs and genitals, or some that are neither clearly male nor female. This occurs because of how your particular genes respond to the sex hormones in your body. DSDs can be treated with hormone therapy, psychological support and - sometimes - surgery. 'At 12 I grew a beard and had a period' The court ruled the parents did not need permission to arrange surgery. The ruling was made in January but it was not immediately made available to the public, The Australian newspaper said. ""I consider the proposed medical treatment 'therapeutic' as being necessary to appropriately and proportionately treat a genetic bodily malfunction that, untreated, poses real and not insubstantial risks to the child's physical and emotional health,"" Family Court Judge Colin Forrest said in making his ruling. Campaigners question surgery Some intersex campaigners have challenged the ethical basis of irreversible surgery, arguing that gender identity is complex. One advocate, Morgan Carpenter, told the BBC that children should decide their identity for themselves when they are older. ""Gender assignment is always appropriate,"" he said. ""What is not appropriate is surgically enforced gender assignment."" Mr Carpenter said he believed medical and legal professionals often wrongly approached variations in sex development as disorders in need of correction.

"Luisa Ortega, a supporter turned critic of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, has rejected her dismissal. She will face trial for ""serious misconduct"", the Supreme Court says. Meanwhile, a leading opposition figure has been returned from prison to house arrest. Leopoldo LÃ³pez was taken from his home on Tuesday and spent four days in a military jail. South American regional bloc Mercosur has suspended Venezuela ""indefinitely"", having previously placed it under a temporary ban. It says the country will not be re-admitted until the constituent assembly is scrapped and all political prisoners are released. Another opponent of the government, Antonio Ledezma, is also back under house arrest after three days in jail last week. Both opposition politicians had encouraged protests against the constituent assembly, which is dominated by government supporters. In its first session on Saturday, the assembly unanimously voted to remove Ms Ortega from her post. The lawyer was prevented from entering her office in the capital, Caracas, by dozens of National Guard officers in riot gear, and left on a motorbike amid chaotic scenes. In a statement (in Spanish) released by the public prosecutor's office, she said Mr Maduro's government was leading a ""coup against the constitution"". ""I do not recognise the decision,"" she said of her dismissal. ""[This is] just a tiny example of what's coming for everyone that dares to oppose this totalitarian form of ruling."" The Supreme Court, loyal to Mr Maduro, did not give details of the accusations against her. Ms Ortega, who broke ranks with the government in March, had opposed the assembly's inauguration on Friday, citing allegations of voting fraud. Tarek William Saab, a supporter of President Maduro, has been sworn in as her replacement. Her removal was widely expected but the fact that it was decided on the first working day of the assembly suggested that the new body could take aggressive measures against Mr Maduro's critics, correspondents say. Mexico, Peru and Colombia have condemned her dismissal. Mr Maduro says the constituent assembly is needed to bring peace after months of protests sparked by severe economic hardship. But the opposition says it is a way for the president to cling to power. The new body has the ability to rewrite the constitution, and could override the opposition-controlled parliament, the National Assembly. Julio Borges, speaker of the National Assembly, said Ms Ortega's removal was illegal and showed that the country's institutions had been ""taken hostage by only one hand, only one political party"" through ""an undemocratic mechanism that is utterly dictatorial."" Despite being oil-rich, Venezuela is experiencing severe shortages of food and medicines, as well as inflation in excess of 700%. Violent demonstrations since April have left more than 100 people dead.",Venezuela's chief prosecutor says she was sacked by the new constituent assembly because the government wanted to stop her investigations into alleged corruption and human rights abuses.
"By BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The comment by Kirill Kleimenov - the presenter on government-controlled Channel One's flagship Vremya news programme - sounded like a veiled, mocking threat to anyone considering becoming a double agent for Britain. ""I don't wish death on anyone, but for purely educational purposes, I have a warning for anyone who dreams of such a career,"" he said. ""The profession of a traitor is one of the most dangerous in the world,"" Kleimenov said, adding that few who had chosen it had lived to a ripe old age. Alcoholism, drug addiction, stress and depression resulting in heart attacks and even suicide were the ""professional illnesses of a traitor"", according to Kleimenov. 'Maybe it's the climate' He also had a second piece of advice for such ""traitors or those who simply hate their country in their free time"": ""Don't choose Britain as a place to live."" ""Something is wrong there. Maybe it's the climate, but in recent years there have been too many strange incidents with grave outcomes there."" The remarks stood out from the rest of the evening's coverage, which followed the line often taken by Russian state media in similar circumstances - denial and wry bemusement that anyone should be pointing the finger at Russia. On NTV - ultimately controlled by state gas company Gazprom - a presenter said the Western media were accusing Russia of poisoning Mr Skripal despite the lack of any evidence or any ""expert conclusions"". Its London correspondent, Liza Gerson, mentioned the role of the UK's Porton Down research facility in the investigation, pointing out that it tested chemicals used against German soldiers in World War One. She also took a swipe at Boris Johnson's warning to Russia this week, saying the foreign secretary was known for his ""unpredictable antics"" and was ""an infant in a man's suit"". Over on state channel Rossiya 1, the presenter said the British authorities ""didn't even try"" to seek Russia's co-operation in the investigation, ""but have already discovered a Russian trace in the case"". 'Anti-Russian hysteria' Before the leading TV channels picked up the story, it had been widely covered by newspapers, news websites and niche liberal outlets such as Dozhd TV and Ekho Moskvy radio, as well as the relatively little-watched state news channel Rossiya 24. ""The British media continue to fan anti-Russian hysteria,"" one Rossiya 24 report said, adding that attempts to find a ""Kremlin trace"" were based ""not on facts, but purely on rumours and fabrication"". The channel's UK correspondent reported the ""interesting detail"" that Britain's ""secret"" Porton Down facility manufactures the VX and sarin nerve agents, as well as other ""UK weapons of mass destruction"". News websites widely reported remarks by Andrei Lugovoi - a suspect in the killing of former Russian security officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - dismissing talk of a ""Russian trace"". ""The English suffer from phobias,"" Mr Lugovoi - now a member of the Russian parliament - told the RIA Novosti news agency. Dozhd TV's take was entirely different from the state media. Here, a presenter said that the discovery that Mr Skripal was poisoned by a nerve agent means ""Russia is in for a high-profile criminal investigation"".

"Cali, 53, was shot several times in the Todt Hill district of Staten Island on Wednesday evening and died later in hospital. The unidentified killer fled the scene in a blue car, witnesses said. New York media say it is the first targeted killing of a mob boss in the city since 1985. The Gambino operation is said to be one of the five historic Italian-US mafia families in New York. Police said Cali's killer shot him at least six times and then ran him over before fleeing the scene. Family members were seen to rush into the street and sit crying next to his body. The motive was not known, according to police. ""There are no arrests and the investigation is ongoing,"" a statement said. NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said in a news conference on Thursday that Cali may have been lured outside the home by a car accident before he was attacked. Detective Shea said his Cadillac SUV, which was parked outside the home, was struck leading to Cali to rush outside. After a minute-long conversation, the assassin pulled out a gun and opened fire on him, police say. ""Needless to say, with the potential organised crime angle, it gets the utmost importance [of] the NYPD and the entire detective bureau,"" the detective said, adding that video exists of the attack. First 'mob hit' since 1985 New York media say it is the first killing of a family boss in the city since the Gambino family's Paul Castellano was shot dead outside a restaurant in 1985 on the orders of John Gotti. Gotti then ran the Gambino family until he was convicted in 1992 of racketeering and five counts of murder. He died in prison in 2002. The Gambino family was once considered the biggest organised crime group in the US, but began to decline after Gotti and other senior figures were jailed. Francesco ""Franky Boy"" Cali is said to have taken over the running of the organisation from Domenico Cefalu in 2015. It is believed he only had one criminal conviction, for conspiring to extort money in 2008 for which he served 16 months in prison. Staten Island's affluent Todt Hill neighbourhood is renowned for its crime connections. It was used as the location for fictional crime boss Don Corleone's compound in the 1972 film The Godfather. Paul Castellano also owned a home there. Neighbours Will and Karen Curitore told CBS News the neighbourhood always seemed safe to them. ""We know there used to be a mob presence here,"" said Mr Curitore. ""We thought this was one of the safer neighbourhoods on Staten Island."" ""I guess unless you're in the mafia,"" Mrs Curitore added. The Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, Colombo and Bonanno mafia families are believed to have controlled organised crime in New York for decades. Last week, Carmine Persico, the 85-year-old former boss of the Colombo organisation, died after serving 33 years of a 139-year prison sentence. On Wednesday, two heads of the Bonanno family, Joseph Cammarano Jr and John Zancocchio, were acquitted in a Manhattan court of racketeering and conspiracy to commit extortion. Last October, 71-year-old Sylvester Zottola, a reputed associate of the Bonanno organisation, was shot dead at a takeaway restaurant in the Bronx, New York. The attack came three months after Zottola's son, Salvatore Zottola, was also shot, but survived.","The reputed head of New York's Gambino crime family, Frank Cali, has been killed outside his home, say the city's police."
"Prime Minister Jean Castex said the infection rates were not falling as fast as the government had hoped after a lockdown was imposed in late October. A stay-at-home order will be lifted as planned on 15 December, when the daily 20:00-06:00 curfew will begin. The measure will not be waived on New Year's Eve, to prevent big gatherings. The government had conditioned the easing of restrictions on the number of new cases falling to around 5,000 a day. But that number remains well above 10,000 - on Thursday, there were 13,750 infections. ""We aren't yet at the end of this second wave, and we won't reach the objectives we had set for 15 December,"" Mr Castex told a news conference. ""We can't let down our guard. We have to stay focused, and find our way through the next few weeks with lots of vigilance."" Museums, cinemas and theatres as well as sports venues, which were expected to reopen on Tuesday, will remain closed for an extra three weeks. The decision was criticised by some in the cultural world, with actor and director Phillipe Lellouche telling BFM TV: ""We're tired of not being given more consideration. Once more culture is being left on the side of the road."" Mr Castex has also announced that: Bars and restaurants will remain closed at least until 20 January.

"By Guy HedgecoeMadrid A ceremony is set to take place later this week in the town of Cambo-les-Bains, in south-west France. But in a letter to Basque organisations, published by El Diario website and dated 16 April, the militant group writes of ""a new opportunity definitively to end the cycle of conflict"" and acknowledges the ""suffering caused as a result of its struggle"". While Eta's days may be over, nearly half the killings attributed to the organisation have still not been fully investigated. There are many Basques, on both sides, who believe there are still issues to be resolved before true peace can be established. Eta's decades of violence Eta, deemed a terrorist organisation by the European Union, killed more than 800 people between 1968 and 2010, the year before it announced a permanent ceasefire. In April 2017 it staged a disarmament ceremony in the south of France. The majority of attacks took place in the Basque region of northern Spain and neighbouring Navarre. A total of 443 civil guards and police died at Eta's hands, according to Europa Press news agency, which reported that 58 businesspeople and 39 politicians were also among its victims. In its letter, Eta says ""years of confrontation have left deep wounds and we have to give them the chance to heal. Some are still bleeding, because the suffering is not in the past"". The terrorism victims' group Dignidad y Justicia (Dignity and Justice) says that nearly 400 deaths caused by Eta remain unresolved and it has called on the authorities to reopen the cases. ""For us there will be no end of Eta as long as there is not justice for all,"" the president of Dignidad y Justicia, Daniel Portero, told the European Parliament last year. Several dozen Spanish intellectuals and relatives of victims of Eta have presented a petition on Change.org calling on the group to offer information about its unresolved crimes and criticising what the signatories called its attempts to ""whitewash"" its crimes. Why Eta also has grievances Those who have shared Eta's ambition of an independent Basque state also complain of open wounds. A report commissioned last year by the region's government, which is led by the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), documented over 4,000 alleged cases of torture by the security forces in relation to Eta between 1960 and 2014. Only 20 torture cases have seen court sentences. Meanwhile, the Spanish government intentionally keeps most of the 243 Eta members in national jails far from their families, as part of a so-called ""dispersion policy"". ""The biggest punishment of all for the prisoners is seeing that their relatives are also being punished by the penitentiary policy,"" said Olatz Iglesias, whose father, Juan Carlos Iglesias, is serving a 29-year sentence for murder in Alicante, 700km away from their home. Only a small number of Eta members are estimated to be at large in Spain, while several dozen are believed to be living abroad, with Venezuela, Cuba and other Latin American countries their most favoured destinations. So far, Eta's moves away from violence have failed to impress the Spanish government, which has presented the group's ceasefire, disarmament and now disbandment as a drawn-out admission of defeat. With terrorism victims' groups, factions of the governing Popular Party (PP) and the conservative media all lobbying for a rigid line on Eta, there is little prospect of the government shifting its stance. A recent partial apology issued by the organisation, in which it seemed to suggest that members of the security forces had been legitimate targets, did little to change that position. ""It doesn't matter if they apologise or not to us, because we will never forgive Eta,"" said Alfonso Alonso, leader of the PP in the Basque region. After so many decades of bloodshed, Eta has little to show for its campaign. The Basque region has more autonomy than any of Spain's other 16 regions, with its own police force, education system, language and a special financial relationship with Madrid. However, these powers were granted to the region by the 1978 constitution, rather than as a result of Eta's actions. In contrast with Catalonia, where support for secession is close to 50% and nationalist parties held a banned referendum last October, support for independence within the Basque country is currently around 15% according to polls. In its letter Eta asserts that the Basque conflict with Spain and France is not over, but adds that it did not start with Eta either.","For Spain this is the end of an era. Separatist group Eta has formally announced it is disbanding, almost exactly 50 years after claiming its first victim."
"Some ideas submitted so far include turning the plastic horns into chandeliers, lamp shades, bird food dispensers and table stands. The winning design, to be announced later this month, is to be produced and sold through a local retailer. The vuvuzela reached the world's attention during the Word Cup which South Africa hosted in June and July. Competition organiser Jono Swanepoel says designs will be handed over to local manufacturers, who will receive all the proceeds from the sale of the new-look vuvuzela. ""This is ultimately designed to create jobs for crafters out there,"" he told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Many of the designs were impractical but funny, Mr Swanepoel said. ""We've seen quite a few entries of hearing aids; things to magnify the sound on your cellphone if you put it on speaker phone,"" he said. He also suggested that lamp shades could be useful in South Africa's poor communities. ""For example in lower cost houses where you have a naked light bulb hanging from a ceiling in a shack or a house."" The competition ends on 15 October and organisers say more than 200 entries have been submitted so far. A prize of 10,000 rand (Â£916; $1,460) will be distributed among the 10 best suggestions. Vuvuzelas have long been a feature of football in South Africa. But many foreign fans criticised them during the World Cup, saying they sounded like a swarm of bees and drowned out traditional football chants. Several English premiership clubs have banned them from their grounds.",A competition is drawing to a close in South Africa to find new ways to use the vuvuzela.
"State TV in April said soil tests near the school showed chemical levels at 95,000 times the national limit. But a three-month study of the air, water and soil around the school said contamination levels were within acceptable limits. It did not say what might have caused the children's sickness. The Changzou Foreign Language School in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, was built near recently-closed chemical plants. In its report in April, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said that 500 children had developed dermatitis, blood abnormalities, leukaemia and lymphoma, and nearly five out of six pupils who underwent medical checks had health problems. The report was viewed online by tens of millions of people and caused outrage across the country. Other news outlets reported that the school had been built against the advice of environmental regulators. Changzou city officials have told the official Xinhua news agency there were ""some problems with the earlier soil rehabilitation process"" but said that otherwise the investigation found few significant problems. They said there was no link between the school's location and thyroid problems the pupils had been having, adding that the rate of thyroid problems was rising in the general population.",Investigators in China say they have found no evidence that pollution caused hundreds of school pupils to become sick earlier this year.
"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent On 17 January, her battered body is recovered from a forest in Kathua district. Through February, police arrest eight men, including a retired government official, four policemen and a juvenile, in connection with the gang rape and murder of the girl. There are protests in the summer capital, Srinagar, demanding a special probe into the incident. The crime exposed the fault lines between the Hindu-majority Jammu and the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley in a sharply divided state. The incident is covered promptly and prominently by the local media in the Muslim-dominated valley. So why does this story from Kathua make it to national news networks only in mid-April? Why does it evoke delayed outrage and anger? Why does this happen only after Hindu right-wing groups protest the arrest of the accused, who also belong to a Hindu community? Why are the eventual protests in Delhi - including a midnight march by chief opposition leader Rahul Gandhi - milder than the ones after a similarly brutal gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi in 2012? The responses tell us something about modern India. The media in Delhi, many believe, exerts a disproportionate and undeserved influence over shaping the ""national narrative"". And large sections of this media have been partisan and selective when it comes to reporting on Kashmir, one of the world's most heavily militarised regions. India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir and there's been an armed revolt in the region against Indian rule since 1989. ""The biggest problem in Kashmir is the way the place has been covered in the mainland Indian media,"" wrote senior journalist and editor of The Print, Shekhar Gupta, in 2015. ""The problem has always been very closely linked to national security and military security."" So, often, the truth (about Kashmir), he wrote, ""was considered against national security"". In this instance, one could possibly cite ""religious honour"" as another reason for why most national media avoided reporting on the crime. The support shown to the accused by Hindu right wing-groups - and two ministers from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - has shocked many. Prime Minister Narendra Modi only broke his silence on Friday evening with a series of tweets, saying ""no culprit will be spared... our daughters will definitely get justice"". 'Not such a big story' A journalist who has been covering the incident in Kathua since January says that he had been telling his colleagues who work for Delhi-based news networks to report on the crime and its aftermath. ""When some of the reporters approached their offices in Delhi to tell them about the incident, the feeling was that the inauguration of a garden of tulips in the valley was a better story than the rape and murder of a girl,"" Sameer Yasir, an independent Srinagar-based journalist, told me. According to Mr Yasir, most of their bosses prevaricated, saying they didn't have enough people on the ground in Jammu, and that it was not ""such a big story"". Only one English news network has been consistently covering the story. ""I believe that media is almost tired of reporting violence in India. Rapes, lynching, torture is being reported all the time. It's almost like you have to run a torture report, like the weather report,"" says Shiv Visvanathan, a Delhi-based social scientist. It is possibly all about what Dr Visvanathan calls the ""breakdown of moral imagination"" in India. Writing in The Indian Express newspaper, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a leading public intellectual, agreed, saying the Kashmir rape and murder proves ""without exaggeration, that India's moral compass has been completely obliterated, carpet-bombed out of existence by the very custodians of law, morality and virtue who give daily sermons on national pride"". In a deeply divided society, collective action is always difficult. Outrage happens - as in this case - when graphic details of the torture inflicted on the girl stir the conscience of many. This is what happened in this case. 'Rip Van Winkle outrage' Many say the equally horrific 2012 Delhi gang-rape provoked huge protests in the capital because the victim was like ""one of us"" who was attacked on the way home with her male friend after watching a Hollywood film at a cineplex. On the other hand, the girl in Kathua was a veritable vagabond, a member of a poor nomadic community, languishing bottom-most in India's unforgiving and cruel caste hierarchy. ""Everyone is complicit - we the people, media, politicians. There's no concept of human rights anymore. There are Hindu rights and Muslim rights. Our loyalties are now to religion, caste, groups and clubs,"" says Dr Visvanathan. In this environment, say many, instant outrage and ""whataboutery"" are the two extreme emotions that violence like this provokes. The outrage waxes and wanes quickly - Dr Visvanathan calls it the ""Rip Van Winkle nature"" of outrage and indignation. ""Our reactions veer from silence to indifference to hysteria. Then we go back to sleep and wake up again to react to the latest incident of outrage"".",A bright looking eight-year old girl belonging to a Muslim nomadic tribe in Indian-administered Kashmir goes missing in the new year.
"Citing freedom of artistic expression, prosecutors in Konstanz rejected claims that the play breaks laws banning public display of Nazi symbols. Critics have branded the theatre offer ""tasteless"" and called for a boycott. The theatre says its aim is to show how easily people can become corrupted. Anyone paying up to â¬29 (Â£25; $35) for a ticket will be asked to wear a Star of David ""as a sign of solidarity with the victims of Nazi barbarism"", Theatre Konstanz says on its website (in German). But it is the theatre's offer to provide a free seat to anyone willing to accept and wear a swastika that has stirred local anger. Some 50 people have already signed up to the idea of a free seat, reports say. The theatre has made clear they will have to return the swastika after the play, which is set to open on Friday, the anniversary of Hitler's birth. Local mayor Andreas Osner accepted that the theatre should be allowed freedom of artistic expression ""but in this case they have overstepped the mark in an irresponsible way"". ""I wouldn't even like to imagine what could happen if people from the far right came to hijack the performance and used the play with the Nazi armbands for their own purposes."" George Tabori's 1987 anti-Hitler farce Mein Kampf is named after the anti-Semitic Nazi manifesto that Hitler wrote in prison before coming to power. The Hungarian playwright, who died in 2007, wrote the play as a caricature of a young Hitler trying to establish himself in the Vienna art scene before World War One. Tabori was himself Jewish and lost most of his family in the Holocaust. The theatre agreed the number of people willing to wear a swastika was surprising and frightening. But director Serdar Somuncu said his aim was to counteract an increasing tolerance in Germany towards anti-Semitism, by tackling political opponents head-on. ""This artistic impulse seeks to show how easily people are corrupted and can be made to wear the symbol of million fold suffering, just to save a few euros,"" his colleague Daniel GrÃ¼nauer added. But is it art? The head of the local Jewish community, Minia Joneck, who lost family members in Nazi death camps, certainly does not think so. She has called for ""this monstrosity"" to be stopped. The German-Israeli Society and a local group promoting interfaith dialogue have called the idea ""unacceptable"" and a ""bizarre stunt"". A spokesman for the public prosecutor's office acknowledged there had been ""several"" complaints but that there would be no investigation into the case. That is because German law bans the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations. But that does not apply where art is concerned and because the spectators are considered part of an artistic production they are not breaking German law either. The controversy comes amid warnings of a rise in anti-Semitism in Germany. In the latest incident, two young men were attacked in Berlin by a man shouting anti-Semitic abuse.",A satirical play based on Adolf Hitler's youth premieres in Germany on Friday despite complaints about an offer of free tickets to spectators willing to wear a swastika.
"Abu Zarin Hussin, a firefighter, first shot to fame after British tabloids published a story incorrectly identifying him as a Thai man who'd allegedly married his pet snake. Mr Hussin had trained other firefighters on how to handle snakes. But he was admitted to hospital on Monday after being bitten a cobra during a snake-catching operation. According to local news outlet The Star, the 33-year-old who lived in the state of Pahang, often taught other firemen how to identify different snake species and ways to capture them without having to kill. He had also participated in television programme Asia's Got Talent, where he pulled off the daring act of ""kissing"" a snake. In 2016, a story was published in Thai media - and later in several UK tabloids - naming Mr Hussin as a Thai man who'd married a snake, believing it to be his ""reincarnated girlfriend"". The stories used pictures from Mr Hussin's social media which showed him playfully spending time with snakes. Mr Hussin, who kept four snakes at home to better understand their behaviour, told reporters: ""They used my photos and started making up stories, saying that I married a snake."" He later told the BBC he was ""very disappointed"" by the fake reports.",A Malaysian man who became famous for his snake-handling skills has died after being bitten by a cobra.
"Police fired tear gas after hooded protesters smashed shop windows and set several vehicles alight. Nearly 100 rallies were planned nationwide on Saturday over the draft bill that would outlaw taking photos of police with malevolent intent. Opponents say the bill undermines press freedom to document police brutality. France has seen weekly nationwide protests over the draft bill, which intensified after footage emerged of three white policemen beating a black music producer, whom they allegedly also abused racially. Responding to the backlash, President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party said last week that parts of the law would be rewritten. However, this has not done enough to assuage its opponents. On Friday Mr Macron acknowledged ""there are police who are violent"" and said ""they need to be punished"", in a live interview with Brut, a youth-focused news portal site. What happened on Saturday? Thousands of people, including members of the anti-government Yellow Vest movement, had been marching peacefully in the capital when pockets of protesters, dressed in black and with their faces covered, started launching projectiles at riot police, Reuters reports. The windows of a supermarket, property agency and bank were smashed, according to the AFP news agency, and police responded to the violence by firing tear gas. Some of the demonstrators set up impromptu barricades in the street which they set on fire, it added. Paris police, quoted by BFM TV, said some 500 rioters had infiltrated the protest. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 22 people had been detained over the incidents. Police had been heavily deployed to the capital in a bid to avoid a repeat of the violent clashes seen there last weekend over the same law, which left dozens wounded. Peaceful protests were staged elsewhere across France, including Marseille, Lyon and Rennes. In his interview with Brut on Friday, President Macron lashed out at earlier violence in Paris, which he blamed on ""crazy people"". He said an online national platform would be launched for people to flag up unnecessary police checks, and that police would be wearing body cameras more widely from June 2021. Why are people angry about the bill? Article 24 of the proposed bill makes it a criminal offence to publish images of on-duty police officers with the intent to harm their ""physical or psychological integrity"". It says offenders could face up to a year in prison and be fined â¬45,000 (Â£40,500; $54,000). Advocates say the article will protect police from harassment and targeting on social media. But critics say media freedom and citizens' right to film police action must not be impeded, as the French police are now under intense scrutiny for alleged racism. Images of music producer Michel Zecler being kicked and punched at his Paris studio last month by three white policemen shocked the nation, and further enraged opponents to the bill. Since then, four officers have been placed under criminal investigation and members of President Macron's ruling party have pledged to ""completely"" rewrite part of the new law. ""We know that doubts persist about it...while we can never tolerate any reduction of press freedom or images,"" said Christophe Castaner, who heads Mr Macron's group of centrist MPs in parliament.",Dozens of protesters have clashed with police in the French capital Paris in fresh demonstrations against a controversial draft security law.

"The attacks, on Sunday and Monday, claimed a total of 34 lives. Thousands of police are patrolling public transport and checking traffic in the city following the attacks, which injured some 60 people.

Events for New Year's Eve, such as children's parties, have been cancelled in the city, while residents have been asked not to set off fireworks. The death toll rose overnight as a person wounded in Sunday's attack on the station died of their injuries, bringing the total fatalities in that attack to 18. Another person injured in Monday's attack on a trolleybus also died, bringing that toll to 16. Funerals The first victim to be buried on New Year's Eve was transport policeman Dmitry Makovkin, 29, killed at a metal detector in the station, where the suicide bomber set off the device. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral. His commander hailed Mr Makovkin as a hero who possibly prevented greater loss of life by preventing attackers from entering the station. A second victim was being buried on Tuesday and funerals are due to continue through the holiday period. Investigators believe a male suicide attacker bombed the trolleybus and are studying fragments of his body in an effort to identify him. Police sources say the attack on the station may also have been the work of a male bomber. Identical shrapnel was used in the bombs, according to Vladimir Markin, spokesman for Russia's Investigative Committee. Analysts say the prime suspect for the attack is likely to be Doku Umarov, a fugitive Islamist militant leader from Chechnya. He has orchestrated previous bomb attacks on Russian civilian targets, and vowed in July that his fighters would use ""any means possible"" to keep Mr Putin from staging the Sochi Games.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to fight ""terrorists until their complete annihilation"", in his first comment on two suicide attacks in the southern city of Volgograd."
"Kim Yo-jong, believed to be in her 20s, joins the ruling committee. The country's first Workers' Party Congress in 36 years ended on Monday, with Kim Jong-un becoming party chairman and cementing his rule. One of those given several new posts is Ri Yong-gi. South Korean intelligence said earlier this year he had been purged and executed for corruption. Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans joined a rally in Pyongyang to mark the end of the congress. In pictures: 'Tightly choreographed' parade Propaganda role The Korean Central News Agency, the North's state media, said Kim Yo-jong had been elected to the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee. Ms Kim has frequently appeared alongside her brother at public events. She did so again for a while on Monday as her 33-year-old older brother, wearing a traditional dark jacket buttoned up to the collar, smiled and waved to the crowds. The confirmation of her new title had been widely expected. She is already influential as vice-director of the propaganda and agitation department. Ri Yong-gi had disappeared in February, leading to speculation he had fallen foul of the leadership. But he has now been mentioned again in the media, underscoring the difficulty in following developments in the secretive North. Hundreds of thousands of people, waving pink paper flowers, coloured balloons and red party flags, marched through the square in the capital, Pyongyang. The parade also featured floats, some of them carrying mock-ups of missiles. At the scene: Stephen Evans, BBC News, Pyongyang Numbers at the rally are hard to estimate but I counted blocks of marchers 50 people wide and 50-plus people long passing for an hour, some goose-stepping holding red banners. There were tightly choreographed displays of flag waving. Others were in civilian clothes, the women in traditional Korean dress and the men in suits with a collar and tie. These did not march but leapt and bounded along the square, cheering ecstatically and gazing up at the balcony behind which Kim Jong-un sat or stood. We asked them why they were so ecstatic. The answer, invariably, was that they were so happy to see the elevation of Marshal Kim Jong-un to the chairmanship of the Workers' Party. It's very hard to know what people think. It may be a mixture. Unobtrusively I watched the faces of some North Koreans I know and their ecstasy seemed genuine. But that doesn't mean the people aren't also oppressed: numerous accounts by defectors and the absence of meaningful elections indicate they are. More than 100 foreign reporters have been granted visas to cover the congress, although only a few were, briefly, allowed in to watch the meeting. On Monday, three BBC journalists were expelled from the country for reporting which had angered the authorities. Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes was detained on Friday and interrogated for eight hours, before being made to sign a statement of apology. He and his colleagues left on Monday. The BBC said it was disappointed by North Korea's decision. The congress, which began on Friday, launched a new five-year plan for the economy, which has been hit by some of its strongest sanctions yet after the country's recent nuclear and rocket tests. Mr Kim also used a speech to say the North would not use its nuclear weapons unless its sovereignty was threatened. China has sent a message of congratulations to Mr Kim on his new position, though it declined to send a representative to the gathering. Analysts suggested this may be because of unhappiness with recent indications that Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its fifth nuclear test.",North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's sister has been given a key post at the country's rare ruling party congress.
"By Dhruti ShahBBC News The 36-year-old from Minneapolis got more than she bargained for when one day the number messaged back. Amber Leinweber, 32, of Wisconsin, was a stranger to Ruth two weeks ago but now, after bonding over shared grief and that very number, they are firm friends. And thanks to the BBC, they not only know each other's real names but have been able to speak and hear each other's voices for the first time. They had been texting all this time but not once picked up the phone. Then after the BBC story was published on Friday and read by millions around the world, Radio 4's PM programme decided to get them together on the radio show. And soon it was a case of ""Hi Amber"" and ""Hi Ruth"" as the women said hello and explained how they had been brought together. Ruth told presenter Jonny Dymond and psychologist and author Elaine Kasket: ""I had been texting [Mike's] number almost every day since he passed just to tell him jokes or you know, something I had seen during the day that reminded me of him. ""I just felt like I was still kind of talking to him. So it wasn't out of the ordinary that I was sending that text but it was out of the ordinary that somebody responded, of course."" Ruth admitted she wasn't sure whether to open Amber's response but she was glad she did: ""The second I opened it and just saw how kind and empathetic she was, I kind of knew that we had started at least a conversation that would last a while but [has] certainly turned into a friendship now. Amber said she responded because she didn't want Ruth to feel ignored, and although Ruth apologised for messaging in the first place, it was that contriteness that sparked Amber's desire to continue to listen. She said: ""The day that I got the the text it was a Sunday, I had just found out that my cousin who was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year decided to stop her treatment. ""So she was expected to pass any day. So I was really, you know, struck by what [Ruth] said - that it was her brother's number and, and then what really, really got me was the sorry at the end."" But it was after Ruth shared a screen grab of the pair's first exchanges on Reddit that the story went viral. She wrote: ""My brother passed six months ago and I still texted him frequently. Today, I got a response."" The pair plan to stay in touch, with Amber saying that she felt the two women were destined to be in touch.","When Ruth Murray texted her dead brother Mike's phone, all she sought was a connection."
"Senator Freddie Cohen wants to increase the threshold of permitted development. That means planning permission will not be needed for re-cladding a roof, or for converting loft space or garages. It is estimated that this would reduce the number of planning applications by up to 400 a year. Senator Cohen said: ""These changes will allow the department to direct its limited resources towards more important planning applications."" The minister is also raising some of the existing permitted development thresholds for extensions and conservatories, for installations of new roof lights, sun-pipes and dormer windows. Senator Cohen said: ""It will significantly increase the opportunity for islanders to improve and extend their properties without having to go through the red tape and cost of a planning application."" But he said generally these changes would not apply to listed buildings and proposed listed buildings.",Jersey's planning and environment Minister wants to make it easier for people to do building work on their properties without needing consent.
"By Farouk ChothiaBBC News Mr Trump said last week that Egypt might ""blow up"" the Ethiopian-built dam, despite boasting in January that he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize because he had ""made a deal"". ""I saved a big war. I've saved a couple of them,"" he said, shortly after Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abi Ahmed was awarded the prize. Mr Trump's comments were vague, but seemed to be a reference to his intervention - at the request of Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom he once reportedly called his ""favourite dictator"" - to resolve the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd). Egypt sees the dam as an ""existential threat"" to its survival, a concern shared, albeit to a lesser extent, by Sudan. Ethiopia, on the other hand, regards the dam as vital for its energy needs. Trump a 'hate figure for Ethiopians' Kenya-based Horn of Africa security analyst Rashid Abdi said US mediation over the dam had worsened tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia. ""Ethiopia is stepping up security around the dam,"" Mr Abdi said. ""Its defensive measures include declaring the Benishangul-Gumuz region, where the dam is located, a restricted airspace, and there are also reports that Ethiopia is putting up anti-aircraft batteries around the dam. It probably fears reconnaissance flights by Egypt."" He said this showed Mr Trump's failure to understand how global diplomacy worked. ""He has this misconceived notion that you can cut a deal like in business. So he left the US Treasury to play the lead role in negotiations, when foreign policy is supposed to be conducted by the State Department. The consequences have been to aggravate an already bad situation,"" Mr Abdi added. Accusing Ethiopia of negotiating in bad faith following its decision to press ahead with filling the dam before addressing Egypt's and Sudan's concerns about the flow of water to their countries, the US has decided to cut a reported $100m ($$77m) in aid to Ethiopia - Africa's second most-populous state, and a key US ally in the fight against militant Islamists in the volatile Horn of Africa. ""Ethiopia feels betrayed by America, and Trump is now a hate-figure for many Ethiopians,"" Mr Abdi said, adding that they would be hoping for a Joe Biden victory in the 3 November presidential election. Explore the Nile with 360 video Alastair Leithead and his team travelled in 2018 from the Blue Nile's source to the sea - through Ethiopia and Sudan into Egypt. W Gyude Moore, a senior policy fellow at the US-based Center for Global Development, said the Trump's administration decision to side with Egypt was not surprising as its most prized international goal was rapprochement between Israel and Arab League nations. Trump's diplomatic coup As Egypt had long-standing diplomatic relations with Israel, the Trump administration was not going to antagonise it at a time when it needed Mr Sisi's help to lobby other Arab states to recognise Israel, Mr Moore said. ""So, the administration became a party in the dispute over the dam, on the side of Egypt,"" he added. Its focus on achieving Arab-Israeli rapprochement also shaped its policy towards Sudan, which gave Mr Trump a major diplomatic coup by agreeing, less than two weeks before the US election, to the normalisation of relations with Israel. Although Sudan's acting foreign minister later said that the decision was subject to ratification by a still-to-be-formed legislative body, the announcement was particularly significant as the East African state had hosted an Arab League meeting in 1967 which famously declared that there will be ""no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it"". In exchange, Mr Trump, if he wins a second term, is expected to keep pushing Ethiopia to address Egypt's and Sudan's concerns over the dam, while also ensuring that Sudan is removed from the US list of ""sponsors of terrorism"", opening the way for the country to get badly needed economic aid. Mr Moore said that while the Trump administration would deserve credit if the US Congress removed Sudan from the terror list, its decision to link this to the recognition of Israel was risky for Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's government, which took power last year following the overthrow of long-serving ruler Omar al-Bashir. ""The issue of regularising relations with Israel has deeply divided Sudanese society. It could be a destabilising factor at a time when the government already has its own security challenges, and the peace is fragile,"" Mr Moore added. Tensions with China For Mr Abdi, a further concern about the effects of Mr Trump's policies on Africa was ""the new Cold War"" between the US and China. One example was the fact that China has put up its first foreign military base in Djibouti, near the American base used for air strikes against militant Islamists in Somalia, the focal point of its counter-terrorism operations in Africa, and Yemen. ""Recently, American fighter jets were coming to land. The Chinese beamed experimental laser weapons that temporarily blinded the American pilots. It was what you'd expect in a James Bond movie,"" Mr Abdi said. ""Under Trump, the US has pursued an aggressive anti-China policy while China is increasingly becoming an assertive power. It has created a dangerous situation in the Horn of Africa,"" Mr Abdi added. As part of its efforts to counter China's growing economic influence on the continent, the Trump administration unveiled Prosper Africa in 2018 as the centrepiece of its policy for the continent. ""They want to double the amount of trade between the US and Africa, both ways. So it is a very notable objective and could be of huge benefit to Africa, more than what any other administration did, but they are still trying to figure out among themselves how it is going to work,"" Mr Moore said. He added that US investments in Africa used to be primarily in Africa's oil and gas sector, but this has fallen sharply because of the growth of fracking in America. The Trump administration set up a state-funded Development Finance Corporation in 2019 to help American companies gain a foothold in Africa. ""They want to provide financing to US firms, which have been complaining that they can't compete because Chinese firms come with financing. If you just look at the IT sector, almost 70% of Africa's IT backbone is built on Chinese components,"" Mr Moore said. 'Undermining' the African Union The Trump administration has also decided to scrap the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) when it expires in 2025. It was the signature Africa policy of US Democratic President Bill Clinton, and gives African states preferential access to the US market. Mr Moore said the administration's focus was on bilateral trade deals, and it is already in talks with Kenya - the economic powerhouse of East Africa which is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative that the US believes is aimed at building a series of trade routes that will link the Asian giant with Africa, thereby strengthening its global dominance. ""The Trump administration wants a deal with Kenya, which it will then use a template for a plethora of deals with other African states,"" Mr Moore said. ""Kenya has agreed to it because it has exploited Agoa to its advantage, and does not want to lose out on trade with the US,"" Mr Moore said. This is despite the fact that African Union (AU) Trade and Industry Commissioner Albert Muchanga has expressed a preference to negotiate with ""one voice"" an ""agreement between the whole of Africa and the US"". Mr Moore said the US' decision could undermine AU efforts to integrate the economies of African states with the aim of turning the continent into the world's largest free trade area. ""It's an extension of the Trump administration's policy of not working within multilateral framework agreements."" Kenya's decision to enter into bilateral talks was not a surprise either, Mr Moore said, adding: ""The US holds the cards here because it is the market that African states want to access. No matter who is in power [after the 3 November election], Kenya will push its case for a bilateral deal unless its current access to the US market is guaranteed."" He added that Mr Biden, who served as Mr Obama's vice-president, had not yet spelled out his policy towards Africa if he won. ""A Biden administration might revert to what existed under Obama. But compared to China, whose foreign minister has started each year since 2000 with a visit to Africa, there are few high-level exchanges between the US and Africa. ""The Trump administration is not new in giving this low priority to Africa. It has just been worse,"" Mr Moore said.","For critics of US President Donald Trump, escalating tensions between two long-standing American allies, Egypt and Ethiopia, over a mega dam on a tributary of the River Nile marks the biggest diplomatic failure of his administration in Africa."
"Head of the SDF media office, Mustafa Bali, tweeted their troops were in ""direct violent clashes"". Islamic State militants are centred in the town of Baghuz in eastern Syria. Once the village is taken, the US and its allies are expected to formally declare the end of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. Despite the loss of territory, the group is still seen as a major security threat capable of mounting attacks in the region and worldwide. The group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching across Syria and neighbouring Iraq, imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. What's happening in eastern Syria? After five years of fierce battles, local forces backed by world powers have driven IS out of all but a few hundred square metres near Syria's border with Iraq. Sunday's attack began at about 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT), with air strikes aimed at weapons stores. SDF and coalition planes are involved in the assault, and the militant camp is now ablaze. But the SDF has said before that it had launched a ""final assault"". After intense air and artillery strikes on 1 March, the alliance said it had to slow down the offensive ""due to a small number of civilians held as human shields"". About 3,000 people were evacuated on Monday and another 3,500, including 500 militants who surrendered, followed on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a further 2,000 people left Baghuz, Reuters news agency reported. They were taken to an SDF checkpoint where they were searched, questioned and given food and water. Mr Bali told Reuters news agency no further civilians had come out of the town since Saturday. He also said more than 4,000 militants have surrendered in the past month. Five SDF fighters who had been held hostage by IS were also freed. But Mr Bali tweeted that the fate of other hostages remained unknown, including those of Italian priest Paolo Dall'Oglio and Lebanese journalist Samir Kassab. The final assault? By Quentin Sommerville, BBC Middle East correspondent What's left of the Islamic State group enclave is an easy target - a couple of tented encampments surrounded on all sides and under regular bombardment from coalition warplanes. But the Kurds have taken an incremental approach. Attacking Baghuz and then calling ceasefires to allow IS supporters, hostages and children to leave. Sunday saw dozens of lorries arrive to evacuate more, but only a handful of people left. This might be the final assault, or it might be another ploy to again force people to leave. The fighting won't be easy. The Islamic State group has riddled the area with homemade explosives and still has plentiful supplies of ammunition and weapons. Clearing the last enclave could take days, if not longer. It is thought that the IS leadership has already fled. Is Islamic State finished? Despite losing nearly all the territory it once held across Iraq and Syria, experts still believe the group constitutes a major threat. US National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an interview on Sunday the group had fighters ""scattered still around Syria and Iraq and that [IS] itself is growing in other parts of the world"". US President Donald Trump has previously said Islamic State was defeated, but Mr Bolton clarified the president's statements. ""He has never said that the elimination of the territorial caliphate means the end of IS in total,"" he said. ""We know that's not the case."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Timeline: Islamic State How the jihadist group rose and fell Share this chatbot. The Worldwide Threat Assessment report, presented to the Senate in January, also highlighted the continuing dangers of the group. While IS will probably not immediately aim to take new territory, the report assesses its militants will try to ""exploit Sunni grievances, societal instability and stretched security forces to regain territory in Iraq and Syria in the long term"".",The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have launched another assault on the Islamic State group's last enclave in Syria.
"Crowds lined the streets along the funeral route since early morning, despite torrential rain before midday. These military trucks were travelling the route Mr Lee's coffin took on board a gun carriage later in the day. Nazli Anwari, 64, had been waiting since 10:00 to see the procession for Mr Lee - widely known by the initials LKY. ""I came here as I'm grateful for his leadership. He had powerful energy,"" she said. The rain prompted a flurry of tweets like this from ""darliciousx"", saying the sky was crying for Lee Kuan Yew. Like many Singaporean tweeters, she had changed her avatar to a tribute image. Martin Yip of the BBC's Chinese service tweeted this image of people sheltering as they waited for the procession. Kelvin and Mandy Tan brought their two-year-old daughter Kayla to see the procession. ""We hope she remembers who he is, learns his values of hard work and respect,"" they told the BBC. BBC Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head was at the community club in Tanjong Pagar, Lee Kuan Yew's lifelong constituency. Tattoo artists Niccku Woo and Colin Ow, watching the funeral in Tanjong Pagar, told the BBC: ""LKY didn't like tattoos or long hair. But we are here because we respect him."" Anthony Andrews and his friends are all from India but working in Singapore. They were watching a screening of the funeral. ""We hope India can have our own LKY."" But not all mourned for Mr Lee, who used the country's Internal Security Act to conduct crackdowns on dissidents during his time as prime minister. Human rights activist Mr Jolovan Wham, 35, changed his Facebook profile picture to this image. ""Lee Kuan Yew was a monster to many,"" he told the BBC. ""This does not take away what he and his team has accomplished for the country, which are significant. But it is important to acknowledge his flaws and that his legacy is also one marked by despotic cruelty."" Crowds who were waiting quietly along the route erupted as the procession passed by earlier on Sunday. The BBC's Tessa Wong said that as the gun carriage left parliament, the crowds began cheering ""majulah Singapore"" - the words are considered Singapore's national cry, she says. Majulah means ""forward"" in Malay, one of the country's official languages. Black-ribboned orders of service were handed out to people watching at screenings around the island. This image shows the huge pile of flowers at Tanjong Pagar community centre as Goh Chok Tong - who succeeded Mr Lee as prime minister in 1990 - delivered his eulogy. Twitter user HeMz92 posted this image of crowds leaving the procession route after hours waiting in the rain. The ceremony was also watched around the region, by Singaporeans and others who admired Lee Kuan Yew. The BBC's Pamela Koh sent the image above from the Singaporean consulate in Hong Kong. Back in Singapore, Tessa Wong says many people in Tanjong Pagar stayed in their seats after the funeral broadcast ended, visibly moved.",Heavy rain and a gun salute marked the beginning of the funeral of Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

"Law Wan-tung was accused of causing grievous bodily harm, criminal intimidation and failure to pay wages. The maid, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, drew global attention last year when she returned to Indonesia and needed hospital treatment. She testified in court in December that she was abused by Law for several months before she was sent home. The case drew intense scrutiny in Hong Kong, where a significant number of families rely on domestic helpers. The city's residents employ about 300,000 maids from other parts of Asia. Law was found guilty of 18 out of 20 charges laid against her. The two charges she was not found guilty of related to her treatment of another maid. She is due to be sentenced later this month. Ms Erwiana told AFP news agency after the verdict that she was ""very happy"". She also got down on her knees and said a prayer of gratitude outside the court room. During the trial the court heard that Law beat Ms Erwiana with various objects including a mop and a hanger - at one point knocking her unconscious - and deprived her of proper food. At one point Law shoved a vacuum cleaner tube into Ms Erwiana's mouth and twisted it, injuring her lips; on another occasion Law punched the maid so hard that her incisor teeth fractured. Ms Erwiana and her father told the South China Morning Post that when she returned home in January 2014, Ms Erwiana only weighed 25kg, half her usual weight. She had bruises all over her body. Law's defence lawyers had accused Ms Erwiana of being ""opportunistic"" and argued she sustained her injuries because of her clumsiness. Law denied all the abuse charges laid against her, but admitted to a separate charge of not buying insurance for Ms Erwiana. The BBC's Alice Budisatrijo in Jakarta says the case has drawn attention in Indonesia because Hong Kong, which has laws to protect maids, is seen as relatively safe for Indonesian domestic workers compared to other countries. Photographs of Ms Erwiana looking emaciated and sickly in an Indonesian hospital last year caused outrage in her home country, while the case also triggered protests by migrant workers in Hong Kong. Ms Erwiana was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people last year. Amnesty International in 2013 published a report alleging that maids were being abused and exploited in Hong Kong, and called on the city's government to resolve the issue. The human rights group said on Tuesday that the guilty verdict for Law was a ""wake-up call"" for the government to stop exploitation and a ""damning indictment"". ""The Hong Kong authorities can no longer bury their heads in the sand and dismiss horrific abuses as isolated incidents. Concrete action to end laws and regulations that foster such horrific abuse is long overdue,"" said the group's Asia Pacific migrant rights researcher Norma Kang Muico.",A Hong Kong woman has been found guilty of abusing an Indonesian maid in a high-profile case of mistreatment.
"Mountaineer Nimsdai Purja, a member of the group, said they reached the peak at 17:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Dozens of climbers have been on the 8,611m (28,251ft) mountain this winter hoping to achieve the same feat. But one Spanish mountaineer has died after suffering a fall this weekend while descending. K2, which is only 200m shorter than Everest, is part of the Karakoram Range that straddles the Pakistan-China border. One of only 14 mountains higher than 8,000m, it is widely considered the most demanding of all in winter. It has long been referred to as ""the savage mountain"", a name that stuck after US mountaineer George Bell said of his own attempt in 1953: ""It is a savage mountain that tries to kill you."" Among the most treacherous sections is the notorious ""bottleneck"", a couloir liable to icefalls. Eleven climbers were killed there in an avalanche in 2008. The Nepali climbers were initially spread across three of four competing teams - in all, totalling 60 people. But the 10 Nepalis later formed into a single group to claim the historic achievement in Nepal's name. Mountaineer Nirmal Purja - a former member of the UK's Special Boat Service - shared an image of the group celebrating their achievement, which was confirmed by expedition organiser Seven Summit Treks. ""We are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible,"" said Mr Purja. Since the first attempt in 1987-1988, just a handful of winter expeditions have been attempted on K2. Until now, none has reached higher than 7,650 metres. Nepali guides, usually ethnic Sherpas, are considered the backbone of the climbing industry around the Himalayas, and regularly help foreign mountaineers on expeditions. News of the group's success on Saturday has been praised on social media and sparked joy within the Nepalese climbing community - often left out of the spotlight. ""For decades, Nepalis have assisted foreigners to reach the summits of the Himalayas, but we've not been getting the recognition we deserve,"" said Kami Rita, speaking to AFP. ""It is wonderful that today on K2 10 Nepalis have made history and shown our bravery and strength,"" added Mr Rita, who has climbed Everest a record 24 times. As news of their success broke, it was also confirmed that another climber, Spaniard Sergi Mingote, died after experiencing a severe fall. Mr Mingote, 49, was based with another team and had been descending to K2's base camp when he slipped and fell. An experienced mountaineer, Mr Mingote had previously climbed seven of the world's so-called ""8000ers"", including Everest. He had been attempting to summit K2 without oxygen but became severely fatigued, forcing him to abandon the expedition.

"The entrance, which usually has long queues, was largely empty on Monday as officials waited for visitors. New safety measures include a ban on group photos, temperature checks at the entrance and digital tickets. The monument will allow only 5,000 visitors daily as India reports record Covid-19 cases every day. The 17th-Century marble mausoleum was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his queen, Mumtaz Mahal. It has long been one of the leading tourist attractions, and drew as many as 70,000 people every day before the pandemic. It was last shut briefly in 1978 when Agra city, where it is located, flooded. And before that, the monument closed for a few days in 1971, during a war between India and Pakistan. Selfies allowed, but no 'group photos' The entire campus was sanitised before the doors opened at 8am and all officials were seen wearing masks and face shields, local journalist Yogesh Kumar Singh, who was at the monument when it opened, told the BBC. India has reported more than five million cases so far, and Uttar Pradesh, where the Taj is located, has the country's fifth-highest caseload. Authorities said there would be temperature checks at the entrance, and visitors would be asked to use digital payment methods to buy tickets. They have also been told to follow social distancing on the property. While visitors can take selfies or solo photographs, group photos are not allowed. 'It doesn't feel like the Taj' ""But there is no rush, it feels so unlike Taj Mahal,"" Mr Singh said. ""I think many people will not turn up as long as cases continue to spike."" Mr Singh added that it would be interesting to see how authorities enforce safety rules when large groups start visiting the site. The Taj is surrounded by gardens where visitors spend a lot of time walking around and posing for photographs. But the mausoleum itself is a closed space, with almost no ventilation, making it vulnerable to Covid-19 transmission. Typically, it is crowded as tourists move in and out of it in long lines. Gautam Sharma, who drove from Delhi to visit the Taj Mahal on Monday, said he had been waiting for the day for months. ""I knew not many people will turn up initially, so I thought it will be safe to visit the monument in the first few days of reopening,"" he said. It is perhaps India's most famous monument and is usually part of every foreign dignitary's itinerary. US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania visited the Taj in February. Other world leaders who have visited the monument include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",Few people turned up to see the iconic Taj Mahal when it reopened its doors after six months - the longest it has ever been shut.
"The Fisheries Management Agreement means all commercial fishing within the Bailiwick's 12 nautical miles (nm) has to be licensed. It also means Bailiwick vessels need licences to fish in EU and UK waters. However, the lack of a quota policy has led to the UK suspending licences held by Bailiwick vessels from Saturday. This decision does not prevent any Bailiwick fishermen from continuing to fish in local waters in accordance with their licences, but does prevent Bailiwick vessels from fishing in EU waters, which includes those of the UK. Guernsey's Commerce and Employment Department said it was ""surprised and shocked at the short notice and lack of consultation"". It said George Eustice MP, UK Fisheries Minister, explained the move was in response to the States of Guernsey's policy of not applying UK quota controls to Bailiwick vessels in Bailiwick waters in accordance with the FMA. The BBC has approached the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for comment. The Commerce and Employment department said not applying the UK quotas had been agreed in the Fisheries Management Agreement. It warned the imposition of the quotas could make many island fishing businesses ""unviable"". Minister Kevin Stewart said: ""This decision by the minister of state has come out of the blue. ""Commerce and Employment is working with the fishing industry to ensure that its interests are robustly represented, at the same time as continuing to protect Bailiwick waters as a sustainable fishery."" He said his department was waiting for details of the suspension before any decision would be taken on banning licensed UK fishermen from Bailiwick waters. Mr Stewart said: ""[The decision] does not mean a free-for-all in our fishing grounds."" The department said a briefing for the Bailiwick-wide fishing industry was being organised for next week.

"""It became apparent that [the security forces] were all keen to see the back of Mahinda Rajapaksa,"" says a worker at a counting station in Colombo who spent the day chatting to police and army officers on duty for the presidential election. If it is true that the security forces had had enough of President Rajapaksa, such views have been rarely aired. His government had poured money into the defence budget. He coasted to victory in earlier elections by capitalising on his war victory over the Tamil Tigers, for which most of the Sinhalese majority respected him, brushing aside the evidence of wide-scale Tamil civilian casualties. He and his family occupied many senior government roles, and built fortunes. The Rajapaksas are widely said to control more than 70% of the economy; in conversation Mahinda would often be referred to simply as ""Him"". Their dominance has fostered a curious climate, where democratic discourse is circumscribed. Large demonstrations happen, but usually on fairly apolitical subjects like education. Rallies on issues like human rights are relatively small and are often met by staged counter-demos from pro-government mobs. Some journalists attack the government, but mostly in English, which is not widely understood. Few have been able to raise the subject of atrocities from the war era, which is the subject of a UN investigation. The allegations are against both the security forces and the Tamil Tigers. But most of the Tigers are dead, allowing the authorities to portray the issue as a stick that the UN used to beat Sri Lanka while ignoring the many Sinhalese victims. The few that mention war crimes are labelled ""traitors"" - something the surprise victor Maithripala Sirisena did while he was a minister. The government has stuck to the line that civilian casualties were minimal - further inflaming the profound distress of the tens of thousands of Tamils who bore the brunt of them. Mr Sirisena says he wants to end the island's growing isolation. One big question is whether he will now co-operate with the UN inquiry into the war, or limit himself to a domestic probe. The two biggest minorities - Tamils and Muslims - voted for Mr Sirisena in large numbers, and probably swung the vote his way. Their vote was more anti-Rajapaksa than pro-Sirisena. Mr Sirisena was picked by the unwieldy opposition coalition for his Sinhalese appeal, and he has done little to reach out to the minorities on the campaign trail. It will be difficult for him to ignore their grievances now, including constitutional changes for a settlement of the ethnic grievances that fuelled the long war. Questions also surround Bodu Bala Sena - the hard-line Buddhist monks' organisation that has peddled hatred and violence against Muslims and some Christians for the past two years. Will it simply disappear with the demise of a government that at the very least tolerated it? Victims of other human rights abuses - including many dating from before the Rajapaksa era - will also be seeking redress. Will the Fourth Floor of the Criminal Investigation Department continue to be a place notorious for torture, or will that change? Will people like Shiromani Prabagaran, whose husband was abducted in a Colombo street in 2012 and never seen again, get answers on the fate of their close family? It is too early to tell. But Mr Sirisena has made firm promises on the rule of law. He has vowed to abolish the constitutional change that allowed presidents unlimited terms and eroded their accountability. He is to hold parliamentary elections on 23 April, leading to a national government of all elected parties. Reports also say he is ready to reinstate Shirani Bandaranayake, the former chief justice whose sacking Mr Rajapaksa engineered two years ago. Geopolitically, Sri Lanka has drawn ever close to China for loans and investment in building new infrastructure. The resultant new motorways and restored railways have been impressive, but Beijing's involvement has provoked a nervy response from traditional ally India. Mr Sirisena says he will treat key Asian countries - India, China, Pakistan and Japan - equally. Mr Sirisena's coalition will struggle to stick together. At its core is the United National Party, generally seen as pro-business and moderately pro-Western, which was at the helm during some of the most controversial and blood-soaked episodes in the island's modern history. The coalition also includes former Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga, under whose rule an abortive ceasefire agreement was signed; and a Buddhist nationalist party that takes an exceptionally hard, anti-devolution line on the Tamil issue. Placating all these elements, and keeping Tamils and Muslims minimally well-disposed towards him, will not be easy for the new President Sirisena.","After a decade in charge of his country, Mahinda Rajapaksa has been dumped out of office in a shock election defeat. The BBC's former Sri Lanka correspondent Charles Haviland assesses his time in office, and the challenges he leaves to his successor."
"Linda Barton set up the website Guernsey Salvage to try to stop useful building materials going to landfill. She said she had been inspired by the appetite for old materials, such as mantle pieces, chimney pots and paving stones, in the UK. Tina Norman-Ross, recycling officer, said it was a way for items to be found a new home instead of being dumped. Waste export She said it fitted well alongside the department's objective to reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfill. The department runs its free recycling site at Longue Hougue, where items can be dropped off and collected for free. The salvage website allows people to list materials for sale and through it can be contacted by potential buyers. Mont Cuet, the island's only landfill site, is expected to be full by 2022. The States is currently investigating a new strategy involving the export of the island's waste combined with a gradual increase in the recycling of waste to 70% by 2025.",A new private salvage scheme set up in Guernsey has the support of the States department responsible for waste.
"Alphonse Le Gastelois lived on a tiny reef for 14 years after being the target of a hate campaign. Jersey Police arrested Mr Le Gastelois in 1960 while hunting for a serial sex offender nicknamed the Beast of Jersey. After 14 hours of questioning they found nothing to connect him to the attacks on women and children. But his name was released to the press and he became the subject of a hate campaign in Jersey. He was forced to flee to Ecrehous, a tiny reef between Jersey and France, and only returned when the real offender, Edward Paisnel, was caught and sentenced. 'Quick to judge' In 1999, the States agreed to pay Mr Le Gastelois Â£20,000 in compensation. Jean Le Maistre was a States member at the time, and voted in favour of giving him the money. He said: ""I think there was a genuine concern of injustice that had been done and it was probably a token of support to redress the injustice. ""Whether the figure was right I'm not sure... for him it would have been a lot of money and it would have gone some way to say sorry on behalf of the community."" Mr Le Maistre added: ""I think as time passes we tend to forget what the level of concern and fear was at that time. ""There were a number of stories circulating of how youngsters who had been assaulted in their bedrooms, with an individual breaking into the house without waking parents. ""This went on for years and this is why perhaps Alphonse had the finger pointed at him and the community were very quick to judge."" Mr Le Gastelois died on Sunday at the age of 97. His family said he would be sadly missed.",A man who went into exile after being falsely accused of sex crimes in Jersey in the 1960s has died aged 97.
"Public Security Minister for Tabasco state Audomaro Martinez Zapata said thieves had ""ransacked"" the tracks of their nails and metal plaques. Eight of the cargo train's 12 carriages came off the tracks on Sunday. Twenty-two people were injured in the accident near Huimanguillo. Tens of thousands of migrants board the train, known as La Bestia, or the Beast, each year in their attempt to reach the United States in search of better living conditions. Rescue workers fear more people may still be trapped beneath the carriages. Perilous journey It is not known exactly how many migrants may have been on the train's roof or clinging to its sides at the time of the accident. Local residents said they had seen some 200 people climb aboard at a nearby stop. Hundreds die or lose limbs each year as they fall off the train and get caught under its wheels. Three of the dead in Sunday's accident were Honduran citizens. Soldiers have been deployed to the remote area to help with the rescue work. Railway company workers said the tracks had become loose after nails and plaques keeping them in place had been stolen. Heavy rain further washed away some of the underlying soil, causing the tracks to shift, the workers told local official Andres Dominguez Aguilar. Tabasco state governor Arturo Nunez said the train's heavy load of scrap metal also may have caused the tracks to sink in the wet ground. Heavy lifting equipment has been sent to the area to move the overturned carriages.",Local officials in the southern Mexican state of Tabasco have blamed missing nails in the track for a train derailment which has killed at least six people.
"By Damian GrammaticasBBC News, Lhasa China is bringing development to Tibet, changing it, trying to make it modern, but some Tibetans are worried that their region's unique identity is being eroded. Our was a rare, Chinese government-controlled trip to Tibet. Our schedule and our movements were almost entirely controlled by official minders who rarely let us out of their sight. Almost all the people we spoke to were hand-picked to show us China's view of Tibet. Handsome wages One way things are changing in Tibet is evident at the 5,100 Mineral water factory four hours drive outside Lhasa. Bottles of mineral water fly along production lines imported from Germany. The name comes from the altitude of the glacier that feeds water to the factory, 5,100 m (16,700ft) above sea level. The water is sold in China's far-off cities. The factory brings jobs and money to a poor region. Around 150 Tibetans work here, among them Pubu Zhaxi. He says the work is not hard and he earns 5,000 renminbi ($735, Â£491) a month, a handsome wage in Tibet. But it is not all quite so simple. The factory, it turns out, is owned by a company registered in Hong Kong, so the profits, and the water, really flow outside Tibet. And although the factory's boss says collecting the run-off from the glacier has no environmental impact, the water would have flowed into a wetland in the valley where yak herds graze the mountain grasses. Ancient structure In Lhasa too there are signs of change all around. The Potala Palace, rising high above the city, was once home to the Dalai Lama before he fled into exile. It is a symbol of the way, for centuries, Tibet resisted outside influence. But now the palace courtyard is full of Chinese visitors. They pose in Tibetan cowboy hats. Tourism is another plank in China's plan for development. Qiangba Gesang, the director of the Potala Palace says that four years ago 370,000 tourists were allowed to visit the palace each year. Now the number has gone up to 600,000. It is a sign of the way China's economy is developing and of the way Tibetans are becoming richer too, he says. But he is not so clear when asked if the surge in numbers is having any impact on the ancient structure. Comfort? The influx of Han Chinese as tourists and migrants is altering Tibet. So too is China's policy of moving every Tibetan herder and farmer into a new home. We are taken to see one model project just outside Lhasa. Neat rows of grey stone houses stand in lines with Tibetan prayer flags fluttering from them. China says it has constructed 230,000 of what it calls these ""comfort houses"" for 1.3 million Tibetans in the past four years. It gives grants to help pay the cost. But the Tibetans have to use their own savings too and take out loans, so they end up with debt. And, we are told, many of the Tibetans in this village have leased their farmland to Chinese migrants to raise money. The Chinese grow vegetables while the Tibetans now work on construction sites in Lhasa. So Tibet's demographics are shifting. Backwardness Inside one house we find Do Bu Jie. In his seventies, he wears a brown Fedora hat at a jaunty angle. On his wall, as in every house we see here, there is a poster of China's Communist leaders, from Mao Zedong to Hu Jintao. Below it is a huge television set. Do Bu Jie is a Communist Party member and supporter of the housing project. ""Our old house was made out of mud, it wasn't this good,"" he said. ""I was just a farmer. But the Communist Party looks after us."" China's government genuinely believes its policies are helping transform Tibet from what officials say was a state of ""backwardness"". But while some Tibetans are benefiting, many are not convinced. They believe the economic gains are largely flowing to Chinese immigrants. And they say their way of life and their cultural identity are all under threat. Railway boom The number of Chinese moving to Tibet is a sensitive topic. When I asked for figures from officials in Beijing before our trip I was given a stern lecture about the bias foreign journalists have in reporting on Tibet. Then I was told the statistics are not kept. But in Lhasa we were taken to the new railway station, a giant, modern building, echoing and empty. Its style vaguely echoes the Potala Palace. The railway is Beijing's biggest investment in Tibet, costing billions of dollars, and is designed to connect the region with the rest of China. A train pulls in and passengers fill the platform. There are Chinese migrant workers, dragging sacks of possessions, Tibetans with bundles of goods, Chinese tour groups all wearing red caps, the tour-leader waving her flag, and a few foreign tourists too. We are told 3,000 passengers come here everyday, so roughly one million a year, a third of them visitors. In snatched conversations we managed with Tibetans during our five-day tour it was clear the sheer number of Han Chinese flowing in to Tibet was a cause of resentment. Chinese vs Tibetan Another sensitive topic is the survival of Tibetan as a language. At the Tibet Shanghai Experimental School, so-called because it is built with funds from the Shanghai government, a class full of Tibetan children in red and white track-suits are all having a Chinese lesson. Nine hundred of the students here come from the families of farmers and herdsman, we are told. Many get help from the central government with funding to enjoy this education. It is another showcase project. But although the school says teaching Tibetan is a priority, on closer scrutiny, that does not seem to be the case. Half the teachers are Chinese, and only Tibetan language is taught in Tibetan. No other subject is. All the exams, except for Tibetan language, have to be written in Chinese. Even the signs around the school and the names of the classrooms are all in Chinese. And the curriculum is all Chinese too. So the children, we are told, are taught that the Dalai Lama is a threat to China. It is clear China's drive for development is transforming Tibet, improving incomes and changing lives. But it seems that is not always being welcomed. For all the benefits China says it is bringing them, the impression left by our visit was that Beijing is struggling to win the consent of ordinary Tibetans. And in a generation's time their homeland may have changed irrevocably.",High in Tibet's mountains there are fears that an ancient way of life is slowly dying.
