"An effort to raise cash for a role-playing video game was exposed as a fraud by users of Reddit, Something Awful and other sites. The project had $4,739 (£2,922) in pledges out of a target of $80,000 at the point it was pulled by its creator. Kickstarter could not provide comment at this time. The site has successfully funded nearly 22,000 schemes since it was created in 2009. Mythic offers Mythic: The Story of Gods and Men had promised ""gameplay characteristics will be similar to that of World of Warcraft and the graphics quality should be up there with Skyrim"". The commitment to compete on an equal footing with big budget titles and a claim that ""animations will be done via motion capture thanks to some friends at Disney/Pixar"" raised suspicions. The scheme also offered supporters the chance of being motion captured so that they could appear as a ""god"" in the game, a life-sized sword and a copy of the soundtrack recorded ""at the Disney Studios"" if they gave enough money. Internet users subsequently reported that teaser screenshots had been copied from unrelated concept art and graphic design tutorial websites. 'Worried' No money transferred hands as Kickstarter only charges backers' credit cards if a project attracts enough support before a time limit expires. However, some users have raised concerns about whether the site was doing enough to vet applicants. ""What worried me the most is how Kickstarter allowed this to be posted in the first place,"" wrote David Kononen on the site's comments page. ""A simple Google search, and I found out for myself this was very shady."" The person responsible for the scam may have been trying to capitalise on the success of another video game. The studio Double Fine recently raised over $3.3m from more than 87,000 backers to develop a new point-and-click adventure. That sum has since been eclipsed by Pebble, an effort to build an e-paper based watch which has raised close to $7.7m in pledges, smashing its $100,000 goal with more than a fortnight to go before its deadline.",Crowdsourced funding site Kickstarter has suffered its first publicised scam.
"But despite the cameras, sensors and radars being introduced, it is still expected to be years before the vehicles become fully self-driving. Tesla introduced its Autopilot system last year, allowing some self-drive functions such as auto-braking. But it is now temporarily disabling Autopilot on all new cars to allow ""robust"" testing with the new systems. Gathering data Tesla founder Elon Musk said its hardware was ""basically a super-computer in a car,"" but added it would be up to regulators and the public to decide when self-driving vehicles could actually be used on the roads. He said it made sense to build in the self-driving tech now - even if it cannot be used for some time - because trying to retrofit the hardware at a later stage would cost consumers more than buying a new vehicle. For now, the hardware will run in ""shadow mode"", gathering information on when the technology may have caused or avoided accidents had it been in command of the vehicle. Mr Musk said he hoped that Tesla could one day show regulators significant data which demonstrated the self-driving technology was safer than having humans behind the wheel. Investor confidence boost - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This is a statement of intent from Elon Musk but there's no real technological leap. Google and pretty much everyone else in this game has the necessary sensor technology at the ready, but the research and development task in making the computer smart enough to intelligently work out what is going on around it. That's what's holding self-driving technology back right now. What Tesla will gain by doing this, however, is a huge fleet of cars gathering data on the world's roads, something which could hasten the introduction of self-driving technology. It's an announcement that seems more designed to keep up investor confidence that Tesla is still worth backing despite missing sales and revenue targets over the past year. He'd promised they'd be comfortably making a profit by now, but he certainly hasn't managed that. Press attack Tesla has an Autopilot feature in its Model S and Model X vehicles, allowing them to automatically change lanes and keep up with traffic. But it suffered a setback in May when a man was killed driving a Tesla Model S while using the Autopilot function. A preliminary US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report into the incident said the driver had been speeding moments before he collided with a lorry. Mr Musk was critical of press coverage of this and other related Autopilot accidents, saying there had been a ""paucity of media coverage of the 1.2 million people that die every year in manual crashes"". He claimed that publishing such negative stories risked dissuading people from using autonomous car tech, which would result in deaths. To underline the point, he retweeted an account of how Autopilot had prevented a Tesla Model X rear-ending another car. But one expert said it was right that critical articles be published. ""It's a revolutionary technology, so it's inevitable that it will attract a lot of attention,"" said Prof David Bailey from Aston Business School. ""If it was positive attention he wouldn't be complaining. But the point is that the press will pick up on things that go wrong, and things will go wrong. ""This technology will radically change the way we get around our cities, and as it's introduced it's absolutely right that it be scrutinised both by policy makers and the media."" New customers In its last set of financial results, Tesla said it had missed production targets, saw sales below expectations and reported its thirteenth consecutive quarterly loss. In April, Tesla unveiled plans for its Model 3 vehicle, its lowest-cost to date, due for release next year. It has been reported that so far 400,000 have been pre-ordered. That vehicle will now also include the new hardware. The basic model will start at $35,000 (£28,500) and have a range of at least 215 miles (346km) per charge. Analysts say the price and range of the five-seater should make the vehicle appeal to new types of customers and could boost interest in other electric vehicles. The firm faces competition from other similarly priced electric cars that will become available first, including General Motors' Chevy Bolt and BYD's Qin EV300.",Electric carmaker Tesla says all cars it now builds will have hardware needed to drive completely on their own.
"HBO also said Saturday's online leaks of four episodes had come from within a group that had received preview DVDs. Twitter maintains that the Periscope app complies with US copyright law. But HBO indirectly criticised the video streaming company. ""In general, we feel developers should have tools which proactively prevent mass copyright infringement from occurring on their apps and not be solely reliant upon notifications,"" HBO said in a statement. Periscope's terms and conditions make it clear that users should respect intellectual property rights, but the app currently only reacts to copyright infringement allegations rather than trying to prevent them happening in the first place, HBO believes. The long-awaited series five of Game of Thrones aired in the US on Sunday and in Europe on Monday. 'Hundreds of millions' Copyright infringement has been a huge issue for HBO. Episodes of the first four series of Game of Thrones were illegally downloaded more than seven million times between 5 February and 6 April this year, according to piracy specialist Irdeto, as marketing for the new series ramped up. This was a 45% increase on the same period last year, the company said. But over the history of the series, illegal downloads had run into the ""hundreds of millions"", Ernesto Van der Sar, of the Torrentfreak news website, said. And the first episode of the new series had been downloaded up to five million times, he said. ""In my view, Periscope is a non-issue [for Game of Thrones] because the show is already posted online at very high quality on several other services,"" he says. ""But mobile live streaming could be more of an issue for live sporting events like football matches.""","Games of Thrones broadcaster HBO has sent ""take down"" notices to Periscope, the live-streaming video app owned by Twitter, after users of the app broadcast episodes of the hit show on Sunday night."
"An independent expert was appointed in November to investigate whether the current process was ""fit for purpose"". After studying evidence from creative industry leaders,Richard Hooper concludedthat existing systems ""need to be streamlined"". It paves the way for the creation of a ""Digital Copyright Exchange"". The system would act as a ""one-stop shop"" database collating copyright information from a range of industries that could be accessed online. Richard Hooper, a former deputy chairman of the broadcast regulator Ofcom, said such a move would help small and medium-sized businesses launch new digital services over broadband and mobile networks - potentially creating the next Spotify or Netflix. He added it should also prove beneficial for existing media giants. ""[This] will drive economic growth across the UK's creative and technology industries,"" he told the BBC. ""Also if the media companies are seen to be doing everything possible to enable and encourage new digital services via easier and more streamlined copyright licensing, then that makes it easier for politicians to be even tougher against copyright infringement."" 'Complex and confusing' Among the evidence considered by the inquiry was a submission concerning the Victoria and Albert museum's struggle to clear picture rights. The V&A was said to have spent 125 working days and £14,000 to track down who owned the rights to 270 still images it needed to clear for one of its exhibitions. The education body Scotland's Colleges also wrote in to highlight the problems its members faced having to seek permission to use teaching materials from nine different copyright-collecting agencies. It said: ""Licences are complex and confusing and difficult to understand by the majority of those working in further education."" Mr Hooper said that the BBC had also highlighted that rights clearances had become very labour intensive, noting that it was currently spending about £10m a year on the issue. ""The BBC would like a copyright licensing regime in place which reflects the needs of a digital converged world - a world increasingly dominated by high-volume, low-value transactions as opposed to the low-volume, high-value transactions that were a feature of the analogue era,"" its statement read. Mr Hooper said he planned to issue a final report to Business Secretary Vince Cable in July which will suggest either the creation of a Digital Copyright Exchange or some other industry-funded solution.","Copyright licensing needs to be made easier and cheaper to use to support the UK's digital economy, according to a government-commissioned study."
"By Daniel EmeryBBC Technology reporter PC Zone magazine, the sometimes anarchic and irreverent monthly journal, is set to close after 225 issues on 2 September 2010. Future Publishing, which owns the title, said the closure comes in the wake of a strategic review of its PC games portfolio At its last audit, PC Zone was only selling about 11,000 copies a month. The magazine started life in a rather dank and dusty basement in Central London. It rose from the ashes of Zero, a monthly multi-format games magazine that, like PC Zone, was full of off-beat humour, adolescent jokes and, on occasion, courted controversy. Zero closed down on October 1992. However, most of the staff were retained and formed the core staff of the new, single-format magazine, PC Zone. The concept of PC gaming was a new one in the early 1990s. Games had traditionally been published on dedicated game consoles, such as the the Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), along with the legacy generation of micro-computers. Renegade PR's Tim Ponting, who published the magazine from its first issue untill late 2002, told BBC News that publishing it was perceived as 'madness' by many. ""At the time, the received wisdom was that no one would buy it,"" he said. ""But, it was a huge success, and the humour followed the legacy left by Zero magazine. It was public schoolboy, very clever, holier-than-though, but it worked,"" he added. Cover disk Three issues in, the decision was taken to give away a free CD Rom every issue, full of game demos. At the time, the internet was in its infancy, so it was the only way gamers could get their hands on them. This was a massive step. Magazines had traditionally only had a 3.5"" floppy disk, with 1.5mb of data. CD Roms had 650mb of space, which meant creating the role, unheard of in magazine publishing at the time, of disk editor. This was my first step into journalism - before joining the BBC - and, despite a massive learning curve, things went swimmingly. At first. Two years later, the format of the magazine changed significantly with the appointment of a new editor, John Davison. ""He was much younger. He took games more seriously than the previous editors but the humour less so,"" said Mr Ponting. ""The style of the magazine changed and a slew of new writers came onboard; the magazine developed a life of its own."" One of these was Charlie Brooker. Fresh out of polytechnic, he initially worked for the magazine producing the occasional game-orientated cartoon. ""I thought you had to be qualified to be a writer,"" he told BBC News. ""David McCandless [one of the writers on PC Zone] suggested I tried writing and the rest is history. ""PC Zone is where I learnt to write, because when you have to do a five page review on an abstract game, you end up filling it with a few puerile jokes and a 'snideways' look at the world,"" he added. The magazine enjoyed record sales, although not without a few stumbles. Disaster My 'faux pas extraordinaire' occurred when I made a CD Rom filled with a thousand Doom levels downloaded from the internet. Doom was the biggest selling PC game at that point in time, and it was easy for users to create their own custom levels. Trouble was, trying to download and fill a CD Rom in two days, especially on a slow dial-up modem, meant that there wasn't any chance to actually check the levels before we put them on a disk. Nine hundred and ninety nine levels were fine, but one of them contained adult content. Not exactly the sort of thing you want on a magazine aimed at teenagers. Charlie Brooker also came a cropper. One of the biggest games at the time was Tomb Raider. The heroine, Lara Croft, had to battle hundreds of animals and so Mr Brooker created a cartoon parodying the game. ""It was a mock advert for a zoo that encourages people to kill animals,"" he said. ""It was based on Lara, but they were worried it would annoy Eidos [the games publishers] so they pulled that part and the end result was in very poor taste."" The cartoon featured a young boy beating a monkey round the head with a claw hammer. Tim Ponting described it as the ""lowest point"" of his stewardship of the magazine. On both occasions, the magazine was pulled from the shelves, although - in an ironic twist - they remain some of the best selling issues of all time. However, the magazine was riding the wave of laddish humour and sales were at an all time high. But the explosion of internet use and the dot com crash spelt an end to the so-called golden times. Change Sales of the magazine started a slow decline, old staff started to drift away and puerile humour was no longer in vogue. In 2004 the magazine was sold to Future Publishing, who imposed stricter budgetary controls, brought in new staff and redesigned the magazine. But outside events were taking their toll. Internet speeds had increased dramatically since the early days of dial-up modems, the console market had exploded, with the release of the new PlayStation and Xbox and a slew of gaming websites had sprung up. People could now get their game demos and review with the click of a mouse, rather than waiting for their fix once a month. The magazine circulation continued to decline with many industry experts expressing surprise that the magazine lasted as long as it did. ""The closure of PC Zone is the end of an era,"" said Mr Brooker. ""When I was writing for it, in the mid-90s, people were buying the mag on the basis of the CD, and you can get it all on the net now. ""Also, with the growth of consoles, its being assailed on two fronts, because every game I now want to play is on a console. So they were supporting a dying game format on a dying media format. ""It's a shame, but somewhat inevitable,"" he added. Still life But Richard Shoemaker, who was the deputy editor on PC Zone, does not think PC gaming, nor magazine publishing, is dead. ""Most PC games are now sold via digital distribution, and people like Steam don't tell us what they are selling,"" he said ""Just look at Activision; World of Warcraft is one of their biggest titles and that only playable on PC. ""There will always be a place for niche magazines, such as the developers magazine Edge. ""The end of Zone is sad but inevitable. It's pretty impressive that it lasted so long."" In a statement, Future Publishing said they were consulting with the four staff members on PC Zone. ""The team have done a great job in producing a quality magazine over the years, so it's been a difficult decision to make this proposal,"" the statement read. ""However, our strategy is to focus on the market leader, PC Gamer, in the PC gaming category."" The last issue of PC Zone is due to go on sale 2 September 2010.",Britain's first ever magazine dedicated to PC gaming is to cease publication after 17 years.
"A judge in Dallas, Texas, agreed to protect the firm's assets and temporarily halt two US lawsuits while bankruptcy proceedings occur in Japan. The firm filed for bankruptcy in Japan in February after losing about $473m (£284m) worth of customers' bitcoins to what it says was a hacking attack. Mt Gox is scheduled to return to court on 1 April to extend the protections. The firm filed for Chapter 15 protection in the US late on Sunday. The filing asks the US bankruptcy court to recognize Mt Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and protect its US assets. 'Massive fraud' And it gives Mt Gox a temporary reprieve against two US lawsuits: one a class-action suit in Chicago filed by an Illinois resident, and another a $75m breach-of-contract case filed in Seattle by Coinlab Inc. At the time of the Mt Gox theft, about 750,000 customer bitcoins were stolen as well as close to 100,000 of Mt Gox's own bitcoins. That amounts to about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. Steven Woodrow, the lawyer leading the Chicago class-action suit, told Judge Harlin Hale that the case was a ""massive fraud"". Mt Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said the firm and its founder, Mark Karpeles, were complying with the terms of the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.",Troubled Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox has won temporary bankruptcy protection in the US.
"The local publisher, Tencent, said the intervention had followed ""a large number of complaints"", but did not detail what they were about. The firm had previously said more than one million players had pre-ordered the title ahead of its 8 August release. The move coincided with reports that the news discussions site Reddit had also been blocked in the country. There has been no official statement about Reddit- and it is not unusual for China to block sites temporarily - but some human rights activists have suggested that such a ban was inevitable. Dragon killing Monster Hunter World requires players to stalk, battle and slay a variety of fantasy beasts, but is far from being the most violent video game. It was originally developed by Japan's Capcom, and is the latest instalment in a long-running series. In Europe it has a Pegi age rating of 16 for moderate gore and mild bad language. Tencent said it had already made changes to the title to make it suitable for the Chinese market, and the local regulators had granted this version a local sales licence in March. Tencent is now offering buyers a full refund if they make a claim before Monday morning. Those who decline can continue to play the game if they have already downloaded it, but they have been warned that there is no guarantee it will continue working when updates are made to the firm's WeGame platform. China has banned dozens of video games in the past - typically for featuring excessive violence, drug-taking or sex. The plots of some titles have also fallen foul of the censors. For example, Battlefield 4 was judged to have smeared the country's image after an expansion featured a rogue Chinese military leader attempting to overthrow the government. But it is very unusual for a game to be outlawed after having already been approved. Tencent's shares closed more than 3.4% below their opening price on Hong Kong's markets. Poisonous play The South China Morning Post newspaper reported that the ban comes in the midst of a hiatus in the issuance of local video game licences, with the Chinese authorities not having approved any titles since late March. This has affected Tencent's ability to make money from another high-profile import: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). The firm has already released two mobile versions of the survival game in China, but has yet to be given permission to sell in-game items within them. Tencent also faced problems last year when its previous bestseller - Honour of Kings - was criticised by the state media for being addictive. One editorial likened the game to ""poison"". The company responded by limiting the amount of time under-18s can play each day.",Monster Hunter World - the blockbuster video game - has been banned by China's censors just days after going on sale.
"ACS:Law and its one solicitor, Andrew Crossley, sent thousands of letters threatening recipients with court action if they did not pay out. Now a judge has ruled that the company may be responsible for wasted costs in the case and ordered a full hearing. Mr Crossley's lawyers declined to comment. The proceedings represent something of a role reversal. Originally the Patents County Court had been asked to hear the cases brought by Mr Crossley's firm. After those collapsed, it was decided that he might be liable for costs. Those could run into thousands of pounds, although that money is likely to be covered by solicitors' insurance. Lawyer's letters ACS:Law had originally teamed-up with a company called MediaCAT, which purported to represent copyright owners, such as film and music producers. Together they sent letters to around 10,000 people in the UK, alleging that the IP addresses of their computers had been linked to illegal file sharing. Individuals were given the option of paying £500 or facing court action. Many of those contacted said they had never engaged in such activity and accused ACS:Law of carrying out a speculative ""fishing"" exercise. Mr Crossley eventually brought 26 cases to court, but soon after hearings began he tried to have them dismissed, claiming he had been attacked and received death threats. Judge Colin Birss QC refused to allow proceedings to stop and accused Mr Crossley of trying to ""to avoid judicial scrutiny"". Soon after, both ACS:Law and MediaCAT were wound-up. Profit share It emerged in court that the two companies had agreed on a profit-sharing model, with ACS:Law receiving 65% of any money recovered. In his most recent ruling, Mr Birss said that arrangement had ""brought the legal profession into disrepute"". He also branded the now-defunct firm ""amateurish and slipshod"". The court's decision to press ahead with a hearing on wasted costs was welcomed by lawyers representing those people who received ACS:Law letters. Michael Forrester, from Ralli Solicitors, said his firm was also planning to pursue claims for harassment against Mr Crossley and urged anyone who was affected to join the action. ""It can be incredibly upsetting for people to receive these letters and they may well have a claim in harassment, so I am urging them to come forward."" Mr Crossley's application for permission to appeal was refused. He is also being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.",A controversial law firm that tried to get money from computer users by accusing them of illegal file sharing could be hit with massive legal fees.
"The web giant fired the three, along with a fourth person who was not arrested. Baidu's spokeswoman, Betty Tian, said the sums involved amounted to ""tens of thousands of yuan"" (thousands of pounds). It is not known what posts were deleted. ""Baidu has always firmly cracked down on the illegal behaviour of online posts deletion for payment,"" Ms Tian wrote in an email to the BBC. ""Baidu has also proactively reported actions involving illegal behaviour to the public security organs. ""We have established that we will not accept any payment in handling online user complaints. ""Baidu has continuously provided professional ethics education to staff members who are given authority to delete online posts."" Illegal agencies Baidu, as well as other Chinese web companies and foreign websites aiming to operate in China, has to comply with the country's strict internet regulations. Known as The Great Firewall, the system bans a number of foreign web services in the communist nation and imposes strict censorship and self-censorship rules. There are a number of illegal agencies in China that promise to delete controversial or negative online content on behalf of companies or individuals. To deal with unwanted web posts legally, companies such as US-based Reputation.com specialise in creating positive content, which is meant to come up higher in the search results.","Three employees of China's main search engine, Baidu, have been arrested on suspicion of having accepted bribes to delete posts from its forum service."
"The allegations were made by Qihoo, a well-known cyber-security firm based in Beijing. The company said it had found evidence in malware suggesting the CIA had targeted airlines, petrol companies and government agencies. The BBC has contacted the CIA for comment. Qihoo said it had analysed malicious code and found similarities between it and information about alleged CIA hacking tools which was published three years ago. Among other alleged targets of the hacking campaign were internet firms, scientific institutions and energy companies. ""We speculate that in the past 11 years of infiltration attacks, CIA may have already grasped the most classified business information of China, even of many other countries in the world,"" added Qihoo. In recent years, we have become used to private cyber-security companies, and then Western governments, calling out espionage by other states - with China often in the firing line. Many private cyber-security companies, though, are still wary of publicly linking a particular hacking group to a foreign state. This new report is a sign that Chinese companies are willing to hit back at the US and the CIA. One thing making it easier for them is the fact that the CIA lost control of some of its most sensitive hacking tools, which were leaked onto the web. That allowed others to recognise them being used by the CIA - or, perhaps, by people using them to falsely implicate the US. At times, reports by US cyber-security companies appear to have dovetailed with US policy. The same might be true in this case, as China seeks to push back. China has urged the US to give a clear explanation of any hacking activities, and make cyber-space peaceful and safe. In March 2017, a trove of documents was published by WikiLeaks, that appeared to reveal a number of CIA hacking tools. The documents suggested the agency had developed ways of eavesdropping on smartphones and smart devices with built-in microphones. ""It is already known that the US has an offensive cyber-capability,"" said James Sullivan at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. ""Whether this particular example is true or not, it still raises questions about the ethics of offensive cyber and the licence to operate.""","The Chinese Foreign Ministry has asked the US for a ""clear explanation"" after claims the CIA had been hacking targets in China for at least 11 years."
"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News If he were to spot an enemy down there, or anywhere near the aircraft, he would not need to point the plane towards the target. He would simply look at it - through the solid hull of the plane - make sure that a tiny symbol displayed on his helmet's visor was aligned with the object, press a button and fire. The pilot is wearing BAE Systems' Striker HMSS helmet, the UK defence company's latest development. Putting augmented reality technology - as used in video games - to military use is the latest goal for helmet makers around the world. Cameras all around the aircraft are wirelessly linked to BAE's helmet; the system checks in which direction the pilot is looking, and then displays the exact view on the visor, in real time. Striker incorporates a helmet-mounted display (HMD), designed to help the pilot communicate with the plane. HMD is a step forward from the so-called head-up displays (HUD) - the transparent screens in front of the pilot that first appeared in the 1970s. They show key data, such as the altitude, speed and direction, allowing pilots to keep their eyes on the view ahead instead of constantly looking down to check their instruments. HUDs also display targets - but to aim, the pilot has to manoeuvre the aircraft accordingly. The military around the world started using HMDs in the 1990s; nowadays, they are becoming more and more advanced. ""If a pilot wears a Striker helmet - which is essentially a helmet with an integrated display - when he sees something on the ground he can just turn his head, put a symbol across on to the point of interest, press a button, and the system will calculate the object's co-ordinates,"" says Alan Jowett of BAE Systems. ""The aircraft can then turn its sensors, cameras or weapons in that direction - so it allows a dialogue directly between the plane and the pilot."" Night vision Pilots from a number of countries routinely wear Striker HMSS on training exercises but it has not yet been used in combat. BAE Systems says its helmet is the most advanced in the world but there are other companies which can make a claim to that title. California-based Vision Systems International (VSI) has created a helmet-mounted display called HMDS Gen II, specifically designed for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter stealth jet, which is currently under development. The plane has been designed without a head-up display, so getting the right HMD is paramount. Like Striker, HMDS Gen II integrates infrared imaging, night vision and a virtual HUD, showing data right in front of the pilot's eyes. ""All of the plane's sensors along with a set of cameras mounted on the jet's outer surfaces feed the system, providing the pilot with X-ray vision-like imagery,"" says David Cenciotti, a military aviation journalist and former Italian Air Force officer. ""He can see in all directions, and through any surface, with all the information needed to fly the plane and to cue weapons projected on to the visor."" ""The most used helmet-mounted display in the world is JHMCS, also made by VSI."" Playing the game In future, full-display helmets could lead to the deployment of unmanned drones from the sky, says Peter Robbie, vice-president of business development at European aerospace and defence firm EADS. ""If you're flying a fighter plane with a helmet-mounted display, you could actually control a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] equipped with weapons from the jet,"" he says. ""The UAV would be an additional weapons carrier, and the pilot could pass targeting information to it. ""So if he sees a target, by pressing a button it would become the unmanned vehicle's target. The pilot could authorise it to drop a missile and then monitor through his helmet where it is going to go. ""This type of monitoring already happens now - the pilot has a laser pointed on to the target, and it is what the weapon goes after. If at the last minute he sees, for instance, an ambulance turn up, he can make the weapon miss the target."" Such developments, along with the pinpoint accuracy of missiles on a modern aeroplane, could help save lives by reducing collateral damage. But one retired RAF pilot says that adopting too much technology worries him. ""The biggest computer in my day, in the 1970s and 1980s, was the human brain. Now the human brain is in the business of managing all the data the plane is feeding to it,"" says Andrew Brookes, a former wing commander. ""You're not flying - the computer does the flying. You just sit in an armchair, so to speak, and manage the battle space, manage all the inputs that are coming around from miles away, and a lot of it is fused under the screen in the helmet in front of your eyes. ""And while the precision power is awesome, and the intelligence-gathering capability is awesome, you become an all-seeing being in the sky. ""That's frightening when you think about it - as everything becomes more technological, there's less and less of the human flying element, and some people may not realise they are making a transition from a video game in their living room to a big video game in a conflict. ""And in real life, there is simply no reset button.""","When a pilot in a Eurofighter Typhoon jet glances down, he doesn't see a steel-grey floor. Instead he sees clouds, and maybe sheep and cows in green fields below."

"The annual home broadband report says the average home speed is now 64 megabits per second (Mbps), up from 54.2Mbps the year before. The 18% boost is in line with growth in previous years. Data for the report was gathered in November 2019, but updated with changes during the coronavirus lockdown, when speeds fell by 2%. Ofcom says the small decrease shows that performance ""is holding up well"" during the pandemic, despite the increased demand. The government began to ask people to stay at home on 16 March, so the speeds from the last week of March were compared to the beginning of the month. Virgin Media was the worst affected, with speed dipping by nearly 10% at one point - although the report noted that since Virgin has higher speeds than most providers, customers were unlikely to have noticed. The Ofcom report is compiled from a panel of volunteers who have the speeds measured from their routers, and is considered to be a very accurate way of measuring the data. Superfast connections The main body of the report, which covers the data from 2019, found that nearly three-quarters of UK homes have what Ofcom considers ""superfast"" broadband packages of 30Mpbs or higher. Real-world connection speeds are slightly lower, with 69% of people achieving 30Mbps or more. That includes the 17% of homes on 100Mbps or higher, and 3% achieve more than 300Mbps. On the lower end, 13% of homes are still on connections of 10mbps or less, and another 18% have speeds between 10-30mbps. Those numbers all refer to the proportion of people who are actually getting those speeds - not how widely available they are. The speeds and packages available to homes still depend on their physical address. Rural broadband, for example, broadly remains slower than the same technology in urban areas. Old-style ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over copper wire, for example, are 36% higher in cities than outside them. But the gap between rural and urban connections is narrowing, the report found. Ofcom also launched a separate report on the same day on broadband availability - what is offered to homes, rather than what speeds are actually achieved. Full-fibre broadband is up by a fifth since last year, but is still only accessible to 12% of homes. Ultrafast broadband availability (300mpbs or higher) crept upward by 2% to 55% of households.","The average broadband speed in the UK rose by 18% last year, regulator Ofcom says."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Putting a chip under your skin is not so very different from getting a piercing or tattoo, argued one of the panellists - except there was often less blood. For some, transhumanism - the theory that the human race can evolve beyond its physical and mental limitations with the help of technology - is a crucial part of the advancement of society. Bio-hacker Lepht Anonym has nine implants and strongly believes what she does will benefit humankind as well as her own curiosity. But she admits it can be painful. ""The magnets in my fingers really, really hurt. They hurt so much that your vision goes white for a bit. Really, really painful."" The magnets allow her to sense electromagnetic radiation so she can tell if a device is on or off, whether a microwave is running and identify where power lines are. All of which, she admits, is ""not hugely useful"". She also has a chip under her skin that lets her interact with her phone and unlock doors. She hopes that the ""primitive results"" she has achieved can be used by other, more skilled people, to build something better. ""The bio-hacking community is a co-operative. It is about improving the quality of life for people but in a practical way."" Hygiene issues Not everyone is a fan of the trend. Andreas Sjostrom, who leads CapGemini's global mobility practice, had an implant in 2015 which allowed him to download his customer number from airline tickets and get through security gates with a swipe of his hand. It got him noticed by security staff at the airport and worked but he has since become more cynical about the technology. ""In order for this to be widely used or adopted it has to improve on the current situation,"" he said. ""The hardware that reads such chips is designed for a flat surface such as you'd find in a card,"" he explained, adding that chips in hands are often not recognised by the readers. ""And, if everyone is pressing their hands on the reader, that is less hygienic."" It is estimated that more than 10,000 people around the world have chip implants in their bodies, making it far from mainstream but clearly a growing trend. The current range of implants includes magnets that are installed into fingertips, radio frequency identification chips (RFiD) implanted in hands, and even LED lights that can shine beneath the skin. Chips used for opening doors carry a unique serial number the can be read by a device attached to whatever you want to open and one chip can carry multiple numbers meaning you do not need a separate chip for everything you want to access. Amal Graafstra provides such implants via his firm Dangerous Things and thinks there are three good reasons to have an implant. ""We all carry with us keys, wallet and phone. These are major burdens, they are so important for modern life but everyone hates carrying them. ""With a simple implant that uses less energy and carries less risk than an ear-piercing, you can replace them."" He is able to access not only his house but his car via the implant under his skin, although he admits that getting the device to work with his car required ""a bit of hacking"". But he envisions a future where chips can do far more - and that, he predicts, will attract more people to the community of bio-hacking. ""If someone could use an implant to get on the train, buy coffee, secure their computer, secure their data, get into their house, drive a car - all of these possible applications will compel a lot more adoption."" For Matt Eagles, the implant he has in his brain is not a luxury so much as a necessity to cope with the Parkinson's disease he has had since he was a child. He has two 15cm electrodes that run deep into his brain and create two bumps on his head which he affectionately refers to as ""baby giraffe horns"". The implants are attached to a pulse generator in his chest, which disrupts the electrical signals to his brain and allows him to walk. ""They have given me back my dignity. When you struggle to turn over in bed at night or can't get out of bed to go to the bathroom, to be suddenly able to do so is a huge plus."" It has also given him back confidence to pursue his love of photography - he was an accredited football photographer at the 2012 Olympics - and, perhaps most importantly, he has got married. Many regard medicine as being the real mainstream application for bio-hacking, from cochlear implants which improve hearing loss to smart pills that can be ingested and access, analyse and manipulate bodily functions. Some bio-hackers are ready to go one step further. In October 2017, Josiah Zayner, who has a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Chicago, injected his arm with DNA from a gene-editing tool called Crispr. It is a stunt that he has since said he regrets but his attempt to edit his own genes - in this case to trigger a genetic change in his cells to increase muscle mass - made headlines at the time, largely around the ethics of such experimentation. ""There is a continuum between therapy and enhancement and it is difficult to draw the line between where medicine ends and enhancement begins,"" said Prof John Harris, an ethicist from the University of Manchester. ""As for gene editing the tools are available and relatively cheap and easy to use, but people would be extremely ill-advised to try it."" There has also been objections on religious grounds from some, with Mr Sjostrom receiving negative feedback from a group in the Christian community. ""They see implantable technology and assume the end of times are here and that it is the mark of the beast. It is important to know how to deal with this technology from a theological point of view.""","At a trendy east London bar, a group of body hackers are putting forward their reasons for human augmentation to a packed audience of mainly under-35s, many of whom are sporting piercings and tattoos."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The Maker movement - which encompasses traditional handicrafts through to cutting-edge robotics, is growing exponentially around the world with spin-off Maker Faires popping up all over the globe. Maker Faire Africa is now independent and this year's promises to be the biggest and best yet. ""Our inventions have largely stayed hidden in the 'punk of the bush' and the outer reaches of the informal sector until now,"" reads the introduction on its website. The falling price and availability of off-the-shelf electronics have put low-cost tech innovations centre stage at such events but it is in Africa where many people see home-made inventions having a real impact on people's lives. ""While western fairs are creative they are aimed at hobbyists, whereas in Africa it is more about practical need,"" said Erik Hersman, the man behind the global phenomenon of crowdsourcing crisis-mapping platform Ushahidi. ""The future of Africa is in innovative engineering."" He is also one of the founders and organisers of the Maker Faire Africa, describing it affectionately as ""loosely controlled chaos"". He talked the BBC through some of his favourite things on show in Lagos. FARMING TOOL Many of Africa's greatest innovators are those who see a need for a particular machine and set about making one, often ploughing years of their lives into perfecting them. Pairing engineering know-how with the needs of farming is a powerful combination in Africa and no-one exemplifies this better than 65-year-old engineer Sulaiman Famro who went to the US to complete his graduate education in the 1970s and then returned to Nigeria. There he has created the Farmking - basically a portable processing plant for root crops and grains. He spent his own money and time on perfecting it and the first prototype was completed three years ago. It has a diesel-powered engine that allows for remote processing, with power connections for lighting so that it can work all night, if needed. It can process core crops such as cassava, soya beans, maize, sweet potatoes, yam and many other roots and grains. One of the more interesting uses for it is the capture of starch. The traditional method of processing cassava allows starch to seep into the ground, which is, says Mr Famro, very wasteful. He claims he can save the country $1bn a year, just in savings on starch importation and is currently lobbying governors of different Nigerian states to get the Farmking into their areas. HYDRAULIC TOYS 15-year-old Odo Gerald has been wowing audiences at this year's fair. His biggest fans are small boys, fascinated by the moving toys he has made entirely out of scrap materials. Odo has made four toys over the last four months, including a dump truck, excavator and a helicopter. Using painted plywood, syringes, wire, water and small tubes along with a motorcycle battery to run it all, the miniature machinery packs some cunning hydraulic action. The toys started off as a school project but quickly outgrew what his teachers expected. His next big project is to make a small helicopter that he can get off the ground. This year the fair is specifically reaching out to the youth audience with two tents on site aimed at giving children the chance to play and create. On hand is robotic Lego and electronic kits such as Littlebits, a kit of circuits that snap together with magnets and allow users to incorporate light, sound and movement. For older children there are Arduino microprocessors and a 3D printer to play around with. TUK-TUK LIMO Much of the Maker Faire Africa is about mashing up things that already exist to create something new, better and more usable. Ibrahim Adekunle and Shola Omoniyi have been attracting a crowd with their new take on a stretch limo. The Tricycle Limo can hold up to 12 people, plus driver while a smaller Tricycle Jeep can hold five people, plus driver. Both vehicles cost between 100,000-200,000 naira ($600-$1,200; £375-£750) to rent for the day, and are often on call for weddings, carnivals and other events. The Tricycle Limo cost about 1.5m naira ($9,500; £5,900) to make, and about two weeks to put together. As it is long - about 5m (16ft) - the chassis is strengthened using a long piece of pipe. The jeep version uses a tuk-tuk chassis (a motorised rickshaw) and a two-cylinder engine from a vehicle. The front grill can hold 100kg (220lb) of weight, meaning it can be used for carrying bags of rice, jerry cans of water, or for mounting speakers on at events. The invention is simple but for Mr Hersman, it represents how youngsters can use their own making skills to become entrepreneurs. ""For a lot of young men it is hard to find a job and these two are doing this both for fun and to make it into a business,"" he said. RECYCLING BIKE Modified bicycles have been making the rounds of Lagos cleaning up and recycling five tonnes of rubbish since August. Wecyclers.com is the brainchild of Billikiss Abiola, from Nigeria and Jonathan Kola, from Kenya who together came up with the simple plan to get people in Lagos to recycle aluminium and plastic. The bicycles are welded to a trailer, making a tricycle that can carry large bags of sorted waste. Each bike costs approximately $500 (£300) to build, though those prices will come down as they start making more. The project has gained the attention of the Lagos Waste Management Authority. While the basic idea is low-cost, behind it lies in a database which records all the waste people have recycled and scores them based on the amount and type of recycled stuff. Those involved in the scheme are sent a text to let them know how they are doing and every three months there is an event where people can redeem their points for real goods. The people with the most points also get prizes. The two founders have also tied up with large firms, such as Coca-Cola, which sponsors the prizes and pays for the costs of the event, giving out items like raincoats, backpacks, pens, notebooks and water bottles.","People from the tiniest African villages to some of its largest cities have converged on Lagos, Nigeria, this week to talk about making stuff."
"Combining image recognition and artificial intelligence, the system would be able to distinguish between drunk and sober pictures. It would ask: ""Are you sure you want your boss and your mother to see this?"" The plan was revealed by the head of Facebook's artificial intelligence research lab. Speaking to Wired magazine, Yann LeCun said he wanted to build a Facebook digital assistant. In the future, this assistant might also be able to help identify when someone else has uploaded a picture of a user without permission, he said. Facebook already uses image recognition technology to help identify faces and allow users to tag them correctly. Controversial Increasingly the firm is using the technology in conjunction with artificial intelligence software. AI is already being used to examine overall Facebook behaviour in order to identify the right content for news feeds, Mr LeCun told Wired. The next stage will be to analyse text in posted statuses and automatically suggest relevant hashtags. He also spoke about a future where an intelligent digital assistant could ""mediate your interaction with your friends"". Such a future is likely to prove controversial, with both consumers and privacy advocates who will demand that such services are opt-in rather than offered as a default. Many big tech firms are experimenting with AI. Google has its own AI labs and has been investing heavily in AI and robotics firms.",Facebook is working on software that could prevent users posting unflattering photos of themselves.
"The six-wheeled robots from Starship Technologies will be used to collect parcels rather than deliver them. The project follows a pilot scheme in Germany in which the robots delivered parcels to several suburbs in the city of Hamburg. But one expert suggested there might be a backlash if the facility became commonplace. ""At the moment, in big cities, it can be hard to walk down the street because of the number of people,"" commented Prof Andy Miah, from the University of Salford's School of Environment and Life Sciences. ""In time, it could be the robots we are trying to dodge. I'm not sure that would be a better world."" Starship Technologies' machines are already used by Just Eat for food deliveries in parts of London. They are 55cm (22in) tall and 70cm (28in) long. They weigh 18kg (40lb), and can travel at up to 4mph (6.4km/h). Hermes is only using the robots within a two-mile radius of its control centres, in a limited number of 30-minute collection slots to see how they cope with tight turnarounds. Each robot will be able to carry a maximum of 10kg in cargo in a secure compartment, which customers can access using a code sent to their smartphones. Smooth ride The self-driving robots are thought to have several advantages over aerial drones, from being able to carry heavier payloads to being less likely to fall foul of aviation laws. ""In the sky, we still have to figure out what a drone highway would look like and figure out some sophisticated collision-avoidance technology,"" noted Prof Miah. By contrast, Starship's ground-based robots will be kept under close supervision by human operators. Each supervisor will watch over three robots via their on-board cameras and take control of road-crossings and other challenging situations. In time, however, Starship says one operator should be able to control up to 100 robots, which would make its operation more cost effective.",Courier company Hermes has announced a trial of self-driving robots in the London borough of Southwark.
"By Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News That is the name of the virtual crypto-currency I created to see how easy it is to leap on the virtual cash bandwagon. That bandwagon briefly propelled each Bitcoin, the best known crypto-currency, to be worth about $1,200 (£715). Currently each virtual coin trades for much less than half of the value of that November 2013 peak. It is a bandwagon that others, notably Litecoin and Dogecoin, have jumped on to as well. More are leaping aboard every day according to figures gathered by crypto-cash tracking site Cryptsy which currently lists more than 170 virtual currencies. ""Most of the new crypto-currencies which have come into existence since the advent of Bitcoin are basically Bitcoin-duplicates with a different brand name,"" says economic historian Garrick Hileman from the London School of Economics. ""Because Bitcoin is open source anyone is free to 'copy and paste' Bitcoin's core software protocol to create a new crypto-currency."" Many of those newer virtual currencies have sought to outdo Bitcoin by sharpening up the computer code behind the currency to avoid some of the technical troubles that dog the market leader, he says. BBC bucks Talking about alternative crypto-currencies, which are known as alt-coins, made me wonder how easy it is to create one. Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers, told me; ""It is trivial to create your own currency. It doesn't really take much programming skill, even."" Mr Garzik pointed me towards Matt Corallo who is behind the Coingen.io website that makes it very straightforward to roll your own money. The first step was to get hold of some Bitcoins to pay the small fee Mr Corallo charges for a copy of the coin-generating software. This proved a hurdle because it is difficult to buy Bitcoins quickly. I was keen to put a layer of security between me and whoever I bought them from so ended up using the Barclays Pingit app on a smartphone to buy coins via the BitBargain website. With Bitcoins safely in my digital wallet I transferred a few to Mr Corallo and, like many hundreds of others, filled in the form that defined how my coin, now dubbed Beebcoins, would work. I decided there would be a maximum of 21 million Beebcoins, picked an abbreviation (BBC), uploaded a logo and made some choices about the technical innards of the Beebcoin system. The next step was to install the software on several computers and then get them talking to each other to form the little network needed to mine the coins. Crypto-currencies are inherently community-based and I happen to have enough computers at home, seven at the last count, to form that community and get mining. Coingen provides precious little in terms of support so I scoured the web for help and found a checklist to run through to get the network humming. I typed commands into the command line, helped the machines see each other and connect on my home network and got each one doing the complicated maths to generate coins. Within 20 minutes the first message popped up telling me some coins had been mined. Sadly, that did not mean I could spend or share them straight away. Instead the Beebcoins had to ""mature"" - this meant that any computer had to complete a lot more mining work before it was rewarded. There is no free lunch with an alt-coin. In total, it took the machines I used more than six hours running at full speed to complete the work needed to get those coins to mature. I now have thousands of the things. I wonder what I've spent in electricity to do all that work? It struck me then that if I wanted to turn Beebcoins into an actual currency it would take much more than just computers. It would require a marketing job to get people to value the coin and back it with more computers or even real cash. Also needed would be people with far better web-programming skills than mine to add a friendlier layer to that virtual cash-generating system. The sheer hard work involved in getting beyond the basics was exposed by tech news site Ars Technica which created its own crypto-currency - Ars Coins. It recruited a few developers to help and even so hit real problems when it rolled out the currency to readers. Solving them and then getting people to buy in was hard. Even then the only reward it could offer Ars Coin miners was special icons on messages they post to the magazine's discussion forums. For me the Beebcoin experience has given me a greater understanding of how crypto-currencies work and why some of them fail and others succeed. The value of these virtual currencies lies, like the real things, in what people are willing to pay for them. That's perhaps why so many of these alt-coins revolve around an online community as people are already invested in that group and have a ready need to reward the good behaviour of other members. At the moment, Beebcoins have zero monetary value unless there is someone out there that wants to take the network off my hands. One careful owner. All offers considered. Going cheap.","I am the richest person in the world but, sadly, only when it comes to Beebcoins."
"SoftBank, the company behind the robot, is planning to release 1,000 robots every month. Pepper will sell for 198,000 yen (£1,000), and businesses will be able to rent it for 1,500 yen an hour. Robotic expert Prof Noel Sharkey said SoftBank's business strategy was ""risky"". Although the upfront price is relatively cheap for a sophisticated robot - SoftBank is actually selling it at below manufacturing costs - customers will also have to pay monthly service fees of up to 24,000 yen and sign up to a three-year contract. ""SoftBank is hoping to make money from apps, but it is risky as it is not clear whether anyone will develop any for it,"" said Prof Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield. There will be 100 apps available for download at launch. The robots will be manufactured by FoxConn. Chinese online retailer Alibaba is also partnering. Both are investing $118m in SoftBank's robotic division and will take 20% shares in the company. Over-hyped No date has yet been set for when Pepper will go on sale outside of Japan, but Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son said it would probably happen next year. Pepper can remember faces and is programmed to recognise human emotions. ""It looks excellent, and I think that it is good at conveying human-like gestures - but the way it detects human emotions might be over-hyped,"" said Prof Sharkey. ""I think that they are over-claiming on its speech functions, too. The conversations are very one-sided, and it asks a lot of questions,"" he added. Featuring more than 20 motors and highly articulated arms, Pepper is being touted as a household robot, assisting elderly people or for use in a family. But Prof Sharkey is not convinced it will be a hit with consumers. ""There is talk of it being an assistant, but it can't lift anything, so it is really a very limited companion,"" he said. Japan has a rising elderly population, and the government is keen to use technology to help ease its overburdened healthcare system. But the use of robotic assistants has not always gone well, according to Prof Sharkey. ""There is a big fuss when these things are launched in Japanese care homes, but go back after a year and they are in a cupboard,"" he said.","Pepper, the humanoid robot that its makers say can recognise and respond to human emotions, goes on sale in Japan this weekend."
"Named Emotive, it works by accessing the emotional content of postings on the social networking site. The team, from Loughborough University, say it can scan up to 2,000 tweets a second and rate them for expressions of one of eight human emotions. They claim Emotive could help calm civil unrest and identify early threats to public safety. More than 500 million people across the world use Twitter, and more than 340 million tweets are posted daily. The team, from the university's new Centre for Information Management, say the system can extract a direct expression of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, shame and confusion from each tweet. The academics said that using the Emotive software to geographically evaluate any mass mood could help police to track potential criminal behaviour or threats to public safety. It may be able to guide national policy on the best way to react to major incidents, they added. 'Sadness and disgust' Prof Tom Jackson, who led the research team, said that public postings through social media gave a very accurate real-time record of how and what people were feeling. ""Following the murder of solider Lee Rigby in Woolwich there was an outpouring of sadness and disgust through Twitter,"" he said. ""Across the country people expressed their emotions at this unprovoked attack, with some using the incident to incite racial hatred against Muslims. ""Two days after his murder his family appealed for calm, stating that their son would not have wanted his name to be used as an excuse to carry out attacks against others. ""This appeal had an almost immediate effect, leading to an outpour of positive sentiment."" Prof Jackson added: ""Twitter is a very concise platform through which users express how they feel about a particular event, be that a criminal act, a new government policy or even a change in the weather. ""Through the computer program we have created we can collate these expressions of feelings in real time, map them geographically and track how they develop."" Dr Ann O'Brien, who was part of the team that created the study for emotions used by the programme, said it could chart the strength of feeling expressed in both ordinary language and in slang. ""For any incident we can view how reactions grow and diminish over time,"" she said. The system is currently only being used to analyse tweets in the UK, but the researchers said it could easily be scaled up to monitor tweets globally.",British scientists have developed a computer program they say can map the mood of the nation using Twitter.
"South Korea's radio management agency has issued guidelines outlawing the sale of unregistered selfie sticks. The law applies to sticks using Bluetooth to remotely trigger a phone to take a picture. The agency said unregistered sticks might interfere with other devices using the same radio frequencies. Selfie sticks into which smartphones can be slotted to take snaps of their owners beyond arm's length have proved hugely popular and the most sophisticated versions use the Bluetooth short-range radio technology to trigger a handset's shutter. Because they use Bluetooth, the devices are considered to be a ""telecommunication device"" and must be tested and registered with the South Korean agency that oversees such gadgets, an official at the Central Radio Management Office told the AFP newswire. ""The announcement last Friday was really just to let people know that they need to be careful about what they sell,"" said the official. The regulations published by the Office can impose fines or jail terms on those making and selling unregistered sticks. ""We've had a lot of calls from vendors who think they might have been unknowingly selling uncertified products,"" added the radio management office's spokesman. So far, the new regulations are not being rigorously enforced and there are no reports of the sellers of selfie sticks at attractions in South Korea being targeted by police. Even the official at the radio frequency watchdog wondered if the new regulation was going to make a difference to the sale of the sticks - whether or not they are registered. ""It's not going to affect anything in any meaningful way, but it is nonetheless a telecommunication device subject to regulation, and that means we are obligated to crack down on uncertified ones,"" said the spokesman.","In South Korea, selling a ""selfie stick"" that lets people photograph themselves could mean a fine of up to £17,300 if the gadget is unregistered."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News The new rules, including the controversial Article 13, will hold tech firms responsible for material posted without copyright permission. Sharing memes and GIFs will still be allowed under the new laws. Many musicians and creators say the legislation will compensate artists fairly - but others argue that they will destroy user-generated content. Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. Tech companies have argued that artists are already paid fairly under the current system. Google said it would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"". High-profile figures who have campaigned against the EU Copyright Directive include Wyclef Jean and web inventor Sir Tim Berners Lee, while Debbie Harry and Sir Paul McCartney have been among its supporters. It has taken several revisions for the current legislation, which was was backed by 348 MEPs, with 274 against, to reach its final form. It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published. The two clauses causing the most controversy are known as Article 11 and Article 13. It means they would need to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. Article 13 does not include cloud storage services and there are already existing exemptions, including parody, which, for example, includes memes. Memes 'excluded' It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral - since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would have made it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law made earlier this year made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". The European Parliament said that memes would be ""specifically excluded"" from the directive, although it was unclear how tech firms would be able to enforce that rule with a blanket filter. MEP for London Mary Honeyball said: ""There's no problem with memes at all. This directive was never intended to stop memes and mashups. ""I think that's doom-mongering. People who carry out their business properly have nothing to worry about at all."" 'Massive blow' Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, which collects royalties for music artists, welcomed the directive as ""a massive step forward"" for consumers and creatives. ""It's about making sure that ordinary people can upload videos and music to platforms like YouTube without being held liable for copyright - that responsibility will henceforth be transferred to the platforms,"" he said. However the campaign group Open Knowledge International described it as ""a massive blow"" for the internet. ""We now risk the creation of a more closed society at the very time we should be using digital advances to build a more open world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few,"" said chief executive Catherine Stihler. Google said that while the latest version of the directive was improved, there remained ""legal uncertainty"". ""The details matter and we look forward to working with policy-makers, publishers, creators and rights holders, as EU member states move to implement these new rules,"" it said. Kathy Berry, senior lawyer at Linklaters, said more detail was required about how Article 13 would be enforced. ""While Article 13 may have noble aims, in its current form it functions as little more than a set of ideals, with very little guidance on exactly which service providers will be caught by it or what steps will be sufficient to comply,"" she said. European Parliament Rapporteur Axel Voss said the legislation was designed to protect people's livelihoods. ""This directive is an important step towards correcting a situation which has allowed a few companies to earn huge sums of money without properly remunerating the thousands of creatives and journalists whose work they depend on,"" he said. ""It helps make the internet ready for the future, a space which benefits everyone, not only a powerful few.""",Copyright laws which critics say could change the internet have been voted in by the European Parliament.
"By Matthew WallTechnology reporter, BBC News By 2019, 70% of train passengers should have access to the faster technology, the Department for Transport added. Passengers may be able to watch streamed videos on their mobiles, for example, if the plan to raise data capacity per train 25-fold succeeds. The programme will be industry funded. ""Today's announcement marks the beginning of the end of poor coverage on our railways,"" Mr McLoughlin said. A Network Rail spokesman added: ""As an industry, we recognise that the limited availability of mobile communications on Britain's rail network is not good enough. ""If rail is to remain a preferred mode of transport, this must be addressed, which is why today's announcement is good news for the millions of people who travel by train each day."" Spare capacity Network Rail is in the middle of a £1.9bn digital communications improvement programme that is upgrading both its fixed line and mobile infrastructure. A new fibre optic network should be capable of handling up to 192,000 gigabit per second (Gbit/s) of data once the upgrade is complete in June 2014. The Rail Safety and Standards Board has forecast that the telecommunications demand on Britain's railways could rise to 200Gbit/s by 2018, which would still leave plenty of spare capacity on the upgraded system. ""By increasing the number of mobile phone masts to fill gaps in signal coverage, and incorporating signal boosters inside train carriages, passengers will be able to benefit from our surplus data capacity,"" a Network Rail spokesman told the BBC. Currently, train operating companies limit what kinds of material can be downloaded on to mobile devices because each vehicle only has access to 2.5 megabit per second (Mbit/s) of data which must be shared among its passengers. As a result the firms block access to video streaming services such as iPlayer and Netflix. However, this could rise to 50Mbit/s per train after the upgrade, Network Rail said, allowing a change of policy. The commercial details of how Network Rail, the mobile phone operators and train operating companies would pay for the additional upgrades, and how much passengers would be charged for high-speed mobile broadband, have yet to be thrashed out.","The rail industry plans to roll out ""high-speed mobile broadband"" across the busiest parts of Britain's rail network, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has announced."
"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The BBA said there were 66 robberies in 2011, compared to 847 in 1992. The drop has been attributed to a raft of innovative technologies making it extremely difficult for ""traditional"" robbery tactics to work. ""Banks are working hard to confine armed robberies to the world of TV dramas,"" BBA chief Anthony Browne said. ""Being caught up in a bank job is a terrifying ordeal for staff and customers that can scar lives for decades. ""It's great to see that the number of these crimes have fallen sharply in recent years. Anyone trying to rob a bank now faces much better CCTV, protective screens that can rise in less than a second and even special fog designed to disperse criminals. ""Banks will continue to work closely with each other, post offices and the police to make such raids a thing of the past."" Disorientating fog A similar trend has been noted in the US, where FBI figures for 2012 put the number of bank robberies nationwide at 3,870 - the lowest in decades. In an effort to deter criminals and make branch workers safer, banks have made significant investments in security technology. These range from simple barriers - which drop down when a panic button is pressed - to special ""fog"" that disorientates criminals. ""DNA"" spray is another common deterrent - robbers are coated with a unique, traceable material that is extremely difficult to wash off skin and can prove that a suspect was at the premises of a robbery. Combined, the measures mean the risks outweigh any potential gains - particularly as bank branches typically store less cash on the premises than in previous years. Shift to online However, while brute-force bank robberies are dropping, banks - and their customers - are still under threat from crime. Official statistics from the Met Police confirm that business robberies were down 31% in London over the past decade, reports the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam, but some thieves have switched their focus to the vehicles that transport money between banks. More significant is the growing rate of cyber-crime relating to banks and other financial transactions. Recently, 40 million credit card details held by major US retail chain Target were compromised and are now being sold online. The attack, according to one security researcher, originated in Ukraine. In a separate attack, criminals based in New York obtained $45m (£29m) by accessing a database of information used by cash machines. Seven men were charged in May. Beyond bank details, hackers - the new generation of robbers - are also scooping up personal details and packaging them up to be sold on. Full dossiers of information about an individual, including bank details, are routinely sold on the online black market for around $30, a recent study suggested.

"By Rob CrossleyVideo games writer It will be the first title offered on the ""next-gen"" PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles - and if the trailer is anything to go by there's little doubt it will display the game's gruesome attacks in greater detail than ever before, causing fresh fuss. Even so, it will prove difficult to trigger the scale of outrage that accompanied the original game. In the summer of 1993, the Nintendo executive Howard Lincoln had come up with a controversial solution to an unavoidable problem. His company, renowned for creating entertainment that is cherished by children and trusted by parents, was preparing to release Mortal Kombat, considered one of the most violent games ever, on the Super Nintendo console. It was the equivalent of Disney distributing Reservoir Dogs, American Psycho on Sesame Street. Mortal Kombat was admired by critics but inevitably better known for its unashamed glorification of murder. It allowed combatants to rip the heart out of a vanquished foe, or tear the head off a fallen opponent, and hold the appendage up as a trophy. The game encouraged players to do this with the infamous message ""Finish him!"" that would repeatedly flash on the screen when a bout was over. How could a game like this, regardless of how popular it was, be sold on shelves next to Super Mario World? Go green Months after Mortal Kombat's initial release across arcades in October 1992, and before its port onto the Super Nintendo, Mr Lincoln met Acclaim chief executive Gregory Fischbach to offer a solution. ""Lincoln told us we needed to change the blood from red to green, which I thought was pretty stupid,"" Mr Fischbach tells the BBC. Not only that, but the game's fatalities would be edited, and various background details - such as heads impaled on spikes - would be completely removed. Mr Fischbach believes such decisions were rash, but was unable to block them. ""To my mind, Mortal Kombat was comic-book violence, but some people got upset about it. People looked at it as though we were selling it to nine-year-old children."" The wider issue was that Mortal Kombat had arrived during an era of transition for the games industry. What was considered a child's pursuit had begun to serve the interests of young adults and teenagers. Those audience clashes had naturally begun to manifest. ""It was the beginning of video games coming of age,"" says Mr Fischbach. ""At one point in time, games were just meant for children, and nobody really took them seriously. But it was with the launch of Mortal Kombat that people who controlled the media began to look at it differently."" Even though games such as Mortal Kombat, Doom and Night Trap were created for mature audiences, crucially there was no law preventing young people from accessing them. This led to thunderous denunciations from politicians and news media anchors alike. ""Part of the problem at the time was that the biggest distributor of games in the US was Toys R Us. The positioning in the marketplace was that games were designed for children, and not teenagers or young adults."" Blood money Nintendo's efforts to censor Mortal Kombat failed to put a lid on the controversy. Rival company Sega had also published the game on its own system, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in the UK), and via a cheat code allowed gamers to enjoy the gore-fuelled glories of the arcade original. According to Blake Harris, author of Console Wars, Sega's gamble paid off enormously. ""The net result was that the Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat outsold the Super Nintendo version five-to-one,"" he tells the BBC. It was the Genesis version that also caught the eye of one young Mortal Kombat fan who happened to be the son of a Capitol Hill aide. According to Mr Harris, this simple connection is what could have triggered the political outrage against violent video games. ""Bill Andresen, a former chief of staff to Senator Joe Lieberman, was asked by his son to buy Mortal Kombat. But when Andresen saw the game, he showed it to Lieberman, who was appalled by it."" Reform calls On 1 December 1993, Mr Lieberman gathered the Washington press corps to expose what he believed was the corrupting influence of video games on young minds. He played several VHS tapes, showcasing some of the goriest elements of games such as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap, and announced his intention to introduce a game age-ratings body. ""Few parents would buy these games for their kids if they knew what was in them,"" he said at the time. ""We're talking about video games that glorify violence and teach children to enjoy inflicting the most gruesome forms of cruelty imaginable."" John Tobias, one of the four developers who created Mortal Kombat, believed the reaction was harsh. ""Their lobbying never felt sincere. To me it always felt like scapegoating an industry they knew nothing about to pander for votes,"" he tells the BBC. ""Anyone who listened to the testimony or the questioning that went on and who knew anything about games understood that. ""Video games were not and never will be the great destructor of society they were trying to paint them to be."" One week after Mr Lieberman's press conference, the senator chaired a subcommittee on violent video games, insisting that the industry must introduce a system of self-regulation if it wanted to avoid state regulation. Within five months, the games industry established the pioneering Entertainment Software Rating Board, and one of its first acts was to assign Mortal Kombat a ""mature"" rating, meaning it was illegal for minors to purchase it. Moral panic These events, spurred by moral panic, painted the games industry in its most unflattering light, but nevertheless established a ratings code that is still adhered to today. Mortal Kombat 10, announced today, is certain to be the next entry in the series designated an M-rating. On reflection, Mr Fischbach believes the ratings reform ""was the right thing to do"". He says: ""It allowed game creators and publishers to focus on what they do, and allowed information to be displayed on game packaging that wasn't there before."" But Mr Harris believes that, however beneficial the outcome, the calls for game age ratings was not as driven by the public as often suggested. ""I think the outrage was mostly from the media. I think parents, for the most part, still didn't realise what video games were,"" he says. ""I could be wrong, but I spent three years researching this, and not once did I get the sense that people were spurred on by angry calls or angry letters from the parents. ""I mean, Lincoln told me that he got numerous angry letters from parents, but it was people complaining about Nintendo censoring their games. They didn't like the green blood. I think that tells you how much this issue was media-driven.""","Warner Bros has confirmed it plans to release Mortal Kombat X next year, the latest edition in a video game series that has stoked controversy and allured fighting fanatics for more than 20 years."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter So, an experiment under way in a few countries, where the social media giant appears to be making it harder for users to see news stories, has caused something akin to panic. The new feature Facebook is trying out is called Explore. It offers all sorts of stories it thinks might interest you, a separate news feed encouraging you to look further afield than just at what your friends are sharing. Meanwhile, for most people, the standard News Feed remains the usual mixture of baby photos and posts from companies or media organisations whose pages you have liked. Sounds fine, doesn't it? Except that in six countries - Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia, Serbia, Guatemala, and Cambodia - the experiment went further. For users there, the main News Feed was cleared of everything but the usual stuff from your friends and sponsored posts - in other words, if you wanted to have your material seen in the place most users spend their time you had to pay for the privilege. In a Medium post entitled ""Biggest drop in organic reach we've ever seen"", a Slovakian journalist Filip Struharik documented the impact. Publishers in his country were seeing just a quarter of the interactions they used to get before the change, he said. What had become a vital and vibrant platform for them was emptying out fast. Other journalists around the world have looked into the future and hate what they see. Their organisations have become addicted to Facebook as the one true way of reaching audiences and going cold turkey would be very painful. Facebook is of course a business - and a hugely successful one - that makes its money from advertising. So, why would it not want publishers to pay to reach its gigantic audience? But Peter Kafka, a journalist from Recode, tweeted an even more depressing thought: ""Conspiracy angle: fb wants more $ from publishers! More accurate, and dispiriting angle (for publishers): fb doesn't care about publishers."" Facebook responded as it often does by saying calm down, dears, it was just a bit of fun. As the wave of panic rolled around the news media world, the social network's head of newsfeed Adam Mosseri put up a post with the title Clarifying Recent Tests. It explained that the experiment is aimed at understanding whether people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content. ""We currently have no plans to roll this test out further,"" he added. This has not helped much - that word ""currently"" seems to stick out ominously. But at least Facebook has done publishers big and small a service. They knew the risks involved in innovations such as Instant Articles - where their works live on the social network - or Facebook Live - where a broadcaster's brand might be less visible to many users. Now they know that Facebook is at least thinking about a future where news plays a smaller role in the social media experience. Given Facebook's role in last year's US elections, some may think that's a good thing. But for thousands of struggling media organisations that thought they had found a route forward, it is a chilling prospect.",It used to be a tweak in the Google search algorithm that sent a shudder through newsrooms trying to adapt to the online era. Now it is any change in the design of Facebook.
"The service allows users to keep checklists and voice notes, and annotate photos. The digital memo market is a burgeoning one and the offering will put Google head to head with services such as Evernote. Experts predict that Google might have entered the market a little too late. Memory aid services are striking a chord with consumers and employees who are increasingly swamped by information. Current market leader Evernote has 15 million active users. Microsoft has a similar product - OneNote - and there are smaller rivals such as Springpad and Catch. Now it seems Google wants a piece of the action. ""Every day we all see, hear or think of things we need to remember. Usually we grab a pad of sticky notes, scribble a reminder and put it on the desk, the fridge or the relevant page of a magazine,"" said Google software engineer Katherine Kuan in a blog post. Keep is Google's attempt to turn this ad-hoc notetaking into a more efficient digital service. ""With Keep you can quickly jot ideas down when you think of them and even include checklists and photos to keep track of what's important to you,"" she added. The information is stored in Google Drive. Users can also speak memos and Keep transcribes them. And there is a search facility for people to quickly find what they are looking for. Currently Keep is available only via the web or as an app for phones and tablets running Android 4.0 or above. '800lb gorilla' But with little to differentiate it from competitors, some feel Google may struggle to make an impact. ""My gut instinct is that Google may have come too late to this. It has a track record - with cloud services and social networking - of coming too late and struggling to make an impact,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group. ""But, if anyone can make an impact, it will be Google,"" he added. ""If there is a 800lb gorilla like Google behind you you are going to be worried. Evernote cannot rest on its laurels but it does have a huge user base and they are not all going to desert it overnight."" Tony Cripps, analyst at research firm Ovum, thinks Google might benefit from the fact that many already use its myriad services. ""If you are a converted Google user it represents a good option. There is a level of convenience about having access to a range of services using one log-in,"" he said. ""I use Evernote but I'll give this a spin and see if it works for me.""","Anyone who has ever jotted down a note on the back of an envelope and promptly lost it might be interested in Google's latest offering, Keep."
"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter He said the platform ""unfairly"" reduced the visibility of 600,000 accounts, including some members of Congress. But he was unable to immediately say whether a majority of them were Republican, Democratic or otherwise. Mr Dorsey is being questioned by senators over allegations that Twitter censors conservative voices. Several Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, have accused Twitter of bias, which the company denies. ""Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,"" said Mr Dorsey. However, he said the company had made mistakes. On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice said it would investigate ""growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms"". What is the Twitter hearing about? Allegations of censorship were fuelled when Twitter added a ""quality filter"" to the platform and its search results. Some users noticed that their tweets no longer appeared in search results and suggested that their content was being hidden, known as a ""shadow ban"". Mr Dorsey told senators that the platform used ""hundreds of signals"" to decide ""what to show, down-rank and filter"". ""We do not shadow-ban anyone based on political ideology,"" he said. He explained that the algorithm had acted on the behaviour of people following accounts - so some politicians were punished for the behaviour of their followers. ""It was unfair"", said Mr Dorsey. ""We corrected it."" Several senators in the hearing said the investigation was a waste of time. Democrat Paul Sabanes said the hearing had been triggered by ""deep-state conspiracy theories proffered by the president"" while fellow Democrat Jerry McNerney said it was an effort by Republicans to motivate their voters. ""President Trump and many Republicans have peddled conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fundraise,"" said Democrat Frank Pallone. Mr Pallone said Twitter could not be accused of anti-conservative bias while it allowed President Trump to use it for ""juvenile tweets and misinformation"". What else did Mr Dorsey reveal?","Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has told US lawmakers the company's algorithms have not always been ""impartial""."
"The firm's DeepMind division says that it played 100 games against Stockfish 8, and won or drew all of them. The research has yet to be peer reviewed. But experts already suggest the achievement will strengthen the firm's position in a competitive sector. ""From a scientific point of view, it's the latest in a series of dazzling results that DeepMind has produced,"" the University of Oxford's Prof Michael Wooldridge told the BBC. ""The general trajectory in DeepMind seems to be to solve a problem and then demonstrate it can really ramp up performance, and that's very impressive."" DeepMind has previously defeated several of the world's top human players of the Chinese board game Go, as well as teaching itself how to play video games including Pong and Space Invaders. The London-based team is currently trying to develop a system that can beat humans at the space strategy game Starcraft, which is seen as being an even more complex challenge. Thinking time Google is not commenting on the research until it is published in a journal. However, details published on Cornell University's Arxiv site state that an algorithm dubbed AlphaZero was able to outperform Stockfish just four hours after being given the rules of chess and being told to learn by playing simulations against itself. In the 100 games that followed, each program was given one minute's worth of thinking time per move. AlphaZero won 25 games in which it played with white pieces, giving it the first move, and a further three in which it played with black pieces. The two programs drew the remaining 72 games. DeepMind described the level of performance achieved as being ""superhuman"". Google highlighted that Stockfish 8 had previously won 2016's Top Chess Engine Championship. The software was first released in 2008 and has been built on by volunteers in the years since. The open source project has been beaten by another program, Komodo, in two major computer chess challenges this year. Even so, one human chess grandmaster was still hugely impressed by DeepMind's victory. ""I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they played chess,"" Peter Heine Nielsen told the BBC. ""Now I know."" Open v closed AlphaGo Zero's latest achievements do not rest on chess alone. The paper says it was also triumphant in the Japanese board game Shogi versus a leading artificial intelligence program named Elmo, after two hours of self-training. The AlphaZero algorithm won 90 games, drew two and lost eight. Furthermore, after eight hours of self-training it was also able to beat the previous version of itself at Go - winning 60 games and losing 40. Prof Wooldridge noted that all three games were fairly ""closed"" in the sense they had limited sets of rules to contend with. ""In the real world we don't know what is round the corner,"" he explained. ""Coping when you don't know what is coming is much more complicated, and things will get even more exciting when DeepMind moves on to more open problems."" The University of Bath's AI expert Prof Joanna Bryson added that people should be cautious about buying too deeply into the firm's hype. But she added that its knack for good publicity had put it in a strong position against challengers. ""It's not only about hiring the best programmers,"" she said. ""It's also very political, as it helps makes Google as strong as possible when negotiating with governments and regulators looking at the AI sector.""",Google says its AlphaGo Zero artificial intelligence program has triumphed at chess against world-leading specialist software within hours of teaching itself the game from scratch.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It means the Xperia Z5 Premium can both capture video in ""ultra-high definition"" quality and then play it back on its 5.5in (14cm) display without downgrading the footage. All the firm's Z5 handsets also feature a new camera module - the first time the part has been completely overhauled since 2013's original Z1 handset. Sony's mobile division loses money, but its camera components are profitable. Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi and Huawei are among rival handset-makers to have used earlier generations of the Japanese company's photo-capture technologies. However, Sony said the 23 megapixel sensor involved was being kept as an ""exclusive"" to its own devices for the time being. The company recently forecast its handset business would rack up a 60bn yen ($500m; £326m) operating loss in its current financial year. But it forecast its image sensor wing - which also makes parts for bigger cameras - would generate 580bn yen ($4.8bn; £3.1bn) of sales over the same period. Sony hopes its mobile phones will become profitable again in 2016, but its chief executive told the BBC in March that there was ""no guarantee"" it would still be making handsets in five years' time if a turnaround failed to happen. Big battery Sony unveiled its new Android-powered handsets at Berlin's Ifa tech show. The company acknowledged that there was still a limited amount of professional content available in 4K - which provides about four times the number of pixels as 1080p high definition video. But it said the Z5 Premium would upscale videos streamed from YouTube and Netflix to take advantage of the display. One of the big concerns about high-definition screens is that they run down batteries more quickly. Sony says its use of a ""high capacity"" 3,430 mAh battery and memory-on-display tech - which allows a static image to remain on show without requiring extra processing power - should mean the handset lasts for ""up to two days"" between charges. But one expert still had concerns. ""I really doubt it will last two days if you watch a 4K movie on the device,"" said Francisco Jeronimo from the tech research company IDC. ""There's not really a need for a 4K display from a consumers point-of-view. ""But this is really about offering something outstanding that its competitors can't provide today and raising brand awareness."" Low light Sony's new camera module benefits from the introduction of a ""closed-loop actuator"" stabilisation system. This adds a position sensor to the part, which is used to detect small disturbances and then compensate for them by making the lens move up and down in its housing in a related fashion. As a result, it should be able to film less jerky video clips. The addition of a sixth camera element causes more light to fall on to the sensor, which should aid low-light photography. Sony has also added more ""phase-detection"" pixels to the sensor. These are used to speed up autofocus and now cover the complete frame rather than just its central area. The result is that the sensor can react more quickly to action occurring on the edge of shot. The company says this and other improvements mean the camera is capable of refocusing in 0.03 seconds, making it ""the fastest autofocus in a smartphone"". However, Mr Jeronimo doubts whether most users will appreciate the innovations. ""The big question is whether consumers will perceive the added quality when they take a picture,"" he said. ""I took a few pictures with an iPhone 6 and the new Sony Z5 Premium in low light, and to be honest the quality was very similar. ""Once you get to a certain level, it becomes very difficult to notice the difference unless you print the picture in a large size, and that's true for most of the top-end handsets."" Nonetheless, he added, the sensor had a good chance of being adopted by other smartphone companies if it proved superior in independent tests to alternatives. Its competition will include Samsung's recently announced S5K3P3 sensor, which has a lower resolution of 16 megapixels but has been designed to be very thin to offer ""minimal camera protrusion"" from slimline handsets. Fruit phone Other companies that launched new smartphones at Ifa on Wednesday included:",Sony has unveiled the first smartphone to feature a 4K-resolution screen.
"Kicked off by Audi, the system aims to end the frustration of missing the arrival of a package being delivered to home or work. Instead, Audi owners will be able to use their car as a shipping address for items ordered online. A pilot project to test the system is planned to take place in May in Munich. Using Audi's in-car communications system, Connect, DHL delivery drivers would track a customer's vehicle over a specified period of time and then use a digital access code to unlock the boot, the car maker said. This code would then expire as soon as the boot was shut. The deliveries will be available only to customers signed up for online retail service Amazon Prime. In March, the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees US airspace, gave Amazon permission to carry out tests using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for its planned PrimeAir service.","Packages could soon be delivered to the boot of your Audi as part of a trial involving the car maker, Amazon and DHL."
"The data gets added as employees create documents, images and other files as they maintain and update websites. The research found user names, employee IDs, software versions and unique IDs for internal computers in the files. Attackers could use it to craft attacks aimed at senior staff, said security firm Glasswall which did the survey. Banks, law firms, defence contractors and government departments were all found to be leaking data. ""This is really low-hanging fruit,"" said Lewis Henderson, a vice-president at Glasswall, which carried out the survey for the BBC. Leaky media To gather the data, Mr Henderson ""scraped"" target websites for days to ensure he grabbed copies of all the files published by an organisation. Pictures, PDFs, spreadsheets and other documents made public via the sites were all sampled. ""This was all done from a single IP [internet protocol] address and in broad daylight,"" he said. Mr Henderson said that a significant proportion of the files contained metadata which betrayed key information about the people who created that file, when they did it, and the version of the software and machine which they used. About 99% of one particular document type contained this data. In some cases, he added, user names were annotated with internal user IDs and, in one case, he found a detailed guide to a remote login procedure for a law firm's Far Eastern regional office. The cache of data gathered would be a perfect starting point for any sophisticated attack that sought to target senior staff or their aides, said Mr Henderson. ""We did what a malicious actor would do,"" he said, ""which is intelligence gathering on a large scale."" Booby-trapped Armed with the information, Mr Henderson said an attacker would then turn to social media, especially Facebook and LinkedIn, to relate the names found buried in the documents to real people. Emails bearing booby-trapped attachments could then be crafted for specific individuals after studying their biographical details and recent activity. ""The more information you have the more you can customise the package sent to targets,"" he said. The virus code that attackers buried in the malicious attachments could lurk until it hit the machine used by a specific person, he said, guaranteeing it reached a particular target. Chief executives and finance heads were rarely targeted directly, said Mr Henderson. Instead attackers tended to go after their aides who are busy, deal with a lot of different people day-to-day and receive a lot of documents. ""Organisations are always surprised when they get hit by targeted attacks,"" he said. ""They always ask how they found out all that information."" Cleaning up files to strip out useful data was ""simple"", said Mr Henderson. ""All of them will probably have a policy that says this should not happen,"" he added. ""But although there's a policy, there's not necessarily the due diligence and process to do it."" The techniques used by Glasswall were ""absolutely"" the same as those seen in sophisticated, customised cyber-attacks, said Rick Holland, vice-president of strategy at security firm Digital Shadows. ""Anyone doing a targeted attack is going to look at all the documents in a firm's public footprint,"" he said. Any data on user names gathered from that file sweep would then be compared to the logs derived from recent massive data breaches, he said, adding that this was a technique used by security firms who were under contract to test the digital defences of a company or organisation. The breach logs might reveal a password associated with a user name that an attacker could use in a bid to take over an account, said Mr Holland. The recent slew of ""mega-breaches"" meant there were a lot of user names and passwords available to attackers, he said. One site that gathers breach data, Have I Been Pwned, has amassed data on almost four billion accounts stolen from more than 226 websites. Firms failed to view the files and documents on their websites as a security risk, he said, because they were focused more on internal threats. ""Many organisations just do not know that the risk is out there,"" he said. ""Few look at the total risk picture of their digital footprint.""

"From mid-September it will introduce a real-name registration system for its Honour of Kings games, which will be linked to China's public security database. It will identify children and restrict the time they spend on the game. The move is the first of its kind in the world's largest gaming market. Tencent, which also operates the Chinese social network WeChat, posted its first profit decline since 2005 this summer, blaming the drop on tighter regulation, specifically around the approval of licences that allow companies to make money from new mobile games. Honour of Kings is a hugely popular multi-player role-playing battle game based on Chinese historical figures. It is specifically designed to play on a mobile platform, which has added to its popularity because many young gamers do not have access to a games console or PC at home. The app is free to download but players have to pay to upgrade their characters and costumes in order to advance to the next level. The game was criticised last year for its addictive nature in government-owned newspaper People's Daily, which called it ""poison"" and a ""drug"". Following the criticism, Tencent took the decision to restrict the time children could play it - with children under 12 limited to one hour a day and those between 13 and 18 to two hours. The new system will help it more accurately identify young players and ""better guide under-aged players to game sensibly"", the company said in a statement on its official WeChat account. Chinese President Xi Jinping has spoken about the need to address the problem of gaming addiction, in particular voicing concerns about how it may be affecting children's eyesight. Myopia was becoming more common among younger children, the Xinhua News Agency reported him as saying in August. Following his comments, China's Ministry of Education announced that it would curb the number of new online games available to children and take new measures to limit their time on games. Earlier this month, another Tencent game, Monster Hunter World, was banned in China, just days after going on sale. It was not clear what was behind the ban although the Chinese government has blocked dozens of games in the past, typically for featuring excessive violence, drug-taking or sex.","Chinese technology giant Tencent is introducing tough new rules to identify under-age gamers, amid a crackdown on gaming addiction in the country."
"It is the biggest single-event prize awarded at a video games event. The final in Seattle was a close-run affair. Alliance only secured victory after destroying the stronghold of runners-up, Ukraine-based Na'Vi, in the final game of a best-of-five challenge. The news comes months after the US began recognising gamers as pro athletes. The move means that highly skilled players can now apply for a P-1 work visa on the same basis as other sportsmen and sportswomen. 'Slug fest' Dota 2 is the sequel to Defense of the Ancients, a fantasy-themed battle game created by hundreds of volunteers who modified the real-time strategy game Warcraft 3. The follow-up was developed by Valve, which also hosted the tournament - the International - and put up $1.6m of the prize money. The total pot was $2.9m thanks to money raised by taking a cut of the sales of a $10 interactive pamphlet released to help fans follow the event. Sixteen five-player teams from 12 countries took part in the five-day event at Benaroya Hall. The Seattle Times reports that about 1,700 spectators attended, while an online video stream attracted as many as 600,000 simultaneous views at one point. To win, the teams had to co-ordinate in-game characters called ""heroes"" to destroy their opponents' bases while defending their own. The organisers reported that Na'Vi lost the first of the final five games after picking a ""bizarre"" draft of characters in a high-risk move that backfired. However, the next three games were closer, leading to a 2-2 score and leaving the final battle as the decider. ""In a tournament filled with great games, it was the greatest game we have ever seen,"" reported the Dota 2 blog of the final match. ""Not one single action by one team went uncountered by the other. It was a slug fest of team fights."" Alliance ultimately emerged the victor after managing to be the first to destroy their opponents' towers, allowing them to lay waste to a structure known as an ""ancient"". The Stockholm-based team were only formed this year, competing in their first Dota 2 competition in April. Since then they have built a reputation for drafting teams including characters that are often neglected by others. They have now come first in nine different Dota 2 tournaments including the G-1 Champions League in Shanghai. Gaming visa Alliance's latest achievement follows news that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has granted a Canadian pro-gamer a visa. Danny Le became the first international e-sports player to be given the right to work and live in the US after his application was approved on May 29. Officials had previously turned him away at the border when he had tried to move to live close to his Riverside squad-mates. The team compete in tournaments for League of Legends, another battle-themed video game. The title's developer, Riot, subsequently argued that the competitions qualified as a major sports league because six or more teams competed and they generated combined revenues or more than $10m. The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr Le now planned to take part in League of Legends contests for at least five more years before returning to complete his university degree in Canada. It added that other e-sports players, including an Argentinian and an Armenian, had also been granted work visas after Mr Le's breakthrough.","A Swedish e-sports team have won $1.43m (£924,000) after emerging victorious at a Dota 2 tournament."
"In a blogpost, the search giant said it was now going to allow only extensions hosted in its online store to be added to Chrome. Before now it has been possible to add the extras via many different websites but Google said this is often how malicious extensions infect a browser. The change means older extensions added outside the store will be disabled. Extensions are a popular way for people to add extras to their browser that lets them, for instance, grab video clips, play games, use popular programs, send tweets or add utilities. Google polices extensions hosted on its Chrome store but those available via other sites are often unchecked and can be the starting point for a malware campaign, it said. ""Malware can change how browsers work by silently installing extensions on your machine that do things like inject ads or track your browsing activity,"" wrote Erik Kay, engineering director, in a blogpost about the change. Google's policy shift was first announced in November 2013 but Google delayed enforcing it to give developers and software firms a chance to get their extensions through its approval process and on the store.",Google has imposed restrictions on where people can get extensions for its Chrome browser.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Apple kicked things off last night with what had been billed the iPad mini event, but turned out to be a rather larger scale ""refresh"" of the range than expected, with updated desktop and laptop computers, and a fourth version of the full-size iPad. One notable feature was that both the MacBook Pro and the new iMac came without a DVD/CD drive. Apple has decided that, in the days of pulling your content down from the cloud, physical media have had their day - whether you like it or not. There will be grumbling, but I suspect its instincts are correct. However, it was the iPad mini which was the main course, the only product that was really new - if you count becoming smaller as a real leap forward. ""There is nothing as amazing as this!"" declaimed the marketing chief Phil Schiller with typical understatement. That said, the iPad must count as one of the most groundbreaking innovations of recent years. Apple's Tim Cook boasted that 100 million had been sold in just two and a half years, and the tablet was now outselling not just every PC, but the entire range of any PC-maker. That is some shift in consumer behaviour in a short period - and as we know other companies have rushed to imitate the iPad, though with limited impact on its market share. The most successful rivals have been the 7in (17.8cm) Android tablets - in particular the Google Nexus and the Kindle Fire. They have combined decent performance with very keen pricing - but their biggest success has been in provoking Apple to change its mind. For Steve Jobs insisted that 10in (25.4cm) was the minimum size for a tablet. He was talking about the screen size necessary to display useful apps but he may have also had in mind the juicy margins Apple was getting on the bigger device. There were big dangers for the company in pricing the iPad mini - make it too cheap and it could cannibalise the lucrative sales of its big brother, too expensive and it could flop against the competition from Google and Amazon. Before we got to the price, Phil Schiller launched a pretty direct attack on a rival device. Placing a picture of the Google Nexus 7 alongside the iPad mini, he went through their specifications - the iPad's screen size was not so mini, 30% bigger than the Nexus, the overall experience on one was ""great"", on the other ""not so great"". Ah, but when we got to the price, it was clear you paid for that extra real estate. It starts at £269 for the 16GB version, compared to £199 for the Google Nexus, with Amazon's Kindle Fire HD even cheaper at £159. That looks expensive - but we mustn't underestimate the sheer power of the iPad brand. Apple says 90% of all web traffic from a tablet is from an iPad right now - and those hundred million users out there surfing on trains and in cafes are a great marketing resource for the mini. I'm sure it will sell well to people who wanted but couldn't quite afford the full-size version - the big question is whether that comes at the expense of the new fourth generation iPad. And there's more competition about to arrive. The Surface - the new tablet from Microsoft - is on sale on Friday. More on this later, but it looks quite an impressive addition to the high-end professional end of the market. And then next Monday Google holds an Android event, with talk of a 10in Nexus. Tablets, big and small, are crowding out the PC, with sales of personal computers down 8% on a year ago. In 2010 when the iPad was launched many mocked it as a plaything - but Apple, Google and even Microsoft believe the future of their industry is tablet-shaped, so getting the right offer in front of consumers is a very serious business.","In a hectic year, the tectonic plates of technology are shifting again. In the space of a few days, three giants of this industry - Apple, Microsoft and Google - are holding major product launches, and it is tablets which are centre stage."
"By Bobbie JohnsonTechnology reporter, BBC News The frequency of web demonstrations has risen in recent weeks, including a series of strikes in support of controversial website Wikileaks. As more people join such protests, some believe cybercriminals will hijack popular causes for their own ends. ""It's really dangerous for people to go into this,"" said Feike Hacquerbord, a senior analyst at Trend Micro. The problem is that most of the people trying to defend Wikileaks don't realise they might get into bed with criminals,"" he added. Hijacking programs He is among those concerned that the methods used by some online campaigners leave them open to abuse - even potentially fooling mass protests into attacking the wrong target. The worries stem from the methods used by Anonymous, the loose online collective behind the recent string of Wikileaks protests. Their virtual demonstrations, which have so far targeted services including PayPal and Mastercard, involve a series of co-ordinated strikes known as ""denial of service"" attacks. These harness a large number of computers and point them all toward a target website at the same time. If the traffic is significant enough, it can be enough to overload the victim's servers and bring down the service. Although such attacks are illegal in many countries - including the UK - that has not prevented the tactic being used with varying results. But it is also a method that could be exploited by criminals, allowing them to hijack protests for their own financial gain, rather than the political objectives of the demonstrators. A particular issue could be the fact that many protesters use ready-made programs to launch their attacks. This means they could be rewritten by fraudsters in a way that fools demonstrators into thinking they are joining a larger protest while actually sending the attack traffic to the target of cybercriminals ""I'm not sure if will happen more often in the future,"" said Hacquebord. ""But I'm certainly concerned that there are a lot of people who can really do harm."" Net scammers The warnings come after spam-monitoring service Spamhaus was subjected to a distributed denial-of-service attack, with some of the traffic thought to have come from Anonymous protesters. The episode began when Spamhaus blacklisted Wikileaks.info, an unofficial site that provided a list of other sites mirroring wikileaks content. Spamhaus claimed the site the same internet space associated with a well-known gang of Russian cybercriminals and the site's host was a well known source of spam. Following protests from Wikileaks.info, Spamhaus removed the site from its blacklist. However during the wrangles, Spamhaus was subject to a DDoS attack, which it originally blamed on members of Anonymous. The organisation's analysis now suggests the flood of data came largely from the cybercriminals associated with the spamming, with only small amounts of traffic from the Anonymous group. ""A lot of the guys doing this are 14 year-old nerds,"" said Jon Reid of the organisation. ""They've found this new hammer and they're out smashing things."" Some experts have suggested that the impact of the Wikileaks protest itself has been overplayed. In a blog posting last week, Craig Labovitz - the chief scientist at US-based Arbor Networks - called the strikes ""unremarkable"" . But even he admitted that the nature of the attacks could escalate as they become more sophisticated and powerful. ""Internet scammers will notoriously hijack things on the web without an authoritative source,"" added Joseph Bonneau, a security researcher at the University of Cambridge. ""So it's not a total shock that this would happen.""","Online protests could become prime targets for internet fraudsters, according to computer security experts."
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley A groups feature will allow users to specify circles of friends with whom they want to share different data. For the first time, users will also be able to download all the data they have uploaded onto the site. They will also find it easier to see how individual applications are using personal information, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. ""The changes today are about giving people more control over how they share in a lot of different contexts,"" Mr Zuckerberg told BBC News. ""One of the things we have heard is that people just want to share information with smaller groups of people. ""It will enable people to share things that they wouldn't have wanted to share with all of their friends."" He added: ""There are some things you are comfortable saying to all your friends at once but a lot of things you only want to share with your close co-workers or your family and there just hasn't been a great way to do that until now."" Behaviour change The groups feature will allow users form online havens around a discreet circle of people just as they do in the real world. Members will then be able to share information with people specific to that group. A list feature on Facebook already lets users create subsets of their friends but Mr Zuckerberg said that only about 5% of its 500 million users use it. ""Groups will change behaviour,"" Augie Ray a senior analyst with research firm Forrester told BBC News. ""It's possible that people will join Facebook because they will feel they can control who sees their information. I am a very open person and blast everything I say on Twitter or Facebook but now something like this will allow people to think more deeply about who will see what they say, and will increase engagement."" Another analyst Ray Valdes of Gartner called groups ""a major milestone in a very long road that represents part of the ongoing evolution of our social connections"". 'False security' Facebook said its engineers had been in lockdown for the past 60 days working on these new products. One of the new tools called ""Download Your Information"" is designed to enable users to download everything they have ever posted to the site, such as photos, status updates and wall posts. The tool is a major departure for Facebook, which has come under criticism in the past for not allowing users access to their own data. This effectively locked Facebook users into the site, unable to port their data to other sites. ""All the information that is on Facebook comes from people sharing it,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. ""It is not our information. It is people's information. We just have this strong philosophical belief that people own that information and they should be able set exactly who can see it, move it to different applications and use it how they want. They should be able to take it away if they want."" The groups feature is the one the company touted most heavily and one that Mr Zuckerberg seemed most proud of. ""We think that what we have out of the box, version one, blows away everything else,"" he said, referring to ""groups"" services offered by internet stalwarts such as Yahoo! and Google. Privacy has been a constant thorn for the world's biggest social network whenever it introduces new products or changes settings on the site. ""Mostly I am happy they are giving users more control and I think the groups aspect for the most part does give you this added control,"" said Larry Magid, co-director of ConnectSafely.org. Phone sync worries ""The only worry I have is that friends can add people to the group, so if you create a group and are in a group you have to be aware of not only who you add but who others add. ""As long as you are aware of who is in the group it can be a great privacy tool. If it gets out of hand it could give you a sense of false security."" The roll out of new products comes amid reports that a syncing feature on the iPhone lets Facebook access contact data and share it on the site. ""It's very possible that your private phone numbers - and those of lots of your and their friends - are on the site,"" said Charles Arthur of the Guardian newspaper. Another tech blogger, Kurt van Moos, who was the first to warn about this feature in January, outlined his concerns. ""Phone numbers are private and valuable. Most people who have entrusted you with their phone numbers assume you will keep them private and safe,"" he said. In a statement to the BBC, Facebook confirmed that the site allowed them to sync their friends' contact information. ""The ability to sync their contacts is used for the purpose of connecting [users] with their friends,"" it said. ""All of this information is private and is not shared with any friends or any third party. ""Even if someone wanted to, they could not share any of this information with other friends, for example."" Facebook added that users could easily delete contacts copied over from their phones.",Facebook has introduced a raft of features aimed at giving users more control over their personal data.
"The drivers say they are paid below minimum wage levels required by some states and barely above national rates. For 12 hours, the drivers involved in the protests plan to turn off the Uber app and stop working for the ride-hailing firm. The protests will take place on 8 May when Uber makes its stock market debut. Cash levy ""Uber's much-anticipated IPO [initial public offering] will put millions into the pockets of executives, but the drivers who are the core of the service of the company will get nothing,"" Shona Clarkson from Gig Workers Rising, which is helping to organise the protests, told The Guardian. Gig Workers Rising is believed to have 4,000 drivers among its members. The drivers involved in the protests have four demands: Drivers would continue to be exploited if they did not get more protections, said Ms Clarkson. A letter has been delivered to Uber's headquarters detailing the drivers' demands and warning it of the shutdown. In the letter, drivers expressed fears that pay rates would be cut after the IPO as the company sought to make itself more ""palatable"" to investors. Publicly available figures suggest that Uber and Lyft drivers are paid $8.55 (£6.87) an hour in the US. This is higher than the national mandated minimum wage level of $7.25, but less than rates set by some states. In California the minimum wage rates for drivers is $11. New York now operates a city by-law that demands drivers working for Uber, and other ride-hailing firms like Lyft and Juno, must get paid at least $17.22 an hour. Gig Workers uprising is organising protests in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Diego. Some drivers in other cities, including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Washington DC, are also expected to turn off the app on 8 May. A separate protest will be held outside Uber's head office in San Francisco on the same day. Uber has not yet reacted to the drivers demands nor responded to a BBC request for comment. The company has recently run a driver bonus scheme that rewards regular drivers with cash. The scheme is believed to be a way for it to get around US regulations that stop it rewarding drivers, who are not its direct employees, with shares. Drivers who clocked up more than 10,000 trips for the firm received $1,000 as a reward. However, as Uber driver Jay Cradeur pointed out in a blog, anyone who invested the cash that rival Lyft handed out to its drivers in a similar scheme could have ended up losing some of their bonus if they bought the firm's shares, because their value had dropped sharply. Update 7 May 2019: This story has been amended to make it clear who is organising protests among Uber drivers across the US.",Uber drivers in seven US cities are planning protests to highlight what they claim are poor working conditions and low wages at the ride-hailing firm.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It described its Infinity Flex Display as ""the foundation of the smartphone of tomorrow"" and said it intended to start production within months. When unfolded, the device resembles a 7.3in (18.5cm) tablet. When closed, a separate smaller ""cover display"" on the handset's other side comes into use. Samsung has teased the concept for more than five years and had been vying with Huawei to show off a device first. However, both were upstaged a week ago when little-known start-up Royole unveiled a foldable phone of its own. Unlike Royole's FlexPai, Samsung obscured the final look of its device. It placed it in a case to hold off revealing the design until a later event. It also did not disclose how it will brand the phone. However, it did reveal that the forthcoming handset would be able to run three apps at once. Justin Denison, the executive who unveiled the handset, noted that when folded up the device fitted ""neatly inside"" a jacket pocket thanks to the displays involved being thinner than those on earlier phones. Unlike the FlexPai, the two sides of Samsung's device lie flat when closed. But this comes at the cost of there being noticeable breaks in its bezel, at least on the prototype demoed. Shipments of Samsung's smartphones were 13.4% lower in the July-to-September quarter than for the same period the previous year, according to market research firm IDC. Although the sector as a whole shrank over the 12 months, the South Korean firm still underperformed, with its market share slipping from 22.1% to 20.3%. But analysts say a flexible phone has the potential to strengthen Samsung's brand and boost interest in its wider family of devices. ""We've already had squeezable, swivel, clamshell and even foldable phones,"" commented IDC's Marta Pinto. ""Differentiation is super important. Samsung's smartphone sales are declining as it faces serious competition from Huawei and other Chinese brands. ""If it can bring a new and really interesting device to the market it could be a chance to regain momentum and return to growth."" Google is also holding a developer event of its own for Android programmers. One of its engineering chiefs announced that it would soon add support to the operating system to allow other manufactures to create foldable phones of their own. It also tweeted an animation of the concept in action. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter Finally, some interesting innovation in the smartphone space. Or smartphone and tablet space, I guess you could say. A new form factor can be a huge boost to device-makers, but only if it makes sense. A flip phone made previously big devices pocket-sized, and then smartphones brought button-less interaction to our palms. But what will foldable screens bring? One of the reasons why Samsung teased this device at its developers conference was to give software-makers a chance to think about how to make the most of the new possibilities a foldable screen might bring. There's a reason why just about every new smartphone up until today looked the same: it worked. To go foldable, there's likely to be big trade-offs on price, screen quality and perhaps weight - the device Samsung teased today did look chunky. I'll hold back on a verdict until I get a chance to hold one for myself. IBM Simon: The first mobile phone to offer a touchscreen user-interface - but its battery only lasted an hour. Siemens S10: The first handset with a colour display - although only red, green, blue and white could be shown. LG Prada: The handset debuted a capacitive touchscreen - detecting finger taps by changes in the display's electrical field rather than pressure. iPhone: Apple made use of ""multi-touch"", detecting several points of contact - allowing pinch-to-zoom and other interactions. Nokia N85: First phone with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display, letting it show deeper blacks and better contrast. Samsung Galaxy Note: Although not the first ""phablet"", the handset proved there was demand for a 5+ inch display, despite claims it was ""comically huge"". LG G Flex: The curved design was derided as being a gimmick, but points the way to the true ""bendy"" phones of the future. Sharp Aquos Crystal: The phone's ""edgeless"" look foreshadowed today's trend to keep bezels to a minimum. Samsung Galaxy Note Edge: Samsung's first handset to wrap its screen over one its sides used the extra space for notifications and app shortcuts. Sony Xperia Z5 Premium: The smartphone premiered a 4K display before it was easy to obtain such ultra-high definition mobile content. Essential Phone: The start-up beat Apple to featuring a camera notch in its display, which allowed the rest of the screen to extend upwards. Royole FlexPai: The California-based start-up surprised the industry when it revealed the ""world's first foldable phone"" last month.",Samsung has unveiled a folding handset at an event in San Francisco.
"Those on the list include several of Tencent's products including the hit video game PUBG Mobile and WeChat Work. Previously the government had banned 59 of the most popular apps including TikTok over national security concerns. India's IT Ministry said it had ""credible information"" the latest batch were acting against India's interests. Other apps affected include: The ministry said it had received many complaints from ""various sources"" including several reports about ""misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India"". ""The compilation of this data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures."" The ban comes against the backdrop of tensions along a disputed Himalayan border. Both India and China deployed more troops to the Ladakh region in June and clashes have left at least 20 Indian troops dead. Satellite images appear to show that China has built new structures overlooking the Himalayan border region. The US has also recently taken action against Chinese apps, threatening to ban TikTok and ordering US firms to stop doing business with Tencent's WeChat platform. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has said that the administration also has other Chinese apps within its sights.","A further 118 Chinese mobile apps have been banned by the Indian government, as tensions between the two countries continue to rise."
"The biggest-selling video game was the latest Fifa 21 football game, with more than two million downloads and discs sold. Disney's Frozen 2 was the most-purchased movie, while Lewis Capaldi topped the 2020 album sales chart. The Entertainment Retailers' Association (ERA) published the report. It included data supplied by the Official Charts Company and the Interactive Software Federation of Europe. However, it did not reveal the most-streamed television programmes and movies because services such as Netflix, Prime Video and BBC iPlayer do not make the data publicly available. The ERA said digital services had grown faster than ever before, with revenue reaching £7.8bn, up £1.4bn on 2019. The group's chief executive Kim Bayley described it as a ""dramatic leap"" which ""filled the gap left by shuttered cinemas, concert halls and retail stores"" while the country spent months in lockdown. ""If there was ever a year in which we needed entertainment, it was 2020,"" she said. Sales of most physical entertainment formats such as DVDs, Blu-Rays and CDs were all down, with the exception of vinyl which saw sales increase 13% to £110m. Music download sales were also down by almost 20%, as consumers switched to streaming services .

"Bitcloud aims to harness the same methods used to mine Bitcoins, to provide services currently controlled by internet service providers (ISPs) and corporations. Individuals would perform tasks such as storing, routing and providing bandwidth, in return for payment. The founders are searching for developers for the project. ""We will start by decentralising the current internet, and then we can create a new internet to replace it,"" they said. Just as Bitcoin miners provide computing power and are rewarded for solving complex mathematical equations with the virtual currency, so individual net users would be rewarded based on how much bandwidth they contribute to the Bitcloud network. ""Adding the profit motive to the equation gives this project a chance to succeed where many others have failed in the past,"" reads the group's white paper. A currency known as Cloudcoins is proposed to underpin the network. ""If you're interested in privacy, security, ending internet censorship, decentralising the internet and creating a new mesh network to replace the internet, then you should join or support this project,"" the group said. 'Much to do' Among examples of new services, the proposal describes how YouTube could become WeTube. ""WeTube can act as a replacement for YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Soundcloud, Spotify and other audio video streaming services,"" it said. Artists would be paid with a percentage of advertising revenues, it said. Critics may question how such a model can be sustained but the success of Bitcoin suggests that such decentralised networks can work. Online retailer Overstock began accepting Bitcoin payments earlier this month and recently Google revealed it was looking at ways to integrate Bitcoins into its payment systems. But the team behind Bitcloud, whose names have not been released, acknowledged they were only at the beginning of the project. ""There are still many key decisions that need to be made in the Bitcloud protocol. We have a basic idea of how everything will work, but we need assistance from programmers and thinkers from around the world who want to help,"" they said. ""The idea is an interesting thought-experiment at least,"" Boing Boing co-founder Cory Doctorow blogged on the site. ""Using market forces to allocate resources on the internet is an old one and I remain sceptical that this produces optimal outcomes,"" he added.",An ambitious project has been launched that the developers hope could one day replace the current internet.
"EU officials had criticised the firm for favouring its own price comparison results when answering search queries. The tech giant said it would now direct users to other price comparison sites and merchants selling products. It will also make it easier for Android users to select web browsers other than Google's own Chrome browser. The changes to search mean that results from rival sites, such as TripAdvisor or Kelkoo, will become more prominent to avoid Google's own retail recommendations dominating. Last year, rivals had complained to the European Commission (EC) that search results were unfairly prioritising Google's own shopping service over others. Google made the adjustments shortly before a €1.49bn (£1.28bn) fine was handed down by European regulators on Wednesday. This was also in relation to what officials called unfair competition activities: blocking ads from rivals offering alternative web search options. Browser options Android users will find it easier to choose a different web browser on their phones and tablets thanks to the other change announced. Chrome comes pre-installed on Android devices, but users will now be asked directly if they would like to use another browser. It comes a year after the EC fined Google €4.34bn (£3.72bn) for abusing its market position and making rivals' browsers less accessible. ""Now we'll also do more to ensure that Android phone owners know about the wide choice of browsers and search engines available to download to their phones,"" Google executive Kent Walker wrote in a blog. ""This will involve asking users of existing and new Android devices in Europe which browser and search apps they would like to use."" The BBC has contacted the EC for comment.","Google has said it will make changes to how search results are displayed within the EU, in response to scrutiny it has faced over competition practices."
"The plans were presented at a council meeting on Monday by Jehn Balajadia, operations co-ordinator of the firm. She said: ""The purpose of Boring Company is to alleviate soul-destroying traffic and augment public transit."" Mr Musk, also chief of Tesla Inc and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, didn't speak at the meeting. A report by the Culver City manager's office stated: ""The Boring Company has proposed a privately funded human transportation tunnel that would run underneath the Westside of Los Angeles. ""The tunnel would contain a high-speed underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported on autonomous electric skates travelling at 125-150mph."" The electric skates will be designed to carry either single passenger vehicles or what are described as ""mass transit"" pods capable of transporting between eight and 16 people. The company says the plan would ease road congestion and allow people to move around the city more easily. Ms Balajadia stressed that the company was not looking for public funding and that the cost to passengers would be comparable to, or less than existing forms of public transit in the region. Mr Musk, who himself lives in Bel Air, is reported by Bloomberg to have first mooted the idea of a tunnel system back in December 2016, when he tweeted that he was fed up with LA traffic and would ""build a tunnel boring machine"". The proposed route is from the headquarters of Musk's company SpaceX in Hawthorne to West Los Angeles passing underneath Sepulveda Boulevard through Culver City. The plans are reported to have been well-received by some members of the council as a way of dealing with the region's traffic congestion. However, concerns were expressed by council member Meghan Sahli-Wells about a private company creating a system that may compete with existing public transport agencies in Los Angeles. ""This is really seductive,"" said Ms Sahli-Wells. ""It looks super-sexy and super-easy, but it's half-baked from a public perspective."" As reported on the BBC last July the serial entrepreneur also tweeted his interest in building a Loop transport system on the East Coast. The difference between a Loop and a Hyperloop is that the latter requires a vacuum to be created within the tubes to eliminate air friction while the former does not. When asked for further details on the claims in his tweets, a spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: ""The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials. ""With a few exceptions, feedback has been very positive and we have received verbal support from key government decision-makers for tunnelling plans, including a Hyperloop route from New York to Washington DC. ""We look forward to future conversations with the cities and states along this route and we expect to secure the formal approvals necessary to break ground later this year."" Last July, the company said that it was expecting to start digging by the end of 2017.","Elon Musk's Boring Company has presented plans to build a tunnel under Culver City, California for a Hyperloop-like transport system."
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent The allegations stem from a Wall Street Journal report in early October. Russian hackers had used Kaspersky software to identify classified files on the NSA contractor's home computer, which they then stole, it said. It later emerged Kaspersky had also copied files off the PC itself. But the company has now said this was not deliberate and any classified documents were destroyed. It said its researchers had been investigating malicious software created by ""the Equation Group"", which is widely understood to be Kaspersky's codeword for the NSA. And this research had included looking for signatures relating to known Equation activity on machines running the company's software. On 11 September 2014, the company said, one of its products deployed on a home computer with an internet protocol (IP) address in Baltimore, Maryland - close to where the NSA is based - had reported what appeared to be variants of the malware used by the Equation Group. Soon after, the user had disabled the Kaspersky Lab anti-virus tool and downloaded and installed pirated software infected with another, separate form of malware. And when the Kaspersky product had been re-activated, it had also detected this malware and new variants of Equation malware inside a 7zip archive - a file containing compressed documents. This had been sent back to Kaspersky Lab and found to contain known and unknown Equation tools, source code and classified documents, indicating the user of the computer had been not a victim of Equation but one of its authors. Eugene Kaspersky, the company's founder and chief executive, had then ordered the classified data should be deleted from the company's systems, and within days it had been. Kaspersky had kept only the malware ""binaries"", computer code necessary to improve protection for its customers. ""According to security software industry standards, requesting a copy of an archive containing malware is a legitimate request,"" the firm said. ""We also found no indication the information ever left our corporate networks."" The Wall Street Journal report had said the Russian government had secretly scanned computers using Kaspersky software to spy on the US government - not necessarily with the company's knowledge. Israeli intelligence Kaspersky denies creating ""signatures"" specifically designed to search for top secret or classified material. And it has now said the only third-party intrusion in its networks was by Duqu 2.0 - malware linked to Israeli intelligence. Following the Wall Street Journal report, the New York Times had reported that Israel had penetrated Kaspersky's networks in 2014 and alerted the US to the possibility of Kaspersky software being used for espionage. Kaspersky has also said the separate form of malware not linked to the Equation Group that it had detected on the Maryland PC, had been Smoke Bot or Smoke Loader, a Trojan created by a Russian hacker in 2012 and sold on Russian underground forums. Prime target And during this period the command-and-control servers of this malware were registered to what appeared to be a Chinese entity. ""Given that system owner's potential clearance level, the user could have been a prime target of nation states,"" the Kaspersky spokesman said. US federal agencies have now been told to remove all Kaspersky software from their computers. The Kaspersky spokesman said: ""Kaspersky Lab security software, like all other similar solutions from our competitors, has privileged access to computer systems to be able to resist serious malware infections and return control of the infected system back to the user,"" the company says in its statement. ""This level of access allows our software to see any file on the systems that we protect. With great access comes great responsibility.""",The Russian-headquartered anti-virus company Kaspersky Lab has hit back at reports it deliberately extracted sensitive files from a US National Security Agency worker's computer.
"By BBC MonitoringAnalysis IS and other jihadist groups have been exploiting new functionality introduced by the app in late September, which allows users to broadcast their messages to an unlimited number of members via their own Telegram ""channel"". In an announcement on Wednesday evening, the Berlin-based Telegram said it had shut down 78 IS channels and promised to make it easier for users to flag ""objectionable public content"" shared via the app. ""We were disturbed to learn that Telegram's public channels were being used by ISIS [alternative name for IS] to spread their propaganda,"" said a statement from Telegram, which was set up in 2013 by two Russian brothers, Pavel and Nikolai Durov. Paris attacks The action followed claims by IS for the 13 November Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on 31 October. Shortly before the key IS propaganda channel on Telegram was shut down on 18 November, it had been used to publish IS's English-language magazine Dabiq which hailed the Paris attacks and featured an image of the bomb IS claims to have used to bring down the plane. IS had shifted its propaganda distribution to Telegram from Twitter on 26 September, just four days after Telegram trumpeted the launch of its new ""Channels"" tool. An official IS channel dubbed Nashir, which translates as ""Distributor"" in English, quickly became the platform where IS propaganda started appearing first, often several minutes before being posted to Twitter - IS's other favoured outlet. The channel had amassed over 16,000 subscribers before it was shut down along with a raft of other IS channels used to distribute the group's propaganda in a wide range of languages, including English, French, Russian, Turkish and Urdu. But many other jihadist Telegram channels continue to be active, including official channels operated by al-Qaeda's branches in Yemen and North Africa and others supportive of IS. And the clampdown by Telegram has not stopped IS getting its message out, with the group reverting to its network of accounts on Twitter to publish its latest material. Since July 2014, when IS's last official branded accounts were suspended by Twitter, the group's media operatives have been caught up in a cat-and-mouse game with the site administration, which routinely suspends IS's quasi-official, non-branded accounts. IS's hopes that Telegram would offer it a more stable and resilient platform for its propaganda appear to have been dashed. ""Secret chat"" But Telegram has indicated that it does not intend to act against terrorists' use of the app's private messaging service, saying it would only move to suppress illegal ""publicly available"" material. ""All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them,"" the company says on its website. Even before IS launched its latest propaganda channel via Telegram, there had been evidence that the group and its members were using the app's private messaging facility. In September, IS had advertised an Iraqi mobile phone number, which people could use to get in touch with the group via Telegram in order to pay a ransom for two hostages being held by the group. And jihadists inspired by IS, including a British teenager convicted recently, have used the app's secure encrypted messaging to conduct attack planning. Jihadists have been drawn by Telegram's boast to provide a ""secret chat"" facility, which heavily encrypts messages user-to-user with a unique key to avoid interception by hackers or government agencies. Telegram is so confident of its security that it twice offered a reward of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the first person who could crack its encryption.

"The founder of the seized Megaupload websites is wanted in the US on charges of copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering. The US had opposed his proposal to broadcast the hearing on YouTube. Dotcom said on Twitter that the decision was ""breaking new ground"" and streaming would start on Wednesday. He told the BBC there was a definite public interest in his case. Dotcom's lawyer said the move was ""democracy at its finest"". ""It provides everybody in the world with a seat in the gallery of the New Zealand courtroom,"" Ira Rothken told the Associated Press, saying there would be a 20 minute delay on the live feed. Analysis, Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter Kim Dotcom has won a major victory here. By getting the hearing livestreamed, he'll hope to expose what he says are some of the incompetencies of this entire case. By bringing the world's technology community into the court room, instead of relying on media reports, he hopes to build support. Mr Dotcom praised the judge for being ""brave"" enough to allow the streaming to happen. But it does come with an odd stipulation which many might find a tad naive on the part of the court. As well as a 20 minute delay, in which some details can be beeped out from what goes out on the internet, the judge has also ruled that once the six-week hearing is over it cannot be kept online forever. But to think, given all the people likely to watch it online, nobody is going to record it independently and publish shows a poor grasp of how the online community operates. The video of Kim Dotcom's hearing will be all over the internet, in perpetuity, whether the judge wants it to be or not. German-born Dotcom ran file-sharing site Megaupload.com, which once had millions of users storing files and downloading movies and songs. The FBI took control of the site and other domain names belonging to the business in January 2012. Federal prosecutors said it had cost movie studios, music labels and other copyright-holders more than $500m (£382m) in lost revenue. Last December, a New Zealand court ruled that the German-born entrepreneur could be extradited to face charges of copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering. But Dotcom's lawyers launched an appeal, arguing that he should not be held responsible for the actions of the site's users, and did not get a fair hearing. US concern The request for livestreaming came on the first day of the appeal hearing in Auckland, which is expected to last up to eight weeks. Another defence lawyer, Ron Mansfield, said there were ""unprecedented issues of public and international interest"" raised by the case and added that coverage should not be limited to traditional media. Lawyers for the US had said streaming could influence a potential future jury. The High Court judge, Justice Murray Gilbert, criticised the fact the request had not been made in advance but said he wanted to hear the views of local media outlets before making a decision. Televised justice Debate still rages as to whether televising trials is a necessary part of transparent justice or something that turns legal procedure into a circus. But some very high profile cases have been put on camera:",A judge in New Zealand has said internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom will be allowed to stream his appeal against extradition live online.
"The M200 series use ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance broadcast) receivers to detect broadcasts from nearby manned flights. The transmissions allow users to see the position, altitude and velocity of surrounding aircraft so they can take evasive action if required. One expert praised the move. ""It's an extra safety measure and will help drone operators work in restricted airspace,"" explained Dave Black from the commercial drone services firm Blackwing Aerial. ""The way we tend to do this is to contact air traffic controllers before we fly, tell them where we are flying and then they contact us by phone if there's going to be any conflict. ""But in time, the authorities may well also want this kind of feature fitted as standard before they approve operations with larger drones."" Mr Black added that some enthusiasts had created their own ADS-B kit by connecting a receiver to a Raspberry Pi computer with customised software and then tying this to their drone. But he added that an integrated unit would be appreciated. The announcement was made at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. False confidence? DJI announced last July that it intended to develop an ADS-B collision avoidance system in conjunction with uAvionix, a specialist in the technology. The M200 series drones, which debut the feature, are designed for industrial applications such as inspecting power lines and mapping construction sites. They have a range of 7km (4.3 miles) and can stay airborne for up to 38 minutes, but some country's regulators currently require them to stay within line-of-sight. The aircraft are bigger and heavier than many consumer drones - they weigh 3.8kg (8.4lb) and can carry a further 2kg of equipment - so potentially pose a greater risk if involved in a crash. However, one analyst warned that the new safety system could give drone pilots a false sense of confidence. ""The problem is that ADS-B isn't yet required for all aircraft, so even if you had a receiver you're not necessarily seeing all the traffic in the area,"" explained Colin Snow, chief executive of the Skylogic Research consultancy. ""Its use is also not required at the low altitudes at which commercial drones tend to fly. ""So, let's say you are a farmer in a rural area using a drone. There's a danger a crop duster could come into your zone - and they often do not use ADS-B - and catch you unaware. ""The other issue is that you only 'see' other aircraft when their ADS-B pings are retransmitted from towers on the ground and sometimes that doesn't happen.""",The world's bestselling drone-maker has unveiled models that warn their operators when there is a risk posed by nearby aeroplanes or helicopters.
"TV programmes, comedy series and films such as The Imitation Game are available via the service that already lets people stream video content. Amazon said it would not levy any additional charge for the service. In the UK, a year's subscription to Prime costs £79. The offline option is available in the US, UK, Germany and Austria. Video battle Owners of Amazon's Fire tablet who are also signed up to the Prime service have been able to download movies and programmes for months. An updated Amazon Video app now extends this to non-Amazon branded gadgets. Amazon is the first net-based video subscription service to offer the downloading option on Android and iOS devices. Licensing restrictions will mean some content will be available only for streaming rather than downloading. In a statement, Amazon said its own video series were all available offline and added a list of many other popular programmes, including 24, Downton Abbey, Hannibal and Vikings, that were also available. Rik Henderson, senior editor at tech news site Pocket-lint, said offline viewing was ""nigh-on essential"" given modern media viewing habits. ""As there are still some licensing issues, not everything on the Prime platform is available to download, but parents will no doubt be happy that shows such as Peppa Pig and Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom are,"" he said. ""Amazon has struck a significant blow in its battle with Netflix,"" he said. ""Although Netflix has always pooh-poohed the idea of offline downloads, it is hard to see the US firm not copying its biggest rival in the near future.""

"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter But the internet media company's fortunes have changed drastically, with sales falling from $7.2bn (£5bn) in 2008 to $4.6bn (£3.1bn) last year. This is partly because Google and Facebook have come to dominate the online advertising market from where Yahoo derives its revenue. A series of chief executives has also failed to stem the decline. This week, Reuters reported investors had called for Yahoo's core business to be sold after a slump in its share price. Some said it could lead to the sacking of current chief executive Marissa Mayer and even the end of the Yahoo brand itself. So where did it all go wrong for the firm and what lies ahead? Inauspicious beginnings? Dark clouds haven't always surrounded Yahoo. Founded in 1994 by Stanford University graduates Jerry Yang and David Filo, the firm swiftly grew to become one of the internet's first web portals, competing with the likes of MSN and Lycos. ""It was a one-stop shop bringing together news and other services for users lacking expertise in navigating the internet,"" said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research and a 20-year tech analyst. The company also survived the dot com crash of 2000 and its sales climbed tenfold between 2001 and 2008. However, Mr Kramer said that over time the concept of web portals had become ""outmoded"". ""In its main search and display ad businesses, Yahoo found itself being overtaken by rivals like Gmail and Hotmail or younger upstarts, messaging apps like Whatsapp or WeChat,"" he said. ""News aggregation came from Facebook, Twitter and new digital channels like Huffington Post or Vice."" He added: ""Yahoo also fell behind the curve in search - partnering with Microsoft, which had tried to buy it - while it was slow to scale up in video and mobile."" Left behind? The problem was Yahoo generated most of its revenue by selling advertising space on such platforms - and as its audience drifted to other sites, its sales faltered. Highlighting the discord, chief executive Mr Yang stepped down in December 2008 and the firm laid off 7% of its workforce a month later. The company needed to reinvent itself - but even Mr Yang's replacement, Carole Bartz, admitted she had struggled with the question of what Yahoo is when she took over in 2009. ""We're not a search company. We're not a display [advertising] company. We're a broad-based internet technology company that serves up the most interesting content on the internet to 600 million people,"" she later said. Mr Kramer said the high level of the churn at the top at the firm did not help either. Ms Bartz soon lost her job in September 2011 and her replacement, Scott Thompson, only lasted four months before resigning over claims he falsified his resumé. ""They went through an endless succession of management changes at a time when they really needed to steady the ship,"" Mr Kramer said. ""They were also besieged by activist investors calling for change, continuing the cycle of management churn."" What next? Ms Mayer, who has been in situ since July 2012, now faces a similar revolt. She has tried to bolster Yahoo by acquiring firms such as Flurry, a mobile analytics service, and Tumblr, the blogging service. But its core internet business continues to lose money. In fact, most of the internet company's $33bn (£21.8bn) value is attributed to its shareholding in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. After reversing a plan to sell the stake, Ms Mayer has adopted a strategy to spin off the core business into a new company But on Monday, Reuters reported several major Yahoo shareholders wanted Ms Mayer to sell the core business outright. A source said she had the support of her board, but multiple investors have called for her resignation. Mr Kramer says the choice is a simple one: ""Either the CEO needs to put herself out of a job by selling the business, or be given room to pursue a fresh strategy, with restructuring already promised to be announced with the 2015 results."" He added: ""The media likes to say Yahoo is a turnaround, but that's the wrong way to think about it. ""It really needs to grow - or buy - entirely new businesses to bolt on to its existing franchise, to attract new audiences. ""This is what Mayer is a trying to do, even if the execution of the plans has been poor.""","During the 90s and early 2000s, Yahoo was a veritable web titan - a leader in email, online news and search."
"By Carolyn RiceTechnology reporter, BBC News Funny cat photos and videos have become an online fascination in the last few years and have even created ""superstars"" like Grumpy Cat and Nyan Cat. One is a real-life miserable-looking moggy who has more than 2.5 million Facebook fans; the other is an animated kitten whose rather unimaginative journey across a screen has been viewed more than 100 million times. Now, one app developer thinks it can tap in to this trend and use cute cat photos to improve people's memory function when learning languages. Memrise analysed data to see what helped their members retain information. The company discovered an interesting link between the funny photos and people being able to recall phrases. The team studied the results of memory tests to work out which photos worked best. ""We wanted to know what kinds of visual mnemonics were most effective at helping people to learn fast,"" says Ben Whately, chief operating officer at Memrise. ""The pattern began to emerge that pictures of cats always featured disproportionately among the most effective,"" he says. 'Weapons of mass cuteness' Using this research, the company developed CatAcademy, an app that shows photos of cats in humorous poses and displays a corresponding phrase in Spanish. The company cites research from Japan, which describes the relationship between cuteness and improved cognitive function, to explain why this method is so successful. Ed Cooke, is the co-founder of Memrise and in 2004 became a Grand Master of Memory. To win this title he had to memorise 1,000 digits in an hour, 10 randomly shuffled decks of cards in one hour, and be able to memorise one deck of cards in two minutes or less. ""It's quite a boring process learning lots of information but the art of memory is the art of using information,"" he tells the BBC. ""We learn through interesting imagery. You use your imagination in a powerful fashion."" The company has been providing language learning applications for three years and claims to have helped more than a million members pick up new linguistic skills. Their products already use images to teach but this is the first time that only cats have been used. ""The most popular [images] on our site were cats. We put this down to the internet's obsession with them but what we found is that a cat's cuteness means you really pay attention,"" says Mr Cooke. The team at Memrise crowdsourced the photos for the app and decided to advertise for the post of Director of Cat Meme Creation. They listed all 1,000 phrases they were looking to illustrate, on Tumblr, and asked people to upload their funniest photos. There was certainly plenty of choice. The last few years has seen the rise of the cat-meme, funny images posted online with an accompanying phrase. Whole websites have developed dedicated to these funny feline photos. icanhascheezburger is one of the biggest with more than 40 million hits a month. ""For the past 10,000 years we've been biologically engineering cats to be weapons of mass cuteness,"" chief executive Ben Huh tells the BBC. ""[They] are more complex and expressive than dogs, so they have remained the king of the internet."" Mr Whately says the popularity of these sites got the developers thinking. ""How can we use [people's] internet obsession with cats? That's what technology should be asking, and taking advantage of it to help people learn,"" says Mr Whately. But will apps like CatAcademy really make a difference to the way people learn? The more visual the impact and the less it is surrounded by words the more effective it will be as a learning tool says educational psychologist Barry Bourne. ""It should be simple and not too complex."" ""Humour and visual impact are important, they're the ideal combination. Looking around at things I see on the internet and in adverts they are arresting people's attention."" It may be that the internet cat-meme craze is entering its next phase as a tool for providing more than just laughs. Ed Cooke certainly believes that this is the case and has high hopes for future apps. ""The utopian scenario is that we develop a way of learning languages that works and is authentically hilarious,"" he says.",Amusing photos of cats may provide hours of entertainment for people browsing online but can they be used to help people remember things?
"Within minutes of making the game free online the swell of demand caused the site to slow and send error messages. Epic blamed the slowdown on ""heavy traffic"" and said it was working to fix the problem. Grand Theft Auto, known as GTA to fans, is made by Rockstar Games and is one of the top selling gaming franchises. Every week Epic Games makes a 'mystery game' available without charge on its store. The games are available for PCs or Macs. Users who download the week's mystery game can keep it forever, even when the free to download period expires. On Wednesday it was announced Grand Theft Auto V would be this week's game. The game became available at 11:00 EDT (15:00 GMT). Within minutes of the launch users began to report slowdowns and error messages. On Twitter, the company tried to calm fans. Epic Games attributed the slowdown to high demand. Grand Theft Auto V has earned more than any other single game ever released, according to MarketWatch. More than 100 million copies have been sold since its release in 2013. The slowdown and crashes appear to have lasted several hours and caused problems on other Epic platforms as well. Fortnite, which is made by Epic, appeared to be having trouble with its launcher and the mobile game Battle Breakers was also exercising issues.

"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The social network said it now would not remove accounts until it had a process for ""memorialising"" dead users on the network. It admitted not having a policy in place was a ""miss on our part”. The firm said it was taking action on inactive accounts due to regulatory concerns. It said once it had a full process in place, account deactivations would occur in the EU first. This was in order, Twitter said, to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ""We apologise for the confusion and will keep you all posted,"" the company said in a series of tweets posted on Wednesday. On Monday Twitter had begun contacting users who hadn't logged in in the past six months, warning them that they would have their accounts deleted unless they signed in and agreed to the firm's latest privacy policy. After reporting from the BBC and others, the company admitted it had not considered the issue of the potential upset that would be caused by the removal of accounts belonging to users who had died. Writing on TechCrunch, Drew Olanoff, a communications officer at investment firm Scaleworks, said his ""heart sank"" when he learned of Twitter's plans, as he often checked in on his father's account, several years after his death. ""It’s my way, odd or not, of remembering him. Keeping his spirit alive. His tweets are timestamped moments that he shared with the world,"" Mr Olanoff wrote.

Interactions with the account are limited in order to help prevent trolling and other abuse. Twitter said it would create such a tool.

"Tor is an anonymous web browser, used by those wishing to access the dark web and avoid government surveillance. It is very popular in Russia. The hackers stole some 7.5 terabytes of data from SyTech, a contractor for Russia's Federal Security Service FSB, and included details of its projects. It is not clear how successful the attempt to crack the anonymous browser was, as the method relied heavily on luck to match Tor users to their activity. Hackers from a group known as 0v1ru$ gained access to the company on 13 July, and replaced its internet homepage with a smug smiley face often used by internet trolls. The information was shared with other hackers and journalists. How did they plan to crack Tor? To crack Tor, SyTech came up with Nautilus-S, which involved actively taking part in Tor and being part of the network. When a user connects to Tor, internet service providers are able to see that Tor is being used. This data can be demanded by the FSB, and other state authorities in other countries. However, the ISPs do not know what sites are being visited through the system - just that it is being used. But the Tor network is run by volunteers and enthusiasts - and SyTech set up a ""contribution"" to the network known as an exit node - the last computer the signal passes through before reaching the website. If a user, by chance, happens to exit the network through SyTech's node, the contractor will know which website is being visited, but not who the visitor is. There are two potential risks: combining the ISP data of who is using the network with which sites are visited at what times could, theoretically, help to identify someone – if they are lucky and the person randomly exits the network through their node. But SyTech could also carry out a so-called ""man in the middle"" attack, and replace the webpage the user thought they were visiting with something else. The system of attack is not unheard of - a 2014 research paper from Karlstad University academics highlighted the use of ""malicious exit relays"". But a spokesperson for the Tor project disputed how viable SyTech's attempt to crack Tor would be. ""Although malicious exit nodes could see a fraction of the traffic exiting the network, by design, this would not be enough to deanonymise Tor users,"" they said. ""Large-scale effective traffic correlation would take a much larger view of the network, and we don't see that happening here."" What were the other projects? The attempt to crack the most widely-used anonymous browser was just one of the projects unveiled by the hack. Others included: Nautilus: Another version of Nautilus, without the ""-S"", was designed to collect information about social media users Reward: An attempt to find a flaw in the BitTorrent person-to-person system used by millions to download and share illegal copies of movies, TV shows and games Mentor: Designed to search email servers of major companies Hope / Tax-3: Projects which deal with how Russia's internet connects to and interacts with the outside network - and how to keep sensitive information safe There were at least 20 ""non-public"" projects contained in the data from the hack, most of which were apparently commissioned by a military unit linked to the FSB. Russia recently broke its record for connections to the Tor browser network, topping 600,000 users on 11 July. BBC Russian reports (in Russian) that there had been just 300,000 users at the start of the year - but the record number has been broken five times since then. The average number of daily users from Russia in the last three months has been more than 400,000.","Hackers who breached a Russian intelligence contractor found that it had been trying to crack the Tor browser and been working on other secret projects, the BBC has learned."
"The decision to halt sales came from HP and Google after owners complained about broken chargers. The two companies have also issued advice to existing owners telling them not to use the charger that came in the box with the computer. Instead, they said, owners should use third-party chargers to keep the gadget going. US reports suggest the machines have been taken off shelves at retailer Best Buy and the gadget can no longer be found in the Google, HP and Amazon online stores. In a joint statement, Google and HP said they had received a ""small number"" of reports from users saying their original charger had been damaged by overheating. The companies said they were now looking into the problem to see what was making the chargers overheat. They apologised to customers for the inconvenience caused by the faulty chargers and added that more information would follow shortly. The statement said that micro-USB chargers that work with other tablets and smartphones should be used instead of the bundled charger. Technology news site Ars Technica noted that this advice would mean that Chromebooks took much longer to charge than they would with the original charger.

"The world's fourth largest phone marker shipped 71 million devices in 2015 - up from 6.6 million in 2012. But it experienced weaker demand in the past 12 months, with third-quarter sales down 27%, according to analysts. Experts say Chinese phone makers are struggling in an increasingly competitive global market. In an open letter to staff, Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun said: ""In the first few years, we pushed ahead too fast. ""We created a miracle, but also drew on some long-term growth. ""So we have to slow down, further improve in some areas and ensure sustainable growth for a long-term future."" 'No profit' Since launching its first phone in 2011, Xiaomi has expanded rapidly, with sales surging to 57.6 million by 2014, according to market trackers IDC. But the privately-held firm only sold 39 million phones in the first nine months of 2016, and its full-year sales are unlikely to match 2015's. The firm, which also sells appliances and runs retail stores, admitted in November it still made no profit from its phones. Francisco Jeronimo, a research director at IDC, told the BBC: ""Chinese phone makers are all facing the same problems. ""The overall smartphone market globally is very tough and not growing, so what they need to do is attract clients away from other brands. ""But they are not that well known, especially outside China, which makes it hard to compete against the likes of Apple and Samsung."" It comes after rival Chinese smartphone business, LeEco, also claimed it had grown too quickly in November. In a letter to his staff, founder Jia Yueting said the company was consequently facing cash-flow problems and difficulty raising funds. Patents Despite Xiaomi's challenges, Mr Jun said he was optimistic about the future. In his letter he claimed the firm's Indian sales hit $1bn (£816m) for the first time in 2016, while sales of its smart appliances reached $2.2bn (£1.8bn). He also said Xiaomi had applied for more than 16,000 patents around the world, of which 3,612 had been granted. ""Only by constant innovation will we be able to introduce breakthrough products in the intensely competitive high-end smartphone market,"" he said.","Chinese mobile phone giant Xiaomi has said it will not disclose how many handsets it sold in 2016 after claiming it had grown ""too fast""."
"The Telecommunications Security Bill bans the involvement of Chinese firm Huawei in the UK's 5G mobile network. But it also says that companies which fail to meet deadlines for higher security requirements could face enormous fines. Some of these could be 10% of turnover, or more than £100,000 a day. Attempts to ban Huawei from the 5G network have been continuing for more than a year. But the new bill is the first step in enshrining such bans in law, and offers details of exactly how it will work - assuming Parliament passes it. The bill provides government with national security powers, allowing it to give instructions to the big telecoms companies such as BT about how they use ""high risk"" vendors including Huawei. But a new measure contained within the draft law is that any companies which do not live up to expectations will face heavy fines for failure. The threatened sum of £100,000 a day would only be used in the case of ""continuing contravention"", the government said. Ofcom, the communications regulator, will be given the job of policing the rules - along with new powers it may need to do so. The move to formally legislate follows months of national and international political wrangling over the company's threat to security and its alleged links to the Chinese state. Initially, the UK decided that Huawei equipment should be removed from the sensitive part of the core network, and only make up a maximum of 35% of the non-core systems. The deadline was set to be 2023. However, amid pressure from the United States, it was revised to order the complete removal of Huawei kit from the entire 5G network by 2027. In recent days, Huawei has commissioned economic research showing that a ban on its 5G equipment will prove a costly setback to the UK's 5G ambitions, and has mounted a publicity campaign with a simple message to the government - you're making a big mistake. The Chinese company seemed to think that the defeat of Donald Trump, whose US administration had lobbied so hard for the ban, might make ministers think again. If so, this bill shows that assumption was wrong, though both Huawei and the mobile operators will be relieved that the government has resisted pressure from some Conservative MPs to move the deadline to remove its equipment forward to 2025. Huawei may also be more focused now on making sure other countries in Europe do not follow the UK's lead. Meanwhile, the mobile operators are getting on with signing new deals with Nokia and Ericsson, and seem to be markedly less vocal in their claims that taking Huawei out of the equation would be a costly catastrophe. ""We are investing billions to roll out 5G and gigabit broadband across the country, but the benefits can only be realised if we have full confidence in the security and resilience of our networks,"" Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. ""This groundbreaking bill will give the UK one of the toughest telecoms security regimes in the world and allow us to take the action necessary to protect our networks."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said the security obligations were likely to include things such as rules on who had access to sensitive parts of the ""core"" network, how security audits were conducted, and protecting customer data. The technical director of the National Cyber Security Centre, Dr Ian Levy, said ""our national networks and operators need to know what is expected of them"". He added: ""We are committed to driving up standards, and this bill imposes new telecoms security requirements which will help operators make better risk-management decisions."" Huawei, however, dismissed such concerns about its own operations. ""This decision is politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks,"" said Huawei vice-president Victor Zhang. ""It does not serve anyone's best interests as it would move Britain into the digital slow lane and put at risk the government's levelling-up agenda.""",A new security law being unveiled on Tuesday threatens telecoms giants with hefty fines if they fail to tighten security.

The Secutablet is compatible with Blackberry 10 and is currently undergoing security certification at the German Federal Office for Information Security. It incorporates IBM's ""app wrapping"" technology which adds extra layers of security to sensitive data. ""Security is ingrained in every part of Blackberry's portfolio, which includes voice and data encryption solutions,"" said Dr Hans-Christoph Quelle, CEO of Secusmart GmbH, a Blackberry company. ""Subject to certification of the Secutablet, German government agencies will have a new way to access Blackberry's most secure and complete communications network in the world."" Blackberry has struggled in the tablet market, and its PlayBook device did not hit sales targets when it was launched in 2010. It acquired German voice and data encryption firm Secusmart, in December 2014, and the Secutablet was unveiled at tech fair CeBit in Hanover at the weekend. ""Historically Blackberry has been strong in Germany because of its high-end security offerings,"" said analyst Nick McQuire, vice-president of enterprise at analyst CCS Insight. 'Very specific' ""Clearly the Secutablet is designed to play into Blackberry's core focus of high grade security. ""The price point is quite expensive - part of the target base is going to be people who can afford to deploy a tablet at that price,"" Mr McQuire added. ""It's aimed at businesses and sectors where security is paramount. Let's not fool ourselves, this is a very limited solution for a very specific area of the marketplace."" There has also been speculation that the device will be Android-powered because of the Samsung hardware. Android speculation ""It is highly likely - but not confirmed - that it will run on Android given that Samsung is a partner, and given Blackberry's focus on becoming more of a cross-platform security company,"" Mr McQuire said. ""One of the things they will want to be known for is to be a mobile security company. Even in the Secusmart business, you can't be entirely platform specific. ""You want to be as secure as you possibly can but you also want to be user friendly."" The Secutablet might face competition from the likes of privacy platform Silent Circle, which unveiled the next generation of its security-focused smartphone Blackphone 2 at Mobile World Congress in March, Mr McQuire said.",Blackberry-owned company Secusmart has unveiled a new tablet in collaboration with Samsung and IBM.
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Google, Research in Motion and thousands of start-ups have offices there as the area positions itself to be the next Silicon Valley. Having an area like this is becoming increasingly important as cities look to tech to help solve problems like congestion and pollution. ""Tech hubs are an important aspect of any city,"" said Bob Crow, managing director of the Institute of Quantum Computing, which is based in the corridor. ""Cities are desperate for cash and many are serving citizens with the same or less money than years ago. There is a built-in need to find ways of economising, whether it be making better use of the streets, or moving people around more efficiently, and cities are looking for technological change."" His own area of research, quantum computing, can offer strides towards these goals. ""Quantum computers and quantum sensors will be used in future and they have a profound ability to look at unstructured data and information which cities are increasingly collecting, and address it quickly,"" said Mr Crow. ""With today's technology we can use sensors to discover that the trash needs to be emptied somewhere and we can find a vehicle to do that. With quantum computing we can talk to all of the bins and all of the bin lorries at the same time and they will tell us where bins need cleaning and we can plan an entire route."" 650 kilometres away in Montreal, the city is looking to artificial intelligence to get the most out of one of its most valuable assets - trees. Earlier this year Infra.AI piloted a program that helped identify ailing trees on city streets. The AI system it developed was shown images of healthy trees and from that was able to identify the ones that the council needed to maintain or replace. ""Trees are worth about half a billion Canadian dollars to the city in terms of how they can help fight air pollution but also increase property prices and general ambience and this kind of proactive tree management is good for the city,"" said Bettina Tratz-Ryan, a smart cities expert at research firm Gartner. As cities collect more data from a range of sources, they need to share it with digital hubs, entrepreneurs and local universities, she said. ""It means these groups can use the city as a test bed for technology. It provides a real setting for their trials, the ability to get data straight away, and it shortens the time for smart implementations."" But Adrian Smith, professor of technology and society at the University of Sussex, thinks cities need to be cautious. ""It is a brilliant idea to open up these problems to a greater diversity of people but unless you have involvement of the neighbourhoods, both in coming up with the challenges and the solutions, then it is just a quick fix,"" he said. London's tech hub - dubbed Silicon Roundabout - is one of the world's most expensive when it comes to the cost of office space, beating those in similar areas in San Francisco, Dublin and Los Angeles. While its rents may be exorbitant, its value to the city is even greater, thinks Scott Cain, the chief business officer of London's innovation hub, the Future City Catapult. ""We think that the role of urban innovation hubs that address the needs of cities is significant - it brings a whole bunch of actors together, from local authorities, to universities, to the health service to transit authorities, to think about the tricky problems facing cities."" He cites three examples. But alongside the innovation, London has also found itself mired in dispute with arguably one of the most innovative firms to enter the capital - Uber - over whether the taxi app firm needs greater regulation. It is a dichotomy which many cities need to wrestle with as they partner with tech firms, thinks Mr Cain. ""It is not just London - cities around the world have to think about being agile in regulation, allowing new business models and creating the conditions for innovative companies. and that is a very hard challenge that city governments are facing.""","The Waterloo corridor, which runs between the cities of Toronto and Waterloo in Canada, is home to coyotes, deer and, increasingly, tech firms."
"In December 2018, owner BT said it would take just two years to remove Huawei equipment from its core network. But it now says ""100% of core mobile traffic"" will be on its new Ericsson-built equipment by 2023, the government deadline announced in January 2020. And it blames the government for also ruling 65% of the network's periphery must be rid of Huawei equipment too. What is the 5G core and why is it important? A mobile phone network's core is sometimes likened to its heart or brain. It is where voice and other data is routed across various sub-networks and computer servers to ensure it reaches its destination. Meanwhile, the network's periphery, its radio access network, includes the base stations and antennas that link individual mobile devices to the core. Read more ""In order to hit these ambitious targets within the timescales laid down by government and to align with their focus on 5G networks, it is now our intention to prioritise migrating our 5G customers to the new Ericsson core, followed by our 4G customers,"" a spokesman said. Meanwhile, the United States continues to pressure officials to ban Huawei outright and dozens of Conservative MPs went against their own party last month in an attempt to do so. Former International Trade and Defence Secretary Liam Fox MP was one of them. Reacting to the delay in removing Huawei from BT's core network, he said: ""Recent events have shown how necessary it is to disentangle China from UK security infrastructure. Any delay will meet with great resistance."" On Tuesday, it was announced former BT chairman Sir Michael Rake had joined Huawei's UK board. He has defended Huawei in recent months, saying further restrictions could damage the UK's relationship with China. Huawei itself has said disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain ""a disservice"".",Huawei's involvement in the most sensitive parts of EE's mobile network is to continue longer than planned.
"It comes months after its users highlighted potential problems with the algorithm, which cropped large photos. The social network's follow-up research has now confirmed the problem. Twitter said it has already started phasing out the older system, with an update to mobile apps that gave more accurate image previews. Under the old system, the algorithm would do its best to centre the view of very tall or wide images in a way that would frame people's faces or other interesting parts of the image. But it did not always work perfectly. Racial bias In September last year, a university employee noticed that when he posted two photos - one of himself and one of a colleague - Twitter's preview consistently showed the white man over the black man, no matter which photo was added to the tweet first. Other users discovered the pattern held true for images of former US President Barack Obama and Senator Mitch McConnnell, or for stock images of businessmen of difference racial backgrounds. When both were in the same image, the preview crop appeared to favour white faces, hiding the black faces until users clicked through to the full photo. Twitter reacted quickly, explaining that it had tested for these kinds of problems with its machine learning system before releasing it - but acknowledged that more work had to be done, and promised a fix. The company revealed the results in a detailed engineering blog post on Wednesday. The problem was with its ""saliency algorithm"" which it released in 2018 to crop images. The algorithm was ""trained on human eye-tracking data"", Twitter explained, but the cause of the apparent issues may be down to several complicated factors. In testing, compared to a 50-50 chance of ""demographic parity"", it found: The team also tested for allegations of the ""male gaze"" effect - where images of women were cropped to the chest or legs rather than a face. But in that instance, the test they ran did not find evidence of bias. ""We considered the trade-offs between the speed and consistency of automated cropping with the potential risks we saw in this research,"" wrote Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of software engineering. ""One of our conclusions is that not everything on Twitter is a good candidate for an algorithm, and in this case, how to crop an image is a decision best made by people,"" she said. She pointed to the recent rollout of a true-to-life crop preview, which also no longer crops ""standard"" 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio photos. ""We're working on further improvements to media on Twitter that builds on this initial effort, and we hope to roll it out to everyone soon,"" she said. In a statement to CNN, a Twitter spokesperson clarified that while the initial change was on mobile apps - where the problem was first reported - the company plans to remove the algorithmic cropping from the website version of Twitter in the coming months.","Twitter's automatic cropping of images had underlying issues that favoured white individuals over black people, and women over men, the company said."
"It means Blackberry users will have to use the mobile version of the website to log on to the social network. It is not clear when this will come into effect. Earlier this month WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, also announced that it would only continue to support Blackberry's Android-powered Priv handset. Whatsapp support for Blackberry's own operating system will end at the end of 2016, the firm said. ""We fought back to work with WhatsApp and Facebook to change their minds, but at this time, their decision stands,"" wrote Lou Gazzola, who works in developer relations at Blackberry, in a blog post.

"Raija Ogden reportedly sustained minor head injuries after the drone's operator lost control of the device. The videographer operating the drone claimed the craft had crashed because an attacker managed to wrest control away from him. The drone was being used to film competitors in the Geraldton Endure Batavia triathlon in western Australia. Ms Ogden was treated at the scene of the accident before being taken to hospital where stitches were required to close a head wound. Hack attack The drone was being piloted by local photographer Warren Abrams who set it hovering about 10m above the race route to capture images of competitors completing the 10km run section of the triathlon. Geraldton Triathlon club has apologised to Ms Ogden who was only metres away from the finishing line when she sustained her injuries. Conflicting reports about the incident have emerged in local media. Some witnesses said the drone fell directly on to Ms Ogden but others said she tripped and fell after being startled by the plummeting device. Mr Abrams told ABC news that video footage shot by the drone clearly showed it missed Ms Ogden and fell just behind her. In later reports Ms Ogden disputed this version of events saying she only sat down as she thought she was going to faint after the craft hit her. The incident is now being investigated by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority whose rules dictate that unmanned aircraft must fly a minimum of 30m away from people. Operators of drones are required to be certified by the agency to fly the unmanned craft. The Agency is now looking into the incident as news reports raised questions about whether Mr Abrams was certified to operate the drone. Mr Abrams said his initial investigation suggested that he lost control after someone else briefly took over flying the drone. Determining who in the crowd of competitors had stolen control would be tricky, he said, because smartphones could easily be used to carry out such an attack.",Australia's air safety body is looking into reports that a triathlete has been injured by a falling drone.
"A petition to save the service, which aggregates news content from web feeds, had 25,000 signatures in a few hours. Experts say shutting Reader is part of Google's plan to migrate more people to its social media service, Google+. Google said in its official blog: ""There are two simple reasons for this - usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we are pouring all of our energy into fewer products."" It added users and developers who wanted to use alternatives could export their data, including their subscriptions over the next four months, using its Google Takeout service. Google Reader launched in 2005, when Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds were a new way to keep tabs on favourite websites and blogs. The news of its demise has led to a debate about the service on Twitter. Some said its launch had effectively destroyed other RSS competitors. Security consultant @cortesi tweeted: ""Google - a destroyer of ecosystems"". In his blog, he added:"" ""Google destroyed the RSS feed-reader ecosystem with a subsidised product, stifling its competitors and killing innovation. ""It then neglected Google Reader itself for years, after it had effectively become the only player."" Adam Leach, a principal analyst at research firm Ovum, said Google's business model was to offer free services in order to draw people into its other offerings. Now, he said, Google wanted people to experience their favourite websites in a more social way and was seeking to migrate its aggregation platforms to its social media service. ""This has been on the cards for a while. It is part of Google's strategy to shift people to Google + and other social tools,"" he said. Doomed to fail He added he would personally miss the service. ""I use Google Reader every day,"" he said. ""It is one of those tools that sits in the background and allows you to keep pace with what is going on.""

"A group that affiliated itself to the loose collective known as Anonymous said it would target official websites. There have been major protests in Brazil against what some have said is an overly extravagant outlay. The Brazilian Army admitted it could not provide complete protection, but insisted it would respond to the most likely threats. ""We are already making plans... I don't think there is much they can do to stop us,"" one activist - who went by the alias Eduarda Dioratto - told the Reuters press agency. The activists reportedly said that the World Cup offered an unprecedented global audience and an opportune moment to target sites operated by world football's governing body Fifa, the Brazilian government and corporate sponsors. 'Fast and damaging' ""The attacks will be directed against official websites and those of companies sponsoring the cup,"" an activist known as Che Commodore said. He added that the most likely tactics would be to launch distributed denial of service attacks, which flood target websites with traffic and cause them to crash. ""It's fast, damaging and relatively simple to carry out,"" Che Commodore told Reuters. He said his colleagues' fire would not be turned on ordinary Brazilians, however. And, despite the government's preparations, the activists said they were confident of success. ""It's nothing out of this world"", said one called Bile Day. ""Security remains very low."" Reuters said it was unable to independently verify the true identities of the people it had contacted online. The tournament is expected to cost about 33bn Brazilian real (£8.4bn), and the level of expenditure has highlighted the inequalities present in Brazil. Kicks off A series of protests during last year's Confederations Cup - seen as a warm-up for this summer's main event - drew more than a million people on to the streets. Brazil's race to get its stadiums ready for the tournament, which kicks off on 12 June, has dominated the headlines so far. But experts agreed that little attention was being paid to the country's telecommunications infrastructure, Reuters reported. The country suffers from overstrained networks, widespread use of pirated software and low investment in online security, as well as a sophisticated domestic cyber-criminal community, which is already disrupting ticket sales and other World Cup commerce. ""It's not a question of whether the cup will be targeted, but when,"" said William Beer, a cyber-security expert with the consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. ""So resilience and response become extremely important."" General Jose Carlos dos Santos, the head of the cyber-command for Brazil's army, said: ""It would be reckless for any nation to say it's 100% prepared for a threat. ""But Brazil is prepared to respond to the most likely cyber-threats."" A Fifa spokesman declined to comment on online security.","Brazilian online activists are threatening to disrupt the 2014 Fifa World Cup, it has been reported."
"Letters sent by seven technology companies to US senators reveal that US authorities found out about the flaws only through the media. Details were first leaked to technology news site The Register on 2 January. The flaws were discovered by Google Project Zero's security researchers. In response to questions posed by Republican congressman Greg Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Google owner Alphabet said it had informed Intel, AMD and ARM about the chip flaws in June 2017. The three semiconductor manufacturers were given 90 days to fix the flaws before disclosing the bugs to the public. Alphabet said it had left it up to the companies to decide whether they should inform government officials about the security flaws, as per standard practice. Intel declined to comment. However, the company's letter to Mr Walden offers more details about what happened. It says that Google Project Zero chose to extend the 90-day timeframe to 9 January 2018, and that Intel had to agree to keep the information confidential until that date. Intel maintains that there is no indication that Spectre or Meltdown were ever exploited, and that it followed the responsible disclosure policies set out by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team.","Computer-chip-maker Intel did not inform US cyber-security officials about the Spectre and Meltdown security flaws before details leaked to the press, it has been revealed."
"It follows numerous reports by consumers that devices have been hacked and abuse shouted at children. Now, New York's department of consumer affairs has launched an investigation - contacting four unnamed baby monitor companies, demanding information about their security and to see evidence of complaints about unauthorised access. Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission issued a similar warning. ""Video monitors are intended to give parents peace of mind when they are away from their children, but the reality is quite terrifying - if they aren't secure, they can provide easy access for predators to watch and even speak to our children,"" said DCA commissioner Julie Menin in a statement. ""Internet-connected devices like video monitors provide convenience - but without proper safeguards, they pose serious privacy risks. We encourage parents to take steps to make sure their devices are secure and call on manufacturers to make security a top priority."" In its report, the FTC said it had looked at five baby monitors and found four of them could be accessed using easy-to-crack passwords. In addition, two of the five did not encrypt the feed between the monitor and the home router and one did not encrypt the feed from the router to the internet. The FTC urged parents to look for baby monitors with ""strong security protocols"" and to choose strong passwords. Sexual noises A net-connected baby monitor sends feeds to a user's home wireless router and then over the internet so that it can be viewed remotely. But hackers have reportedly used them to scream at children or parents or turn the devices into spy cameras.

"It follows the failure of the NHS app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. That app is also based on the toolkit provided by Apple and Google. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused, but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling. ""The Health Minister has commissioned work to develop a proximity app, based on the de-centralised Google/ Apple model, for use in Northern Ireland,"" said the Northern Ireland Department of Health in a statement. ""This work includes examining the interoperability of apps and the sharing of information across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic,"" it said. It added that the Information Commissioner, Equality Commission and NI Human Rights Commission were all involved in exploring ""statutory information governance, equality and human rights issues"", and that their assessments would be published. If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly £12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use.","Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned."
"It comes nearly two years after one of Uber's self-driving cars was involved in a fatal crash in Arizona. Uber scaled back its autonomous car operations following the incident. Receiving a permit in California - which has granted permits to 65 other transport firms - is the latest step in Uber's revival of the programme. California allows companies to test self-driving technology with a backup driver in the car. Before the fatal crash, Uber's self-driving cars were being tested in four locations in North America - Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. 'A critical step' Uber said it is considering using San Francisco, where the company is based, again. It did not give a timeline for when it will resume testing. ""We do not have an update as to exactly when we'll resume autonomous testing,"" the company said in a statement. It added: ""Receiving our testing permit through the California Department of Motor Vehicles is a critical step towards that end in Uber's home city"". California has granted permits to 66 companies in total to test autonomous vehicles, but Uber is the only one that has been involved in a fatal crash. Uber stopped its testing on public roads following a crash in March 2018 that took the life of Elaine Herzberg, aged 49. Ms Herzberg was crossing a poorly lit stretch of a multi-lane road with her bicycle in Arizona when she was struck by a Volvo XC90 using Uber's self-driving technology. An investigation into the crash found the car's backup driver, Rafaela Vasquez, had taken her eyes off the road moments before. Records also showed that she was streaming a television show on her phone during that time. In 2019, prosecutors ruled that Uber was not criminally liable for the crash. An earlier police report said the incident was ""entirely avoidable"". Uber said its self-driving programme ""underwent an overhaul"" following the incident. Uber's self-driving operations resumed in Pittsburgh in 2018. The company also plans to begin testing in Washington DC later this year.

It will report its latest quarterly results on Thursday.",Ride-hailing firm Uber has been issued a permit by the Department of Motor Vehicles in California to test self-driving cars on public roads.
"By Alex HudsonBBC News Do these recent events prove the internet fuels intolerance against homosexuals and bisexuals, or is it the key to gay pride and the catalyst for equal rights? ""It was my first love. It changed my life,"" wrote hip-hop artist Frank Ocean on his blog a fortnight ago. It was the first time he had stated in public that he had had feelings for another man. Before long websites had been created with titles including ""Hate tweets to Frank Ocean"" gathering together responses culled from public posts. While some messages were supportive, many included threats using language that gay communities have cited as homophobic - pledging not to listen to his music and promising to stop following him on social media until he ""stopped being gay"". The ill will followed another controversy sparked by Kraft Foods on Facebook. The US snacks maker had pledged its support for gay pride just over a week earlier with a picture of a cookie with a rainbow-coloured filling on its Oreo marketing page. The post attracted more than 20,000 comments. Many applauded the firm but some swore that they would never buy the biscuit again, that Oreo had no business talking about sexuality and that its effort was ""disgusting"". 'Double standards' Homophobic sentiment is simple to find on the web. Public messages have threatened to put children up for adoption if they were homosexual, discussed teaching a son to ""beat up gays"" and claimed that homosexuality is ""a disease that will kill you"". For a young person struggling to come to terms with his or her sexuality, the gay community thinks that this sort of language, whatever its intent, causes a great deal of harm. ""[The use of the word gay] is the one thing that hasn't changed,"" says Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs at gay equality charity Stonewall. ""98% of young people still hear 'that's so gay, you're so gay'. ""What they tell us is that if they grow up thinking that gay is rubbish, then they realise they are gay, it doesn't make them feel better to know that this word is used and they see double standards."" Some feel it remains too easy for people to post anonymous comments, knowing that efforts will only be made to identify them under the most extreme circumstances. ""It is unlikely the new law will be used frequently,"" Jessica Geen, of Pink News, wrote in 2010 about the introduction of a criminal offence in England and Wales outlawing incitement to hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. ""Similar laws against inciting racial hatred have only been used around 20 times in the 30 years since they came into force."" Grindr capital But while the net provides a forum for prejudicial comments it also offers an opportunity to combat them and enjoy a homosexual or bisexual lifestyle. Kraft noted after its Oreo Pride campaign that ""positive comments have far outnumbered any negative comments"". Search firm Google also recently organised a Legalise Love Conference , while about 400 Facebook staff took part in a San Francisco Pride march. ""Homosexuality is a lot more free than it was 10 years ago,"" says Joel Simkhai, founder of Grindr, a mobile app targeted at gay men, and a homosexual himself. ""The web has been helpful with that."" Grindr is an app that shows photos and information about members in the vicinity of the user, providing a tool to assist meet-ups. London, the company says, has become the app's capital of the world, with 350,000 users. Globally, it says it has over four million members, a quarter of whom are active every day. ""I don't know where I would be if I didn't have the web,"" says Mr Simkhai. ""Maybe I would be 'closeted' longer, maybe I would be married with a woman, there are millions of men that have married women because they couldn't come out. ""For me, the web was so helpful to that process. It empowered me to say 'I'm not different', that's what the web gave me. I suspect it gives that to a lot of people."" No escape? But despite talk of progress some charities remain concerned. ""What young people tell us is that they can't escape on the web,"" says Stonewall's Ms Hunt. ""You get home, you log in and you're trying to do your geography homework and someone's calling you a poof and that's hard. ""It's the fact that there's no respite that's the problem."" A sizeable minority, 23% of homosexuals being bullied have attempted to commit suicide, according to Stonewall's figures. That compares to 7% of the heterosexual community. The internet is easy to use to attack people, something that is often referred to as trolling, whereas finding help online can prove tricky. ""One of the big problems about gay information is that it does not get through firewalls,"" adds Ms Hunt. ""Schools and hospitals block the words 'gay' and 'lesbian'. ""We really want to provide something they can access at school, can access on their smartphone, to counteract all the stuff that's out there that's negative.""",Oreo cookies spark anti-gay online comments and are followed by a homophobic backlash against a rising New Orleans-based star.
"It is a problem with which anyone driving on UK roads in the last three months will be more than familiar. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a smart headlight that can shine ""around"" rain. The idea is that the headlight will be able to predict where rain falls and adjust light beams accordingly. Prototype success Using low-cost, off-the-shelf components the researchers set about developing a system that switches off rays of light that hit raindrops. The smart headlight consists of a projector, camera and beam-splitter. The camera takes images of the raindrops, a processor uses a predictive algorithm to work out where rain will fall, and then the projector switches off light rays that would have normally hit the raindrops. The process from capture to reaction takes about 13 milliseconds. The result is a slightly dimmer headlight, but one that blocks out glare from falling rain and snow. An early prototype, tested in the lab in conjunction with artificial rain, found that the system worked better at slower speeds. The researchers simulated different car speeds and rainfall intensity and found that in severe thunderstorm rain, the system had a 79% success rate in making raindrops invisible when the car travelled at 30km/h, while at 100km/h that fell to around 20%. Carnegie Mellon's computer science professor Srinivasa Narasimhan, part of the team working on the project , admitted that the system had some way to go before it could be used in real cars.",Researchers in the US have come up with a solution to the problem of headlight glare reducing driver visibility in the rain.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter When I spoke to the company's CEO Olaf Swantee last October, he was confident about the strategy: ""We really think we've priced it at the sweet spot,"" he said. ""It's all based on months of consumer research."" But complaints came thick and fast - in particular about data. The fact that customers upgrading from Orange or T-Mobile would pay £5 more for the same amount of data struck many as unreasonable. After all, the whole point of 4G was that lightning-fast speeds meant that you would want to consume far more data. Now EE is going some way to recognise that. Its entry price has been cut from £36 to £31 a month - though you still only get 500MB of data for that. (Incidentally, those who signed up at the original price won't be able to switch to the cheaper deal, which is bound to cause anger.) And it's bringing in a new £46 a month 20GB Sim-only deal designed for what it calls ""super-users"". EE says it has introduced this after ""listening to customers"" but still insists that only a tiny minority - less than 1% - of 4G users have shown a desire to have more than the current 8GB limit. But maybe it's a question of chicken and egg. If the initial prices had not been so high, more people would have signed up and chosen to use more data. That certainly seems to be the message in a report out today from Deloitte that warns mobile networks of an almost insatiable desire amongst smartphone users for data. When I asked EE whether the new price plans were a response to poor uptake of 4G, I was told the company could not disclose any numbers, but had been ""very pleased with the customer response to the launch of EE"". The rest of the mobile industry will be watching this move very closely. With Ofcom's 4G auction starting this month, operators will be wondering just how great the demand from customers is going to be and working out what that means as they bid for spectrum. Last autumn it looked as though EE had pulled off a coup by getting Ofcom to allow it to launch 4G before the rest of the industry. Now it seems the firm may have done its rivals a favour by running a live consumer experiment on their behalf.","Just three months after the launch of the UK's first 4G network, the ""Sale"" signs are going up at EE. The company has unveiled what it describes as ""new price plan offers"" to offer customers more choice. But what EE is actually doing is cutting prices in what looks like an admission that it got its initial offer wrong."
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter He has donated $3m (£2.4m) to the scheme, which is being piloted by the mayors of 16 US cities. He said it was ""one tool to close the wealth and income gap"". The idea of governments paying a basic income to citizens has gained momentum in response to the threat to jobs from artificial intelligence. The premise of universal basic income (UBI) is that every individual in a country will receive a cash payment at regular intervals, without any requirement to work or qualify for it. The payment would be given to every citizen, regardless of wealth or employment status. The US scheme, dubbed Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, is a version of this which would offer a recurring payment, but only to ""some"" residents. On its website, it is not made explicit who will receive payments but it talks of the need to address poverty, particularly in the light of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Covid-19 has only further exposed the economic fragility of most American households and has disproportionately impacted black and brown people,"" it says. ""Mayors will come together in this network to advocate for a guaranteed income - direct, reccuring cash payments - that lifts all of our communities, building a resilient, just America."" There are no firm proposals for how money would be allocated, or for how long the scheme would last. Mr Dorsey tweeted: ""This is one tool to close the wealth and income gap, level systemic race and gender inequalities and create economic security for families"". The project was founded by Stockton mayor Michael Tubbs, who wants it to become a national programme that will extend beyond the current pandemic. He has previously said that raising taxes of individuals such as Mr Dorsey could be one way to fund it. The 29-year-old is attempting to reinvent the Californian city he grew up in and has been experimenting with the idea of a universal income since 2018, paying $500 a month to 125 residents. Joblessness threat Talk of a universal basic income has been around for decades but has become closely associated with the idea of artificial intelligence - the argument being that as robots take over more jobs in society, humans will need a guaranteed annual income supplied by government. But Martin Luther King also suggested the idea in his 1967 book Where Do We Go From Here? AI expert Calum Chace said that a universal basic income could be some way off. ""It is seen by many as a solution to the threat of joblessness as machines automate more and more of our jobs in the coming years and decades,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it is wholly unaffordable if it offers anything more than abject poverty. ""But if, say, [in] a generation from now machines do take most of our jobs, we should all be able to live the lives of leisure that economists like Maynard Keynes promised long ago - if, that is, we can achieve the economy of abundance, where the cost of a very good standard of living falls close to zero. ""The idea of fully automated luxury capitalism is the next big thing, once people understand the limitations of UBI.""","Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has become the first investor in a radical plan to give people a basic income, regardless of job status."
"By Maggie ShielsTechnology reporter, BBC News, Silicon Valley The Federal Communications Commission began the meetings after a court limited its net regulation powers. The FCC faced criticism over the meetings by groups that supported the principle known as net neutrality. The FCC decision follows reports that Google and Verizon hatched a separate deal to allow faster speeds for web sites that pay for the privilege. ""Any outcome, any deal that doesn't preserve the freedom and openness of the internet for consumers and entrepreneurs will be unacceptable,"" said FCC chair Julius Genachowski. Both firms denied they were close to an agreement that many fear would lead to a ""two-tier internet"". Google said: ""We remain as committed as we always have been to an open internet"". In a blog post net service provider Verizon also clarified its position. ""As we said in our earlier FCC filing, our goal is an internet policy framework that ensures openness and accountability, and incorporates specific FCC authority, while maintaining investment and innovation,"" wrote David Fish, executive director of media relations for Verizon. ""To suggest this is a business arrangement between our companies is entirely incorrect,"" he added. Despite the public statements, reports that an agreement will soon be announced persist. During the Techonomy conference in Lake Tahoe, California, Google boss Eric Schmidt would not be drawn on the issue. ""We have been talking to Verizon for a long time about trying to get an agreement on what the definition of what net neutrality is,"" he told reporters. ""We are trying to find solutions that bridge between the hard core 'net neutrality or else' view and the historical telecom view of no such agreement."" Log Jam The issue of net neutrality, which means no data traffic is prioritised over any other, has become a thorny one for the FCC. A recent court case limited the agency's powers to police what happens to data when it ruled that the FCC did not have the power to sanction Comcast for throttling some traffic. As a result the FCC said it would reclassify broadband under a more heavily regulated part of the telecommunications law known as Title II. Cable and phone companies claimed the move would stifle investment in next generation broadband. With the fear that these companies would resort to legal action, the agency began holding what critics termed ""secret negotiations"" aimed at forging a consensus on how to treat internet traffic. The FCC's move to end these talks with firms such as Verizon, Google, Skype and AT&T suggest they broke down without reaching a decision. Edward Lazarus, FCC chief of staff, said the talks had not ""generated a robust framework to preserve the openness and freedom of the internet"". Pay to play Public interest groups believe the Google Verizon tie-up, if it came to pass, would change the very nature of the internet and how it operates ""The deal marks the beginning of the end of the internet as you know it,"" said Josh Silver, president of the Free Press consumer group. ""Since its beginnings, the net was a level playing field that allowed all content to move at the same speed, whether it's ABC News or your uncle's video blog. That's all about to change."" At the Techonomy Conference Mark Carges, chief technology officer of auction site eBay, underlined the company's support for net neutrality. ""eBay supports net neutrality legislation that will prohibit phone and cable companies from replacing the robust open internet with 'Pay to Play' private networks that will force out and discriminate against content and service providers that refuse to pay new tolls,"" Mark Carges told BBC News. ""Consumers, non-profits and businesses already pay for access to the internet,"" he said. ""Broadband providers should not be permitted to 'double dip' by charging consumers twice for high-speed internet access."" Techonomy attendee Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, said she was watching the situation in the US closely. ""We are facing the same types of issues and with our discussions we are consulting everyone,"" said Ms Kroes adding that she was a supporter of net neutrality. ""I know Chairman Genachowski and that he is doing his utmost to find solutions to this issue,"" she said.",US regulators have halted closed-door meetings intended to find a way to make sure all web data is treated equally.
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Respawn Entertainment said it intended to be ""secretive"" about its plans to combat cheating, so as not to forewarn players trying to break the rules. Apex Legends has attracted 50 million players since its release last month. It is often compared with Fortnite, which has 200 million players and was released in July 2017. Both shooter games are in the form of Battle Royale - where players fight against each other until only one survives. In Apex Legends, gamers play in three-player squads rather than as individuals. They pick from one of eight possible pre-defined characters, each with different abilities and roles. Apex Legends also has more realistic graphics than the cartoon-style feel of Fortnite. Legends draws heavily on work that Respawn did on the Titanfall 2 video game. In an update on Reddit, Respawn said it would be adding a report feature which would take players through to anti-cheat platform Easy Anti-Cheat. ""The service works but the fight against cheaters is an ongoing war that we'll need to continue to adapt to and be very vigilant about fighting,"" it said. ""We take cheating very seriously and care deeply about the health of Apex Legends for all players."" Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit told the BBC that cheating on the Windows PC version is more common because it is easier to download a cheat application. ""Reducing cheating is an ongoing process for games publishers and a significant operating cost,"" he said. ""The battle is never won, as new cheats and hacks are appearing all the time. ""Big publishers or developers like Respawn create teams of anti-cheating staff to target cheaters and also work with specialist companies to apply anti-cheating software which is integrated into their client software.""","The 355,000 players caught cheating on Apex Legends were all using the PC version of the game, the studio behind the game has said."
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On Tech Tent we ask what happens next - and in particular will Google start charging phone makers to use Android with an inevitable increase in costs to consumers? Margarethe Vestager, now the most powerful figure in global tech regulation, made clear at her press conference that the fine is just the start of the process. The EU's Competition Commissioner wants action from Google within 90 days to stop controlling which search and browser apps phone makers pre-install on Android phones. But for Google this is a threat to its business model. Its argument is that it gives phone makers and consumers a vibrant but mildly regulated Android ecosystem for free - and to pay for that it has to make some money from search ads. As Ms Vestager was speaking, the firm's chief executive Sundar Pichai came straight out with a blog promising to appeal against the ruling. He explained that Google had invested billions of dollars in Android - but he went on: ""So far, the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology, or depend on a tightly controlled distribution model."" A clear hint that things could change. While Mr Pichai was restrained in his tone, there was a more outspoken response from the trade body that represents US tech firms. Gary Shapiro, President of the Consumer Technology Association, told the BBC that the EU's attitude was bizarre. ""This is a very European, first world problem - to try and deny a service and make something illegal. It hurts people around the world and it's an innovation tax."" He suggested that jealousy of American technology prowess from a continent struggling to produce innovative companies was a motive for the ruling, And then, 24 hours after the ruling, came this tweet from Donald Trump: In the context of the current spat between the EU and the Trump administration over trade, that sounds ominous. But there are three key questions about what happens next. Will Google really start charging manufacturers to use Android? Will the European Commission's ruling suddenly mean consumers switch to other search apps? And will Donald Trump find a way of wreaking revenge on Europe? As far as the first two questions are concerned, it seems unlikely that Google will act to make Android less attractive - after all it makes a huge chunk of its profits from mobile advertising on the platform. We may see Google attempting to appease the EU with some mild changes in its practices - while at the same time employing an army of lawyers and lobbyists to try to get the ruling overturned. And just as it was too late to save Netscape after Microsoft was ordered to stop bundling Internet Explorer with Windows, it is hard to see European phone users rushing to find alternative search engines. As for Mr Trump's plans for retaliation, after 18 months in which he has matched his rhetoric about unfair trade deals with action, it would be foolish to assume he doesn't mean it. Also on the podcast this week:",This week the EU slapped a record fine on Google and ordered it to stop exploiting its control of its Android mobile operating system to crowd out its rivals.
"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The chips are designed for use in low-power devices, including tablets. They incorporate what the US company calls ""3D transistors"", which it introduced to its PC chips in 2012, designed to boost computational power while using less energy. One analyst said Bay Trail could pose a serious challenge to ARM. Unlike Intel, the British company does not make chips of its own but rather makes money by licensing its designs to other companies, including Qualcomm, Apple and Nvidia, which then adapt them for their own uses. ARM's designs currently dominate central processing units (CPUs) used in smartphones and tablets, while Intel's x86-based architecture is far more common in desktop and laptop computers. This has been a consequence of ARM having the reputation of being the more energy efficient of the two. But the new Bay Trail chips may cause some tablet manufacturers to think again, according to one industry watcher, ""I actually do think they have what it takes, but it's not going to be an overnight transition for Intel,"" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. ""It has huge ground to make up against ARM who really still have a stranglehold on the mobile market. ""But this is a great chip on paper for Intel to mount a challenge. Certainly, the fact that it has got backing from the likes of Samsung - who we know is very enthusiastic for the prospects of this chip - I think speaks volumes for its chances in the months to come."" Samsung surprised the tech industry in June when it announced that the 10in (25.4cm)-screened version of its Galaxy Tab 3 tablet featured an Intel chip - Bay Trail's Atom-series predecessor, Clover Trail+. The South Korean firm had previously relied on ARM-based chips made by itself or others to power its Galaxy smart devices. Intel says the new quad-core chips double the computing performance and treble the graphic performance of Clover Trail+. It also introduces the company's Burst Technology 2.0, which can vary which parts of the chip receive the most power to maximise performance without breaching temperature limits. ""You might want to take 15 to 20 photos in a touch application and apply some filters to them to get them ready to post to a blog,"" explained Intel manager Chris Walker. ""That's a situation where you'd be doing less with the display, might not be using the camera at all but you'd need to apply the effects very quickly. The CPU can dynamically adjust for that. ""Now in a different application, maybe a 3D-rich game which is more compute and graphics intensive, what can happen is dynamically the graphics [processing parts] can go up and take power from other areas. It's just responsive to the user."" Mr Walker also highlighted the fact that Bay Trail can support both Android and the full Windows 8 operating systems, allowing manufacturers to offer hybrid tablets that allow their owners to swap between the two environments. ARM-based processors can support Android and Windows RT, however the latter does not support as many applications as Windows 8. Missing ones include the full version of Photoshop and many bespoke programs written for companies. According to a recent study by analytics company Net Applications, Windows RT - which was launched in October - still accounts for less than 0.5% of the global operating system market. Asus recently announced it was stopping making Windows RT tablets because of weak sales and the lack of backwards compatibility. ""I would argue ARM should be very worried,"" said Mr Green. ""Intel has started to wake up and realise they were about to lose this race which is why they have really put their foot down and come back with some interesting products."" However, the British firm is not resting on its laurels. On Tuesday it released a video showing how Samsung's forthcoming ARM-based Exynos 5 Octa chip - which has eight CPU cores - makes use of its Big-Little design while being used to play video game Angry Birds. Big-Little refers to the fact that four of the CPU cores are more powerful but also more power-hungry, while the other four offer less computing power but are less demanding on batteries. According to what the user is doing, different ones can be switched on and off to ensure the owner gets the best mix.",Intel has launched Bay Trail - a family of chips it hopes will help it make further inroads against processors designed by its rival ARM.
"It is thought to be the first large-scale attack on Apple's App Store. The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apple's software for building iOS apps, which they persuaded developers to download. Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information. It added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools. Infected applications includes Tencent's hugely popular WeChat app, NetEase's music downloading app and Didi Kuaidi's Uber-like car hailing app. Some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner CamCard - are also available outside China. ""We've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,"" said Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan. ""We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps,"" said Christine Monaghan. On its official WeChat blog, Tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - WeChat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected. It added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter In Apple's walled garden App Store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen. The company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. Staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security. The Apple App Store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on iOS apps, compared to Google's Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a ""Wild West"" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too). It makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out. Firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied. And secondly, Apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Developers targeted The malware was initially flagged by researchers at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba. It discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode - a tool used to build iOS apps - to a Chinese cloud storage service. Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers. ""In China - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apple's servers,"" explained Palo Alto Networks in a follow-up blog. ""As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources."" It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected. Apple does have a security tool - called Gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run. However, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost. Sense of security Despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products. ""It is definitely embarrassing for Apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of PCs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020,"" Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm Euromonitor International, told the BBC. In fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on PCs, he added. ""In emerging markets like China or Vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted,"" he said. ""Consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues."" Earlier this month, login names and passwords for more than 225,000 Apple accounts were stolen by cyber-thieves in China. It was uncovered by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices. It found a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones. The majority of people affected were in China.",Apple has said it is taking steps to remove malicious code added to a number of apps commonly used on iPhones and iPads in China.
"The European Commission looked into whether the tech giants were meeting a pledge to remove hate speech within 24 hours of it being reported. Only 40% of reports of hate speech are being removed within a day, it found. The pledge was made in May when the firms signed up to a ""code of conduct"" brokered by the Commission. ""The last weeks and months have shown that social media companies need to live up to their important role and take up their share of responsibility when it comes to phenomena like online radicalisation, illegal hate speech or fake news,"" said Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova in a statement. Inciting hate The research tracked what happened to 600 incidences of hate speech reported to the tech firms during a six-week period in October and November. The research covers that period because the monitoring system to track tech firms' responsiveness was set up in early October. Campaign groups and NGOs that monitor racist and fascist movements across Europe used the notification systems on the different social media networks to report these incidences and then tracked how long it took the tech firms to act. Of the 600 reports, 270 were made to Facebook, 163 to Twitter, 123 to YouTube and none to Microsoft. The remainder, seven reports, were made to social media groups that had not signed up to the May pledge. The Commission said the 600 reports were a sample of racist, sexist and misogynist content and did not represent all the examples of hate speech on the tech firms' sites during the six-week study period. About 20% of the messages seen were anti-Muslim and 23% were anti-semitic. In 169 cases the content flagged as being hate speech was removed by the tech firms. YouTube removed 48.5% of the content reported to it, Facebook 28.3% and Twitter 19.1%. In 40% of cases, reports were reviewed with 24 hours, found the research. In a further 43%, the reports were looked at within 48 hours. ""It is our duty to protect people in Europe from incitement to hatred and violence online,"" said Ms Jourova. ""While IT Companies are moving in the right direction, the first results show that the IT companies will need to do more to make it a success.""","Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are falling short of a commitment to tackle hate speech quickly, research suggests."
"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News Three vulnerabilities could be exploited to install malware on users' systems or to hand attackers a measure of control over them, it was reported. Lenovo acknowledged the findings and urged users to download a patch to resolve the issues. The news follows revelations about pre-installed adware on Lenovo systems. The vulnerabilities were discovered by researchers at security firm IOActive, who alerted Lenovo to them in February this year. The patch was released in April, but the researchers' findings were only made public this week. Flaws One flaw would allow both local and remote attackers to ""bypass signature validation checks and replace trusted Lenovo applications with malicious applications"", the researchers found. That might have exposed Lenovo users to so-called ""coffee shop attacks"", in which attackers hijack a connection to a public wi-fi network. The attacker could ""exploit this to swap Lenovo's executables with a malicious executable"", the researchers wrote. The other two flaws would allow attackers to gain a greater level of control over a system than they should have. That would potentially allow them to run malicious commands, according to Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey university. ""Lenovo have been found wanting again on the security front,"" he said. ""They seem to be exposing users to potential remote hacking this time."" 'Very disappointing' Prof Woodward said that, following February's reports that Lenovo had exposed users with adware installed on its systems, the latest revelations were ""very disappointing"". Lenovo was building a ""lamentable record for security"", he added. The firm was forced to remove hidden ""Superfish"" adware that had been pre-installed on its machines, potentially compromising users' security. It offered customers a tool to remove the software, which has been likened to malware in the way it interacts with systems. A Lenovo spokesman said that its development and security teams had worked with IOActive on the vulnerabilities it found in Lenovo's system update feature. The researchers gave Lenovo time to fix the problems before their findings were made public. The computer manufacturer added that users would now be prompted to install the updates. ""Alternatively, users may manually update System Update as described in the security advisory,"" it said. ""Lenovo recommends that all users update System Update to eliminate the vulnerabilities reported by IOActive.""","The Chinese PC manufacturer Lenovo has been accused of running a ""massive security risk"" after researchers found flaws in its software."
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News It generated a big debate about whether parental controls are sufficient, how much responsibility lies with mum and dad - and the ethics of encouraging young players to spend money within games and apps. Following the BBC's report, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson tweeted calling for ""tighter regulation"" in gaming, saying there were ""considerable fears that gaming is a gateway to gambling"". Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS select committee, which is currently investigating technology and addiction, told the BBC he believes the issue is ""a real problem"". ""I think there should be an obligation for the company to warn people about suspicious activity, like large increases in spending, just as banks warn their customers about unusual transactions,"" he said. Here are some of the stories you shared with us. My son spent £3,160 in one game I have a 22 year-old disabled son, who has cerebral palsy, complex epilepsy, autism, learning difficulties and the approximate cognitive ability of a seven-year-old child. He is unable to do any bilateral activities so relies heavily on his iPad and PlayStation for entertainment and educational activities. He has recently been playing a game on his iPad called Hidden Artifacts which involves finding various items and matching them to the description. He has been charged £3160.58 between 18 February and 30 May 2019, clearing out his entire savings. I contacted iTunes, who were extremely helpful but were unable to refund the amount and suggested I contact Blastworks Ltd, the app developer and game provider. [Under European rules, Apple users in the EU can request to cancel an order within 14 days of purchase]. I have phoned and emailed several times but have had no response. It is extremely distressing that vulnerable people, such as my son, become victims of what is thought to be an educational game. I have tried tirelessly to recoup his life savings but constantly come up against a brick wall. Susie Breare, Hampshire Basketball game cost our family £2,000 My 16-year-old son spent nearly £2,000 of my money on EA's NBA basketball game. He used my bank card and I didn't realise until I had a payment declined. He accessed the app via Google Play. EA made no response to me and Google Play has a disclaimer about kids using parents' bank details without permission. My daughter had to use her university savings to pay the bill for this and it has caused huge damage to our family. Susan Taylor, Scotland Our son spent £700 on Clash of Clans This happened to us a few years ago when we were very new to all this. We are technically savvy but didn't think to put a password on and my son, who was 12, ended up spending around £700. It was on his own phone and he managed to download Clash of Clans through a Google Play account, enter his own children's bank card details and buy lots of in-game items. We didn't realise until we checked his bank statement and it was virtually empty. He did not realise the connection, that it was real money leaving his bank account. We never got our money back, apart from a token amount as a gesture of goodwill. Anon, West Sussex My daughter installed the same game three times My 11-year-old daughter has spent over £100 of my money in a day downloading apps that are the same. I had Google Play blocked from accessing money from my account but recently they changed settings that somehow allowed my girl to spend money unauthorised. I had to contact the fraud team on three occasions to get money back. The games my daughter was installing were horse games and Minecraft. She installed the same game three times. I had no idea until I found my bank account was empty and checked my online statement. My daughter is now [using] a closed system back on a PS3. No fraud, no online grooming and no bullying. Julia Pennycuick, Edinburgh ""He was completely inconsolable"" I installed Mini Golf King on my phone for my son who is five. He knows he's not allowed to spend money in games, yet this game successfully tricked him into spending £300 on in-app purchases. Fortunately, my card issuer blocked some of the transactions, but a purchase for £75 went through, along with a few smaller ones. When my son realised that he'd spent real money, he was completely inconsolable, saying he was so sorry for being naughty and he thought they were pretend coins. My refund request via Google Play was automatically rejected. I explained that my son is autistic, and his disability makes him vulnerable (he doesn't really understand the concept of being manipulated and he wouldn't necessarily understand why people who make games want money). Google said I should contact Mini Golf King, which said it did not generally refund in-app purchases once the purchased items had been used. It offered to delete the account and submit a refund case to the store from which the purchases had been made, but said this would be non-reversible. I have heard nothing since. People will say ""well, you should be supervising him"". I was! I was in the room. But the game is a children's game, rated PEGI 3 [suitable for players aged three and above]. I would allow him to watch a U-rated film and I assumed PEGI 3 games were safe to play with casual supervision. Claire, West Yorkshire My boy spent almost £1,000 on Fortnite When he was 15, my boy spent almost £1,000 on Fortnite. The issue was it was small cumulative amounts that don't seem significant until you add them up over eight months. He doesn't have Fortnite any more... and my car will be clean for the next 15 years! Naz, Dubai Our daughter's ""free trial"" cost £93 Last week my wife got a suspicious email from PayPal, £93 for some mobile app that takes a photo and converts it to a 3D emoji. I checked my online banking app and sure enough the money for a ""free"" trial had been taken. It turned out my wife had left herself logged into Google Play on her old phone that she'd given to our youngest daughter, who had signed up for the free trial, which after a week expired and took the funds. Thankfully Google were very quick to refund the amount, within 30 minutes of raising the issue with them. Damian Cox, Leicestershire Google told the BBC that it advises parents to set up its Family Link tool. ""This gives you the ability to set various types of permissions per person in the family,"" said a spokesman. ""For example, you can use password protection so that a password needs to be entered each time a purchase is made, including for in-app purchases billed by Google Play, like buying coins in games."" The BBC also contacted Blastworks, EA, Mini Golf King and Supercell for comment. Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, from IHS Markit, said that 56% of consumer spending on games in the UK is forecast to be on micro-transactions, in-app purchases and paid downloadable content (outside of full games) in 2019. ""It is clear that there need to be safeguards for younger players,"" he said. ""Educating parents around controls that can be used on devices to help mitigate these incidents occurring, and awareness of age rating for content, is a good starting point. ""I'd also like to see the industry self-regulate to do more to safeguard younger players and overuse of games.""

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The program - Moments - was released in some countries in 2015, but withheld elsewhere because of local data privacy rules. The company has created a different version of the software to get around these restrictions. But it acknowledged the new edition required ""a little bit of work"" for users to get the most out of it. Moment's core features are that it automatically groups together photos featuring the same friend or friends, and then makes it easy to share the pictures with them if they have installed the same app. In the original version, the snaps are automatically tagged with people's names, because Facebook is able to match them to other photos in its wider database. But data protection watchdogs in the EU and Canada had expressed concern their citizens would have no way to opt out of the process. To address this, the adapted app now links together photos of similar-looking faces but requires the user to identify who they are. Moments is not the only app to use facial recognition to sort images. Google Photos is the most popular alternative to do so. But the search giant has yet to extend the facility to Europe, to avoid falling foul of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. 'Private' sharing Facebook has not disclosed how many people have signed up to Moments since its release on the US's iOS and Android stores 11 months ago. However, the company has said more than 600 million pictures have been shared via the app so far. ""Our primary purpose is to solve a problem that we know that people have, where they never get the photos that their friends take of them,"" the app's product manager Will Ruben told the BBC. ""We view that as a pretty different type of sharing than might happen on Facebook, where people share photos more broadly with a large group of friends or even publicly. ""Moments is closer to the type of sharing that might happen these days on Whatsapp or other [private] messaging apps - but it places the photos together into a collection."" Users decide which photos are shared with the people labelled in them, and can withdraw access at a later point. They can also use the app to turn selected photos into slideshows that can be shared to their Facebook wall and elsewhere. Local matches The technique - which Facebook refers to as ""facial clustering"" - still relies on some processing being done beyond the user's handset, but Facebook said it had taken great lengths to comply with the EU and Canada's privacy rules. ""A cropped low-resolution of the photo is uploaded [to the cloud] so that your phone gets a numerical representation of that face,"" Mr Ruben said. ""But that number is not stored anywhere on our servers, and it is only used to compare against the other photos on your phone. ""No comparison is being done on the server."" Copies of the images are, however, stored at Facebook's data centres as soon as they are shared with someone else. ""Facebook has notified this office of the Moments app and advised us that within the EU version of the Moments app they do not control or initiate the use of any feature recognition technology,"" said a spokeswoman for the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. ""Consideration of this development is ongoing and we will more closely look at the technical details of the app following its release."" Limited labelling Mr Ruben said Facebook believed the original version of Moments remained the ""best version"" but the new edition was still ""easy to use. ""You don't need to label all the faces on your phone,"" he said. ""The idea is to share with the people closest to you, so usually it's just the top 10 people or so."" One industry-watcher said the lack of auto-tagging might slow the app's adoption. ""Any additional effort that people have to put into a service creates a barrier,"" said Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight. ""The seamless experience in other markets is therefore more compelling. ""However, once people invest a little time, they will see the benefits, and it could catch on, on that basis."" Facebook's use of facial recognition has, however, caused controversy in the US. Last week, a US judge refused to block a class action case in which it is claimed the technology violates Illinois's Biometric Privacy Act. The law states biology-based identifiers - including facial maps and fingerprints - cannot be collected without their owners' explicit consent. Google is also being sued over the matter.",Facebook has launched its facial-recognition-powered photo-sharing app in the EU and Canada.
"The event is part of an unprecedented international inquiry into disinformation and fake news. Richard Allan, Facebook's vice-president of policy solutions, appeared in Mr Zuckerberg's place. He said he took responsibility for deciding who appeared at which committee. The session was attended by parliamentarians from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Latvia, and Singapore as well as members of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Its chairman Damian Collins, has repeatedly asked Mr Zuckerberg to attend hearings. Lord Allan, who is also a Liberal Democrat peer, faced a grilling on various Facebook policies and actions in addition to the subject of why his boss wasn't there. ""We've never seen anything quite like Facebook, where, while we were playing on our phones and apps, our democratic institutions... seem to have been upended by frat-boy billionaires from California,"" remarked Canadian politician Charlie Angus. It had been thought that a cache of Facebook documents, seized by MPs from a US businessman on the grounds that they were relevant to the inquiry, might be shared - but Mr Collins said that they would not be published today. He later said that they will be published - possibly in the next week. Lord Allan said he believed it would be unfair to take ""internal conversations"" and ""robust comments"" as the company's official position. The Observer, which first reported the story about the documents being seized, said they included data about Facebook's privacy controls. They had been sealed by a US court, and Facebook has demanded their return. However, the contents of one email from 2014 were alluded to, in which a Facebook engineer reported unusual levels of Russian activity - namely that huge amounts of data were being pulled daily from devices with Russian IP addresses. Lord Allan was asked whether any action was taken, or authorities notified. He said the information he had was ""partial at best"" and that he would have to come back with more details. Facebook has since responded that its engineers had looked into the matter at the time and ""found no evidence of specific Russian activity"". The BBC understands that the data calls turned out to be legitimately coming from the social media platform Pinterest, and that there were not billions of them as suggested in the hearing. App bans Lord Allan was unable to name a single occasion when Facebook had banned an app for breaking its rules, despite saying that it was Facebook's policy to do so. In a later session, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the hearing that Facebook informed her it had banned 200 apps during the summer of 2018. ""I'm not aware of any case before the revelation [of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal]"", she said. Lord Allan also acknowledged that Facebook had ""damaged public trust"" through some of its actions and said the firm was in favour of a ""regulatory framework"" for the social media giant.",Politicians from nine countries reacted angrily to the absence of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing today.
"By Joe MillerBBC News Jack Dorsey tweeted the account on Tuesday, asking: ""Are citizens of Iran able to read your tweets?"" The reply said he was working to ensure they would ""comfortably b able 2 access all info globally as is their right"". Mr Dorsey replied: ""Please let us know how we can help to make it a reality."" Sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are banned in Iran, although many Iranians bypass restrictions using virtual private networks (VPNs). Authorship debate Iran's new administration, which came to power in August, has taken to social media, using it as a diplomatic tool to engage with the rest of the world. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has an active Facebook page, as does Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh. Mr Rouhani, whose campaign slogan was ""moderation and wisdom"", has had a presence on Twitter since running for election. He made headlines for apparently posting a New Year message to Iranian Jews, and for chronicling his recent groundbreaking telephone conversation with US President Barack Obama. But there has been some confusion over who is actually operating Mr Rouhani's Twitter account. The president's Twitter handle has not been authenticated by Twitter, which puts a blue tick on profiles it confirms are genuine. After Mr Rouhani's Jewish New Year tweet, his office told reporters that the account was controlled by those close to the president but that he did not personally author the tweets. The BBC's Persian service said that exclusive pictures and news alerts tweeted by Mr Rouhani's account suggested it was run by the people in close proximity to Iran's president. Critics have claimed Iran's reformist politicians are being intentionally vague about who controls their social media accounts, so they can disavow messages that anger hardliners. Towards reform The Iranian president has previously voiced his opposition to Iran's internet censorship, but does not have the lone authority to lift the ban. Iranians were briefly granted access to Facebook and Twitter last month, but authorities claimed the incident was a technical glitch. However recent developments have indicated that Iranian authorities are easing their grip on internet censorship. Iranians accessing a filtered website without using a VPN used to be confronted with a message notifying them that the site had been filtered for ""criminal"" content. Now, all surfers get is an index page with links to domestic websites and a ""no access"" message.","A Twitter account used by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has exchanged tweets with Twitter's chairman, fuelling speculation Iran's social media ban might be lifted."
"The clips, known as deepfakes, typically use the features of female TV personalities, actors and pop singers. Unlike some social networks, Twitter allows hardcore pornography on its platform. But it said deepfakes broke its rules against intimate images that featured a subject without their consent. The San Francisco-based company acted six hours after a Twitter account dedicated to publishing deepfake clips was publicised on a Reddit forum. News site Motherboard was first to report the development. ""We will suspend any account we identify as the original poster of intimate media that has been produced or distributed without the subject's consent,"" Twitter told Motherboard. It added that ""deepfakes fall solidly"" within the type of clips banned by its intimate media policy. The development followed an announcement by Pornhub that it too would remove deepfake clips brought to its attention. Until now, the adult site had been a popular source for the material, with some deepfake videos attracting tens of thousands of views. Video-hosting service Gfycat and chat service Discord had already taken similar action. Simple software Deepfakes involve the use of artificial intelligence software to create a computer-generated version of a subject's face that closely matches the original expressions of another person in a video. To do this, the algorithm involved requires a selection of photos of the subject's face taken from different angles. In cases where the two people involved have similar body types, the results can be quite convincing. The practice began last year, but became more common in January following the release of FakeApp - a tool that automates the process. It requires only a single button click once the source material has been provided. One Reddit group dedicated to sharing clips and comments about the process now has more than 91,000 subscribers. Child abuse Not all of the clips generated have been pornographic in nature - many feature spoofs of US President Donald Trump, and one user has specialised in placing his wife's face in Hollywood film scenes. But most of the material generated to date appears to be explicit. While the vast majority of these feature mainstream celebrities, some users have begun generating clips using the faces of YouTube personalities in recent days, a move that has proved controversial with others. In addition, there has been a backlash following reports that some people had created illegal child abuse imagery by using photos of under-16s. ""I saw one... of some little girl from a TV show and told the original poster to take it down,"" reported one Reddit member. Users are also being warned not to try to buy or sell specially commissioned deepfake videos among themselves. Motherboard revealed one advert for such a service earlier this week, noting that any commercial activity could put those involved at risk of being prosecuted. More realistic Some of the clips being created already rival the quality of face-swapping special effects used in films, including Rogue One and Blade Runner 2049. And efforts are being made to make further improvements. A page on the Github code-sharing site reveals that work is being done to make eyeball movements ""more realistic and consistent"" with those of the person featured in the original footage. In addition, attempts are being made to: Some users have also begun exploring the use of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform as an alternative to trying to generate the clips on their own computers. Such a move has the potential to make it possible to generate longer videos without having to wait days, but would involve having to pay the services a fee for their processing efforts.",Twitter is the latest platform to ban a new type of pornographic video that replaces the original actor's face with that of another person.
"Chad Hurley and Steve Chen will use Delicious as a key part of their next net venture called Avos. The startup is thought to be based around tools that help people get to grips with the vast amount of information generated by web sites and services. How much the pair paid to acquire Delicious has not been revealed. Data deluge Delicious describes itself as a social bookmarking system in which members flag and tag sites, articles and media they find interesting. These can then be shared with other Delicious users. Its name derives from its desire to find the ""tastiest"" bookmarks on the web. Delicious was acquired in 2005 by Yahoo and in late 2010 the web giant decided to sell it off or close it down if no buyer came forward. Now Mr Hurley and Mr Chen have acquired Delicious to form part of the technology underpinning their new firm Avos. Details about Avos and what it will do are scant. A statement from Chad Hurley following the Delicious acquisition said the company will aim to help people manage the information gushing from the web services they use. ""We see a tremendous opportunity to simplify the way users save and share content they discover anywhere on the web,"" Mr Hurley said. The pair sold YouTube to Google in 2006 for $1.76bn (£1.06bn). Steve Chen left YouTube in 2008 and Mr Hurley quit working for Google in late 2010. Delicious will continue in its current form until July 2011.

Open AI says it expects its research - free from financial obligations - to focus on a ""positive human impact"". Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity. Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that AI was humanity's ""biggest existential threat"". Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially ""re-design itself at an ever increasing rate"", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.

"By Chris FoxTechnology reporter The Bloomsbury Patient Network provides information and support for people who are HIV-positive. But twice in 2014, staff emailed up to 200 members at a time without obscuring other patients' email addresses. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had levied a fine that would not cause ""financial hardship"". Data breach In February 2014, a member of staff at the Bloomsbury Patient Network emailed up to 200 patients who were HIV-positive. The email addresses were entered into the ""To"" field, meaning they were visible to everybody who received the email. Instead, email addresses should have been entered into the ""BCC"" field, which would have obscured them from other recipients. In May 2014, the same member of staff repeated the error. Serious error The ICO said 56 of the 200 email addresses contained the full or partial real names of patients. Considering the subject matter of the email message, it ruled that was a serious breach of data protection laws. But the amount of the fine was mitigated by the ""significant impact on BPN's reputation as a result of this security breach"". A spokesperson for the BPN told the BBC: ""We have paid the fine without making any appeal, acknowledging that our old mailing system was flawed in its potential for human error."" ""We were in the process of changing systems when the breach in question occurred and we have since been using a secure and anonymous mailing system."" Continuing investigation Another HIV support group, 56 Dean Street, in London, made the same mistake with an email sent in September 2015. It exposed the names and email addresses of 780 people when a newsletter was issued. The ICO told the BBC its investigation into that incident was continuing. Fines for breaches of data protection can reach £500,000. ""No matter how big or small an organisation is, when dealing with sensitive information, policy, procedure, training, and supervision must be in place to reduce the probability of human error occurring,"" said Shaun Griffin, executive director of external affairs for Terrence Higgins Trust, an HIV charity which was not implicated in the ICO ruling. ""Incidences such as these are rare, and should not put anybody off getting a test for HIV. Nearly one in six people with HIV does not realise they have it,"" he said.",A health clinic that mistakenly revealed the identity of HIV-positive patients in a group email has been fined £250 by the UK's data watchdog.
"In that attack, gigabytes of files including emails and other documents that revealed the inner workings of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were taken. Technical evidence has now come to light suggesting Guccifer 2.0 has links with Russia, compounding theories that the hack was state-sponsored. What's the evidence on both sides? Who is Guccifer 2.0? We do not know the identity of the real person behind this hacker alias. It is a pseudonym adopted by someone who claims responsibility for the recent hack attack on the DNC - the organisation that oversees the running of the US Democratic party. Whoever is behind Guccifer 2.0 is not thought to be connected to the original Guccifer, who is currently in a US jail awaiting sentencing on hacking and fraud charges. Guccifer 2.0 also claims to be Romanian and, via a blog, has said they have been working alone. Many people are sceptical about these claims and others made on that blog. So who was Guccifer 1.0? Guccifer was the alias adopted by Marcel Lehel Lazar who, from 2013 onwards, targeted high-profile Americans, many of them politicians, and sought to hack into their personal email and social media accounts. In January 2014, Lazar was arrested in Romania on hacking offences and was given a four-year jail term. In March 2016, he was extradited to the US to face trial on a variety of hacking and fraud charges. In May 2016, while in jail, he told Fox News that he had repeatedly broken into a private email server set up by Hillary Clinton that handled her electronic correspondence. Ms Clinton has denied the server was hacked and the US State Department said it could find no evidence supporting Lazar's claim. Lazar said the Guccifer name comes from simply combining the Italian fashion brand Gucci with the name the Bible gives to the devil, Lucifer, before he was cast out. Why are many sceptical about the identity of Guccifer 2.0? For three main reasons: Has Guccifer 2.0 responded to these claims? Yes. The person claiming to be the hacker has openly mocked the different analyses and repeated their assertion that they are Romanian and have no backing from the Russian state. However, in interviews with the media, Guccifer 2.0 did not seem to speak Romanian well. A closer look at their responses using linguistic analysis tools suggested they were using a sentence structure heavily influenced by Russian rather than Romanian which draws its roots from Latin in the same was as the French and English languages. Does this prove that Russia is involved? No. Attribution, the experts say, is always difficult. Translated, this means nobody knows who to blame. One of the first lessons that any competent hacker or hacktivist learns is how to cover their tracks and how to use proxies, encryption and other techniques to obscure who they are and from where they are operating. Could a 'lone wolf' hacker have done this? Yes. It is entirely possible that an individual broke into an organisation and stole a lot of information. It happens all the time. Tools to carry out hacks and videos educating people about how to use them are easy to find online. But as repeated breaches have shown, sometimes it does not take technical ability to get into a supposedly secure network - anyone stubborn enough to keep trying commonly used passwords might eventually succeed. However, the DNC hack does not share some of the characteristics of other hacktivist attacks. Politically motivated hackers tend to release documents as soon as they get hold of them because they want to embarrass the target. By contrast, state-sponsored hackers are much more likely to lurk inside a network for months and slowly steal data over time. Why would Russia do this if indeed it is behind the attacks? Russia and China are both well known for running large-scale cyber-espionage operations. Information taken in these attacks is often used to help diplomatic and commercial negotiations and to further their own ends.",A lone hacker calling themselves Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for a damaging hacking attack on the US Democratic Party.
"The designs have been presented to the Unicode consortium, the body that approves and standardises emojis. The team said that they hoped the samples would ""empower young women (the heaviest emoji users) and better reflect the pivotal roles women play in the world"". It includes healthcare workers, scientists and businesswomen. Fierce professionals Emojis are icons that are increasingly being used in mobile and web messaging to help tell a story. The term - which means picture (e) and character (moji) in Japanese - was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013. The team of four Google employees cited a New York Times op-ed called ""Emoji Feminism"" as the motivation for its new designs. ""Where, I wanted to know, was the fierce professional working her way to tenure? Where was the lawyer? The accountant? The surgeon?"" asks Amy Butcher in the piece. ""We are told we are the new generation of American women; no longer a minority, we are, in fact, the majority of breadwinners in American homes. And yet the best we can get is the flamenco [dancer]."" Ballerina v disco-dancer Research by Procter & Gamble suggested that 82% of girls aged 16-24 use emojis every day. More than half of those surveyed thought that female emojis were stereotypical. Google's designs include women in technology, construction, farming and the food industry. The female musician emoji includes a homage to the late David Bowie - with a pink zig-zag on her face. Users can already select from different skin tones as well as the generic yellow on some devices. Recently Emojipedia, a search engine for emojis, proposed that you should also be able to choose the colour of hair and specify gender. All emojis need to be approved by Unicode to make sure that they display properly across the different platforms. However, emojis can look very different on competing platforms - a dancer emoji for instance shows up as a ballerina on LG phones, a man disco-dancing on Samsung devices, a yellow blob with its arm raised on Android and a flamenco dancer on iOS. The next batch of emoji candidates is due to be released mid-year but it is unclear whether Google's designs will be approved in time to be included in this.",Google engineers have designed a set of 13 emojis that they say better represent women in the world of work.
"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter LG showed off a set that can be fitted almost flat against a wall while Samsung teased a new kind of TV - designed to look like a painting - that displays art when not in use. Samsung also unveiled a flagship set boasting greater brightness levels than before. Others, including Sony, also revealed new models. Samsung's flagship 75in (190cm) QLED 4K TV features the latest version of its quantum dot technology - tiny particles that emit different colours of light. These now feature a metal material that the firm says allows for better colour reproduction. Samsung has decided to stick with a curved display for its high-end models - despite criticism from some experts that viewing angles suffer with such designs. 'Insanely bright' The QLED TV can achieve HDR (high dynamic range) brightness of between 1,500 and 2,000 nits - one nit equalling the light from a candle. ""It's insanely bright,"" said Jack Wetherill, a tech analyst at Futuresource. ""That is pretty power hungry one would imagine, but if they're going down the route of getting as good a picture as they can out of it, then fair enough."" This sets it apart from other set makers who use another premium TV screen technology, OLED (organic light-emitting diode). Such screens use a carbon-based film allowing the panel to emit its own light, rather than being backlit - this enables the ultra thin designs. Quantum dot TVs might not be able to display the deepest blacks possible with OLED, but they are generally brighter. LG's new OLED 4K TV was as thin as last year's - just 2.57mm thick - and will be available in 65 and 77in models. But the firm has now designed a new mount that uses magnets so the set can be fixed flat against a wall, which the firm says means it doesn't cast ""a single shadow"". HDR ready LG also announced its latest TVs would support four HDR formats - including Hybrid Log-Gamma jointly developed by the BBC and the Japanese broadcaster NHK. This will allow sport and other live broadcasts to be shown in the format. Many experts agree that HDR makes a huge difference to the TV picture, making it seem richer and allowing for higher levels of contrast between light and dark tones. ""It is more vibrant, the colours are more distinctive,"" said Mr Wetherill. ""It does bring a much more impressive and immersive experience - no question about that."" It is not yet clear which format will become popular with content-makers, so LG's inclusion of all four should ensure it does not become obsolete if and when a winner emerges. Samsung also showed off images of its new Lifestyle TV, which it described as ""a beautiful, always-on, truly smart display that transforms the TV to art"". It comes in a wooden frame, in an attempt to look like a painting. Sony also announced a new 4K OLED TV - its first - the latest in its Bravia range. As well as an HDR processor that can upscale standard dynamic range content to ""near 4K HDR quality"", the set has also dispensed with in-built speakers. Instead, it emits sound via vibrations produced on the surface of the screen itself. This wasn't demonstrated at the press conference, noted Mr Wetherill, but it was, he said, ""an interesting concept"". Panasonic did not discuss its OLED TV plans at its press conference, though it is possible a prototype will be on the CES trade show floor. At last year's consumer electronics show IFA in Berlin, the company had said it would release details of the TV during the winter.

"Several companies have criticised the law, which would hold them accountable for not removing copyrighted content uploaded by users, if it is passed. EU member states have until 7 June 2021 to implement the new reforms, but the UK will have left the EU by then. The UK was among 19 nations that initially supported the law. That was in its final European Council vote in April 2019. 'Terrible for the internet' Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. The EU Copyright Directive that covers how ""online content-sharing services"" should deal with copyright-protected content, such as television programmes and movies. It refers to services that primarily exist to give the public access to ""protected works or other protected subject-matter uploaded by its users"", such as Soundcloud, Dailymotion and YouTube. It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral - since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would make it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law in 2019 made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticised the law in March, claiming that it was ""terrible for the internet"". Google had campaigned fiercely against the changes, arguing they would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"" and ""change the web as we know it"". YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki had also warned that users in the EU could be cut off from the video platform. Kathy Berry, a professional support lawyer at Linklaters, welcomed the government's stance on the law, claiming it will ""allow the UK to agree to more tech-friendly copyright provisions in free trade deals with other countries"". The law sparked suggestions from its biggest critics that it would end up ""killing memes and parodies,"" despite it permitting the sharing of memes and GIFs.",Universities and Science Minister Chris Skidmore has said that the UK will not implement the EU Copyright Directive after the country leaves the EU.
"By Sam SheadTechnology reporter The issue is GPS-related and it prevents the camera-carrying drones from starting. The drone was discontinued in 2018. However, GoPro pledged to keep supporting existing machines with the necessary software updates. A GoPro spokesperson told the BBC that the company has identified the issue. ""We've identified the cause of this issue, are in the process of implementing and testing a fix, and expect to release a firmware update for Karma that will address the issue within the week,"" they said. ""We apologise to anyone who was inconvenienced by this issue."" Tech website The Verge reported that the issue is linked to the recent GPS clock ""rollover"" phenomenon, which happens once every 1,024 weeks, or every 19.7 years. Software needs to be programmed to anticipate the rollover to zero weeks, otherwise it may stop working. The majority of tech firms have averted problems with software updates over the last few months but GoPro has not updated Karma's software since September 2018. GoPro Karma owners started complaining about the issue last Thursday. ""I recently got a Karma and am having an issue with compass calibration,"" wrote a GoPro owner on a forum. ""For some reason this doesn't work: as soon as I select compass calibration in the controller, within half a second (not enough time to pick up the drone and start calibrating), I get the message 'calibration failed, try again'. ""It also gives a message about not being able to calibrate the compass without a GPS signal."" Another owner said they had the same problem and it was stopping them working. The backpack-sized Karma drone, which has a dedicated slot for the company's Hero action cameras, was launched by GoPro in September 2016. The product, which competes with DJI's camera drones, proved popular with snowboarders, surfers, and other extreme sports enthusiasts who want to film themselves performing from the air. Some YouTubers and Instagrammers also bought the device, which retailed for £720 at launch. However, shortly after the devices went on sale, some owners complained about them losing power mid-flight, causing the Karma to plummet uncontrollably to the ground. GoPro issued a global recall for the Karma drone in February 2017 while it tried to address the issue. In January 2018, GoPro announced that it intended to exit the drone business and it laid off hundreds of staff who worked on Karma. At the time, it said it would continue to provide service and support Karma customers.",GoPro's first and only drone - the Karma - has been grounded by a technical glitch.
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Instead, it is building software for developers to help them mix graphics with real-world views using common camera and motion-tracking hardware. The rethink brings it in line with rival Apple's mixed-reality strategy. By coincidence, Apple has just unveiled several in-development AR apps for iOS. They include: All of the third-party apps have been developed since Apple unveiled its ARKit software at its WWDC developers conference 12 weeks ago. The products will be released to the public once Apple releases the iOS 11 version of its mobile operating system. However, the processor demands of the software mean that users will not be able to run the AR apps on iPhone 6, iPad Air 2 or earlier products. Although the AR-themed Pokemon Go has already proved popular on iOS, ARKit helps anchor objects to locations and makes it easier to take account of lighting conditions, among other benefits. Google has named its competing software development kit ARCore. A video published on YouTube shows it being used to superimpose cartoon objects on a tabletop and street, and it has animated characters reacting to real people and pets. A test version has already been released that runs on Google's Pixel phones and Samsung's Galaxy S8 handsets. Google blogged that it was also working with Huawei, LG, Asus and others to bring it to further handsets. ""We're targeting 100 million devices at the end of the preview,"" it added. Until now, Google's AR efforts have focused on Project Tango - an initiative that used an infrared projector and sensor to take depth measurements. However, despite being announced more three years ago, only two products incorporating the technology have gone on sale to the public - the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and the Asus ZenFone AR. Neither of the phones have been best-sellers and partly as a result few app developers have been attracted to the platform. Although Google says that ARCore was ""built on"" Tango, the news site Ars Technica has reported that the newer technology was created by a different team of engineers who were being given access to a lot more resources. ""Apple is about to get about 500 million people into AR all in one quarter thanks to iOS 11,"" Robert Scoble, a mixed-reality consultant at the Transformation Group, told the BBC. ""This represented a real threat to Android and Google has responded with a fairly interesting effort with ARCore. ""But I hear there's another shoe to drop on 12 September when we expect to see Apple announce new iPhones. This battle is just beginning.""",Google has switched tack in its effort to popularise augmented reality (AR) on Android by moving away from a requirement for devices to be fitted with special depth sensors.
"It follows its historic win against Lee Se-dol last year, described by experts as a breakthrough moment for AI. The AI won by just half a point in its latest match. Ke Jie described the AI as ""like a god of Go players"", while DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis thanked him for a hard-fought match. ""It was a such close game, an exciting game and showed how much work Ke Jie put into preparing for the match,"" said Mr Hassabis in a post-match press conference. ""It was interesting for us to see him using moves from AlphaGo's previous games, and we were intrigued to see how AlphaGo deals with its own strategies used - huge respect to Ke Jie for pushing AlphaGo to its limits."" He added that the ultimate plan for AlphaGo was a wider deployment ""in areas of medicine and science"". Of the match, Ke Jie said: ""There were some unexpected moves and I was deeply impressed. ""I was quite shocked as there was a move that would never happen in a human-to-human Go match."" He added that AlphaGo was a ""wonderful player"" and ""completely different"" from last year. AlphaGo now has huge influence on the Go circuit, and was star turn at the Future of Go Summit, organised by Google, in China this week. The second game will take place on Thursday, with the final match on Saturday. In Go, players take turns placing stones on a 19-by-19 grid, competing to take control of the most territory. It is considered to be one of the world's most complex games, and is much more challenging for computers than chess. AlphaGo has built up its expertise by studying older matches and playing thousands of games against itself.","Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaGo, has won the first of three matches it is playing against the world's number one Go player, Ke Jie."
"A New York jury found that Mark Scott helped to perpetrate the scheme, routing approximately $400m (£310m) out of the US while working to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds. Prosecutors said he made about $50m. Mr Scott's lawyers had said he did not know that OneCoin was worthless. They said he was simply doing the job asked by Dr Ruja Ignatova, a co-founder of the Bulgaria-based OneCoin. The federal jury in Manhattan rejected those arguments, finding Mr Scott guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud. Dr Ignatova's brother, who testified in the case, also recently pleaded guilty for his role in the fraud. US-based investors claiming to have been defrauded by the scheme are also attempting to sue Mr Scott for recompense in a related case. In total, investigators believe as much as £4bn was raised globally via what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme, with investors based in Uganda, China and the UK among other countries. ""OneCoin used the success story of Bitcoin to induce victims to invest under the guise that they, too, could get rich through their investments,"" New York state attorneys said in one filing. ""This was, of course, completely false because the price of OneCoin was a fiction and not based on supply and demand."" Dr Ignatova, an ex-McKinsey consultant, disappeared from view around October 2017. There has not been a confirmed sighting since. However, the Bulgaria-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing. ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,"" it said in a recent statement given to The Missing Cryptoqueen, a BBC podcast. It added: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully proceedings against OneCoin. We are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a financial revolution will be established."" Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast","A US lawyer has been found guilty for his role in the OneCoin cryptocurrency scam, which raised billions of pounds from investors convinced they were buying into a new digital currency."
"The software, named Perspective, helps identify ""toxic"" language, allowing the newspaper's human moderators to focus on non-offensive posts more quickly. Its algorithms have been trained by feeding them millions of posts previously vetted by the team. By contrast, several other news sites have shut their comments sections. Popular Science, Motherboard, Reuters, National Public Radio, Bloomberg and The Daily Beast are among those to have stopped allowing the public to post their thoughts on their sites, in part because of the cost and effort required to vet them for obscene and potentially libellous content. The BBC restricts comments to a select number of its stories for the same reasons, but as a result many of them end up being complaints about the selection. 'You are ignorant' Until this week, the New York Times typically placed comment sections on about 10% of its stories. But it is now targeting a 25% figure and hopes to raise that to 80% by the year's end. The software works by producing a score out of 100 for how likely it thinks it would be for a human to reject the comment. The human moderators can then choose to check those comments with a low score first rather than going through them in the order they were received, helping speed up how long it takes to get views online. According to Jigsaw - the Google division responsible for the software - use of phrases such as ""anyone who... is a moron"", ""you are ignorant"" and the inclusion of swear words are likely to produce a high mark. ""Most comments will initially be prioritised based on a 'summary score',"" explained the NYT's community editor Bassey Etim. ""Right now, that means judging comments on three factors: their potential for obscenity, toxicity and likelihood to be rejected. ""As the Times gains more confidence in this summary score model, we are taking our approach a step further - automating the moderation of comments that are overwhelmingly likely to be approved."" However, one expert had mixed feelings about the move. ""The idea strikes me as sensible, but likely to restrict forthright debates,"" City University London's Prof Roy Greenslade told the BBC. ""I imagine the New York Times thinks this to be an acceptable form of self-censorship, a price worth paying in order to ensure that hate speech and defamatory remarks are excluded from comments. ""There is also a commercial aspect too. Human moderation costs money. Algorithms are cheaper, but you still need humans to construct them, of course."" Rival AI Jigsaw says the UK's Guardian and Economist are also experimenting with its tech, while Wikipedia is trying to adapt it to tackle personal attacks against its volunteer editors. However, it faces a challenge from a rival scheme called the Coral Project, which released an AI-based tool in April to flag examples of hate speech and harassment in online discussions. The Washington Post and the Mozilla Foundation - the organisation behind the Firefox browser - are both involved in Coral. For its part, the BBC is keeping an open mind about deploying such tools. 'We have systems in place to help moderate comments on BBC articles and we're always interested in ways to improve this,"" said a spokesman. ""This could include AI or machine learning in the future, but we have no current plans.""",The New York Times is enabling comments on more of its online articles because of an artificial intelligence tool developed by Google.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter That was what came into my head as a group of Amazon executives showed me their latest e-reader this week. I'd come to the warehouse in Hoxton - London's Hipster Central, where Amazon's fashion division is based - on the promise of learning about the tech firm's next giant leap forward. I'd rather hoped to hear that the Echo, a fascinating product which puts a virtual assistant inside a speaker, was coming to the UK. Instead I am ushered into a library with a white table where the entire history of the Kindle is laid out, from the 2007 original, a chunky slab with a keyboard, to the slimline touchscreen Voyage. And then the new product, the Oasis is brought out. It is a thing of beauty - slim and light, with a bright, very readable screen, the same page-size as previous Kindles but presented so that the rest of the device seems to melt away. Amazon's vice-president for industrial design, Chris Green, explains that the gold standard is paper, and that the Oasis takes the company another step towards that. ""Our goal is to get the device out of the way and just give you the content.. It's the best reading device we have ever made."" The Wigan-born designer of all of Amazon's devices makes an eloquent case for the technology and craftsmanship which has gone into building the Oasis. He raves about the back of the e-ink display: ""200 microns - thinner than a sheet of tin foil"" and about the ""matrix of components"" that makes for the perfect reading experience. But then I come to the price - £270 (ok, £269.99) for an e-reader! You can get a very nice illuminated touchscreen Kobo for £139, and Amazon's budget version of the Kindle costs just £59.99. And when I canvass opinions amongst colleagues I got this: ""Blooming heck"" (I paraphrase), ""£270 just to read a book?"" Then: ""Think of all the books I could buy for that."" And perhaps most pertinently: ""I've got a phone, I've got a tablet, why do I need a Kindle?"" These days, you can read Kindle books on all sorts of devices, so why buy something separate? Back at the Hoxton warehouse, the Amazon team concedes that there is a smaller market for e-readers than smartphones, but insists there is still a demand for Kindles, and even for a luxury-priced version like the Oasis. ""This isn't going to be our highest volume device, we know that,"" says Jorrit Van der Meulen, who runs the devices business in Europe. ""But for the people who buy it, you're absolutely not going to be able to prise it out of their hands."" The other question is whether the demand for digital books and hence for e-readers has now peaked. The Bookseller reports that UK sales of digital books by the five biggest publishers actually shrank in 2015, although Amazon is keen to stress that self-publishing on Kindle is soaring, and that it's handing more royalties direct to authors. And while Waterstones' boss James Daunt described sales of Kindles as ""pitiful"" last October when he removed them from the shelves in his stores, Amazon tells me ""the e-reader business continues to grow"". What is clear is that selling digital books and e-readers is now just a small part of this technology behemoth's activities and likely to get less significant in the future. Why then the big hoopla over the Kindle Oasis, with Jeff Bezos teasing today's big announcement in a tweet last week? Perhaps because the Kindle was Amazon's first and still most successful venture into hardware, and the signal that it was much more than just a very skilled online retailer. The first version sold out within two hours and instantly made Amazon the leader in the move to digital publishing. Later gadgets - tablets, TV streaming devices, and the ill-fated phone - have had a more mixed reception and have not had the same impact on their markets. Or perhaps the hard-driving Mr Bezos is still just a little sentimental about books and reading. After all, they are the foundation on which his empire was built. ""It's right at the core of our DNA, we started selling books,"" Van der Meulen admits. But he says this is not about the boss's attachment to the past: ""He loves to read, he loves devices but this isn't anything for Jeff, this is years and years of focusing on our customers."" Bezos has said in the past that Amazon's devices are sold at cost - they are designed to sell content rather than to be money-spinners in themselves - and his team insists that the same applies to the Oasis. But it's hard not to think that this Rolls-Royce of an e-reader is a monument to Amazon's past, rather than a signpost to its future.","It has a good claim to being the most daring and innovative technology company of the last 20 years. It has launched at least two world-changing businesses - an online retailer of breathtaking scale and efficiency and a cloud computing service that has changed the way thousands of businesses work. But why on Earth is Amazon launching another Kindle, and who on Earth is going to pay £270 for it?"
